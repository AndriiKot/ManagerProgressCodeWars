    "description": "Your friend (jeweler) came to you with a problem. His scales, which he uses to measure the weight of jewelry, was broken, because he brought down the calibration. But, luckily your friend, the scales have a calibration function. The essence of the function is that on the scale you need to put a certain amount of weight, so that the scales could take this weight as a basis and restore the working state.\nUnfortunately your friend does not have things with exact weight, but there are coins with a known weight.\n\nYour task is to write a function `calibrate` that takes three parameters:   \n`weight`:the weight which is required for calibration;   \n`penny`:the weight of the first avaliable coin;   \n`quarter`:the weight of the second avaliable coin;    \n\nFunction must return a string with two numbers separated by comma, e.g. `\"a,b\"` where the first number is the maximum number of penny coins which satisfies condition `a*penny + b*quarter = weight`\n\nInput data is always defined and correct (weight, penny, quarter > 0). In case if there is no existing combinations, you should return empty string. Good luck!",
