    "description": "# Task\n George took sticks of the `same length` and cut them randomly until all parts are shorter than the original stick. \n \n Now he wants to return sticks to the original state, but he forgot how many sticks he had originally and how long they were originally. \n \n Your task is to help him and design a program which computes the `smallest possible original length` of those sticks. \n \n All lengths expressed in units are positive integers.\n \n# Example\n\n  For `parts = [5, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1]`, the output should be `6`.\n  \n  Perhaps George have 4 sticks with the same length(6), and cut them to: `(5,1),(5,1),(5,1),(2,2,2)`\n  \n  Another answer is `8`, which is 3 sticks cut to `(5,2,1),(5,2,1),(5,2,1)`\n  \n  Or `12`, which is 2 sticks cut to `(5,5,1,1),(5,2,2,2,1)`\n  \n  Or `24`, which is 1 stick cut to `(5, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1)`\n  \n  But the smallest possible length is `6`.\n  \n  For `parts = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, the output should be `10`.\n  \n  \n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input] integer array `parts`\n \n  The lengths of shorter parts.\n  \n  `2 <= parts.length <= 10^7`\n\n  `1 <= part[i] <= 100`\n  \n  \n - `[output]` an integer\n\n  The smallest possible length of original sticks.\n  \n - #Note\n \n   The random tests may contains error, please help me to test it.
