    "description": "Adam Aardvark is fed up of being chosen first in class. His teacher always picks on students in alphabetical order by the first letter of their last name - and with a last name like that, Adam has no chance! He thinks a better way to alphabetically order the class would be by the last letter of their first names, so he can sit comfortably in the middle.\n\nWrite a function that takes in an array of first and last names and returns an array where the names are sorted in alphabetical order by first name in reverse - the last letter of each first name takes priority, then the second last letter, and so on.\n\nFor example:\n\n`[ 'Adam Aardvark', 'Nicholas Miller', 'Paul Genzlinger', 'Winston Schmidt', 'Jessica Day' ]` should return the following -> `[ 'Jessica Day', 'Paul Genzlinger', 'Adam Aardvark', 'Winston Schmidt', 'Nicholas Miller' ]`\n\nThe final letter of 'Jessica' is 'a', so it goes first. The final letter of 'Paul' is 'l', so it goes next, etc.\n\nNote: Array items will always contain one first name and one last name, and empty arrays/arrays containing multiple identical first names will not be provided as arguments.",
