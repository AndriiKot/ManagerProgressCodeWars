    "description": "#Task:\nAs the name may already say, make a function that accepts a block of text and returns `playing card` if the text is talking about playing cards and returns `credit card` if the text is talking about a card as a form of payment. If you cant decide, return `I dont know` (that counts as .1 of the test passed). To pass, you have to get 90% of the tests correct. That means that in the kata testing window you are going to see you passing one test and that is the percentage test. This is also to prevent you from hard-coding the tests.\n#Notes:\n* For Python users, Python 3 is recommended.\n* Please **do not** edit the kata's tests for spelling mistakes. This may cause many solutions becoming invalid.\n* While this kata is in beta, **please** vote and give rank assessments to this kata.\n* Over time, more tests will be added.\n\n#Example:\n```python\n>>> playing_card = '''\nIn early games the kings were always the highest card in their\nsuit. However, as early as the late 15th century special\nsignificance began to be placed on the nominally lowest card, now\ncalled the Ace, so that it sometimes became the highest card and\nthe Two, or Deuce, the lowest. The term \"Ace\" itself comes from a\ndicing term in Anglo-Norman language, which is itself derived from\nthe Latin as the smallest unit of coinage. Another dicing term,\ntrey, sometimes shows up in playing card games. Many governments\nused to raise revenue by imposing a stamp duty on playing cards. As\nthe Ace card has the most blank space, it was usually chosen as the\nplace to bear the stamp which proved the tax was paid. This led to\nelaborate designs of certain ace cards: the ace of spades in\nEngland, the ace of clubs in France, and the ace of diamonds in\nRussia.\n'''\n>>> distinguish(playing_card)\nplaying card\n>>> credit_card = '''\nThe fractured nature of the U.S. banking system under the Glass–Steagall\nAct meant that credit cards became an effective way for those who\nwere traveling around the country to move their credit to places\nwhere they could not directly use their banking facilities. There\nare now countless variations on the basic concept of revolving\ncredit for individuals (as issued by banks and honored by a network\nof financial institutions), including organization-branded credit\ncards, corporate-user credit cards, store cards and so on.\n'''\n>>> distinguish(credit_card)\ncredit card\n```",
