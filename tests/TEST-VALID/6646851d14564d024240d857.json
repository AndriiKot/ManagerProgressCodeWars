    "description": "The farmer wants to build a rectangular barn on his land. However, there are trees and outbuildings on the property that he doesn’t want to move. We can represent the land as an M×N rectangular grid, where each cell contains either a tree/building (denoted by 1) or an empty plot (denoted by 0). The barn must be constructed only on the empty grid cells.\n\nHelp the farmer determine the maximum possible area of the barn he can build.\n\nInput:\n\nN lines, each containing a sequence (without spaces) of M zeros and ones representing the farm layout.\n\nOutput:\n\nPrint the maximum possible area of the barn that the farmer can build.",
