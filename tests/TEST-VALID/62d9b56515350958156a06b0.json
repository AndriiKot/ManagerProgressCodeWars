    "description": "You've stumbled into a dungeon full of Goblins! \n\nLuckily you've brought your bow and a quiver full of arrows.\n\n```quiver[0]```  contains regular arrows\n\n```quiver[1]```  contains arrows that have been enchanted by a powerful wizard\n\n```goblins[0]```  are weak goblins take 1 regular arrow to kill.\n\n```goblins[1]```  are regular goblins and take 2 regular arrows to kill\n\n```goblins[2]```  are boss goblins and take 5 regular arrows to kill. \n\n-An enchanted arrow will kill any type of goblin in 1 hit. \n\n-You are much too stingy to use any remaining enchanted arrows on weak goblins. Even if it means your doom.\n\n\nIf you use all of your enchanted arrows on boss goblins first, and then any left over enchanted arrows on regular goblins, do you have enough arrows to kill all of the goblins and make it out of the dungeon?\n\n\n\n",
