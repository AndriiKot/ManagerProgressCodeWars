    "description": "In the game of spades, there are *four* players. The first dealer is chosen at random, and the turn to deal rotates clockwise. The cards are shuffled and the dealer deals all `52` cards to the other three players in clockwise order beginning with the player on dealer's left until everyone has `13` cards in their hands.\n\nThe first round of the game is for each player to lay down their lowest club, where clubs are ordered from low to high as: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.\n\nOnce all four lowest clubs are on the table, the player who threw the highest of those four cards wins the cards (i.e. that player wins the \"trick\"). If a player has no clubs, he or she must discard a diamond or a heart, and that card has no chance of winning the trick. If a player has no clubs, no hearts, and no diamonds, then the player must play a spade, and will be guaranteed to win the trick.\n\nGiven a card given in the format *\\\"2H\\\"* , where *\\\"2\\\"* is the value and *\\\"H\\\"* stands for hearts which is the suit, compute for the winning probability of that card. Results must contain two significant digits after the decimal.\n\nNote: Tolerance is `4e-2`\n\nSample Input | Sample Output\n--|--\n2C | 0\n10C | 9.08\nKC | 3.49\n9C | 11.87\n2S | 0\nAH | 0\n",
