    "description": "This challenge reminds of high school days.\n\nA point mass `m2` is placed at origin of cartesian plane.\nAnother point mass `m1` moving with velocity `u1`,\nat an angle `theta` (measured in degrees in counter clockwise direction with respect to negative `x` axis)\nwith velocity `v1` strikes `m2`.\n\nThe collision is perfectly [elastic](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/elacol2.html).\n\nThe surface between `-1 < x < 1` and `-1 < y < 1` is perfectly smooth, whereas surface outside of this square has friction coefficient `K`.\n\nConstraints:\n+ 0 <= `theta` <= 90\n+ `g` = 9.8 (m/s^2)\n+ `m1`, `m2` > 0\n\nreturn a  tuple containing\n\n`((final_coordinates1), (final_coordinates2))` in same order.\nNote:the answers should be rounded off to second decimal place.\n     final_coordinates are final (x,y) coordinates after the objects come to      rest.\n     \n     The block m1 starts in the frictionless sqr with velocity u1.\n\nNote: Basic [equation of motion](https://www.onlinemathlearning.com/kinematics-suvat.html) of newtonian mechanics have been used.\n\n\n",
