    "description": "Normally in the newspapers we can read news like \"this has been the hottest month since...\", but calculating this milestone is not easy if there is a lot of data.\n\nFor each id and number, the following must be returned:\n\n* the previous id that had a strictly greater number than the one provided\n* the id of the provided if there was no greater element (or it is the first)\n\nThere are solutions in O(n^2), but one with cost O(n) is required. The test space is over 10^6 elements. Optimization is mandatory. You don´t need more than O(n) in space cost.\n\nIn the example provided, the id = \"1/1999\" is greater than all the others that are provided until the element \"4/1999\" is entered, which has \"3/1999\" as its maximum.",
