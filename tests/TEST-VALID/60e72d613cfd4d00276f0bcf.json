    "description": "Make a chain of dominoes.\n\nCompute a way to order a given set of dominoes in such a way that they form a correct domino chain (the dots on one half of a stone match the dots on the neighbouring half of an adjacent stone) and that dots on the halfs of the stones which don't have a neighbour (the first and last stone) match each other.\n\nFor example given the stones [2|1], [2|3] and [1|3] you should compute something like [1|2] [2|3] [3|1] or [3|2] [2|1] [1|3] or [1|3] [3|2] [2|1] etc, where the first and last numbers are the same.\n\nFor stones [1|2], [4|1] and [2|3] the resulting chain is not valid: [4|1] [1|2] [2|3]'s first and last numbers are not the same. 4 != 3\n\nSome test cases may use duplicate stones in a chain solution, assume that multiple Domino sets are being used.",
