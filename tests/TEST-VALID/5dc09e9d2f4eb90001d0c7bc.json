    "description": "Imagine you have 4 identical regular tetrahedrons (a pyramid whose base and faces are all congruent, equilateral triangles). You could (theoretically) arrange three of them on a table so that their bases form a larger triangle like a triforce -- a symbol from The Legend of Zelda, it might help to google this if you're not familiar -- and the 4th tetrahedron could sit on top, each point of its base touching one of the top vertices of the 3 tetrahedrons sitting on the table. Here's a rough picture of what it would look like:\n\n![](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/0a/77/5f/54/d1/2ad5432350ae87544ec33a6647e7064e_preview_featured.jpg)\n\nThis structure would indicate a larger tetrahedron that is similar to the smaller ones but where each edge would be twice as long. Furthermore, you could continue this pattern adding a third layer underneath. This new base layer would again extend the larger tetrahedron formed by the many smaller tetrahedrons, each edge of which would now be 3 times as long as the edges of the small, individual tetrahedrons. As you can imagine (and see in the linked picture above) this creates interesting negative space inside the tetrahedron.\n\n**Task**\n\nGiven the total volume (`v`) of a tetrahedron made up of smaller tetrahedrons as described above, and the number of layers (`l`) that it comprises, return the volume of the 'hollow space' within the tetrahedron, that is, how much of the larger tetrahedron's volume is _not_ composed of smaller, similar tetrahedrons.\n\n**Example**\n\n```javascript\nhollowSpace(8,2) === 4\n/* a tetrahedron with volume of 8 units³ that\ncomprises 2 layers of similar tetrahedrons\nwould have 4 units³ of empty space within it */\n```\n```haskell\nhollowSpace 8 2 == 4\n{- a tetrahedron with volume of 8 units³ that\ncomprises 2 layers of similar tetrahedrons\nwould have 4 units³ of empty space within it -}\n```",
