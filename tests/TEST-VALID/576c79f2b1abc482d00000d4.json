    "description": "In mathematics, the Kolakoski sequence is an infinite sequence of symbols {1,2} which is its own run-length encoding. The Kolakoski sequence starts out like this:\n\n    12211212212211211221211212211...\n    \nThe sequence may be generated by an algorithm that, in the ith iteration, reads the value xi that has already been output as the ith value of the sequence (or, if no such value has been output yet, sets xi = i). Then, if i is odd, it outputs xi copies of the number 1, while if i is even, it outputs xi copies of the number 2.\n\nRead more about the sequence [here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KolakoskiSequence.html).\n\nWrite a function that returns a string representation of a sequence of `r` runs of the Kolakoski sequence.",
