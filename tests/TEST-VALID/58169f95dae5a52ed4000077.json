    "description": "Your task is simple, given the data you must calculate on each day how many products were sold accross all departments. But this is not how we want our data displayed, we want to pivot the table to the columns become the products name and each row will contain the amount of products sold for each day ordered by the day.\n\nThe resultant table is hard to map but the basics are;\n### return table:\n- day\n- product names (... for each product the column header must be the name of the product)\n\nBecause product names have spaces you must replace the spaces with underscores. The number of products sold will change with each submit and the names will too so you must account for this.\n\n### Tables and relationship below:\n<img src=\"//i.imgur.com/kBkwsbi.png\" />\n\n\n#### Notes:\n- There may be an error on submit, this may be because the random generator generated two individual products with the same name. resubmit to avoid this error.\n- Codewars normally processes each statement (seperated by a `;`) as a seperate operation. If you need to process multiple statements in the same operation, you will need to begin the next statement on the same line as the previous one ends on.\n",
