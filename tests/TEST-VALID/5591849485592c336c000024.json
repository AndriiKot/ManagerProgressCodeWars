    "description": "As a brand new university student you have some exciting events scheduled in your planner. Unfortunately you dropped your awesome planner, spilling the pages, and now your events are all out or order! You like to have things organized, so decide to write a program to help get things sorted.\n\nWrite a method named `order_dates` that accepts a hash of events as a parameter. Keys in the hash will be the date of the event (a Ruby `Date`) and the value will be the event description (`String`):\n\t\n\t{\n      Date.parse('13-7-2015') => \"dance off with Bailey\",\n\t  Date.parse('10-6-2015') => \"movie with Ash and friends\",\n      Date.parse('1-8-2015') => \"game night at Jamie's\"\n\t}\n\nThe output should be an Array of strings representing the events formatted as a sentence. The elements in the array should be ordered by date. The following is an example of the correct output for the above hash:\n\n\t[\n      “On June 10 you have a movie with Ash and friends.”, \n      “On July 13 you have a dance off with Bailey.”, \n      “On August 1 you have a game night at Jamie’s.”\n    ]",
