    "description": "This Kata is based on Kata \"Simple Fun #148: Exchange Sort(myjinxin2015)\", but this time the input sequence is not restricted to 3 different elements, only.\n\n## Task\n\nSorting is one of the most basic computational devices used in Computer Science.\n\nGiven a sequence (length ≤ 5000) of values (duplicates allowed), your task is to find the minimum number of exchange operations necessary to make the sequence sorted.\n\nOne operation is the switching of 2 key values in the sequence.\n\n## Example\n\nFor sequence = [\"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"B\", \"C\"], the result should be 0.\n\n```\nIt's already a sorted sequence.\n```\n\nFor sequence = [9, -2, 1, 1, 9, -2], the result should be 1.\n```\nWe can switching sequence[0] and sequence[5].\n```\n\nFor sequence = [1, 2, 3, 0], the result should be 3.\n```\nWe can:\n [1, 2, 3, 0] \n switching sequence[0] and sequence[3]\n --> [0, 2, 3, 1]\n switching sequence[1] and sequence[3]\n --> [0, 1, 3, 2]\n switching sequence[2] and sequence[3]\n --> [0, 1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nFor sequence = [8, 8, 3, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 3], the result should be 4.\n```\nWe can:\n [8, 8, 3, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 3] \n switching sequence[0] and sequence[3]\n --> [9, 8, 3, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 3]\n switching sequence[0] and sequence[8]\n --> [3, 8, 3, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9]\n switching sequence[1] and sequence[2]\n --> [3, 3, 8, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9]\n switching sequence[5] and sequence[7]\n --> [3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9] \nSo 4 is the minimum number of operations for the sequence to become sorted.\n```\n\n## Input/Output\n\n    [input] array sequence\n\nThe Sequence.\n\n    [output] an integer\n\nthe minimum number of operations needed to completly sort the input sequence.\n",
