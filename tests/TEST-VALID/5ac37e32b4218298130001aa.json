    "description": "The React pattern to apply to this kata is [Lifting State up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html) reading the docs will help.\n\n> Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. Let’s see how this works in action.\n\n## Objective\n\nStar Trek The United Federation of Planets is testing out their new transporter technology.\n\nStatey needs to successfully transport three people from a planet to the Enterprise and three other people from Enterprise to the planet. (With none of them dying).\n\nThere are three components defined for you `Universe`, `Planet` and `Starship` but each of them of have missing features to transport a person.\n\nThe Planet and Star ship have inhabitants only known to themselves.\n\n* Clicking a transport button for a person should trigger the tranport process\n* When being transported a person should be removed from one inhabitants list to the other. e.g A person from a Planet should be removed and added to the Star ship.\n* The `Planet` and `Starship` should have a `transport` prop for \"Lifting state up\"\n* The `Planet` and `Starship` will need `componentWillReceiveProps` to update Person passed through\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\nPaired with [Rob Adams](https://www.codewars.com/users/sultanhq)",
