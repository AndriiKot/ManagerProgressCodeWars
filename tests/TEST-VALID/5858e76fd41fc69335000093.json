    "description": "You and some of your friends are invited to a birthday party and you decide to buy the present together.\nLaura buys a CD, Steve buys some flowers and Sophie buys a bottle of Whiskey. Afterwards you want to even the costs out.\n\nYour task is now to calculate who owes whom how much money given an array of expenses everyone had.\n\nExample: A pays 10€, B pays 20€ and C pays nothing. Then C has to give B 10€ to even things out.\n\nSince the solution will not be unique it is only tested if everyone has had the same costs afterwards. Amounts of money that are less than 0.01€ can be considered zero.\n\nTo make things more interesting. The test cases will consist of up to 1e6 entries.\n",
