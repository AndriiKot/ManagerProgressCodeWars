    "description": "A company of students is going to spend their free time wisely. All they have to decide is what should they buy today: vodka or beer?\n\nWrite a function that will help these guys to have a good time as many days in a row as possible and save as much money as possible too! Days amount is always a priority here! \n\nIf they can't afford even 1 good day, return 'BUMMER!'\n\nEvery single student needs no less than 1 vodka/day OR 8 beers/day. \n1 vodka costs 30$, and 1 beer — only 4$.\nBUT! If they've got enough money to buy at least (>=) 2 cases of beer (24 beer in each), they have a super-beer-discount, and one beer costs only 3$!\n\nYou may assume that there will always be an input, it will always be a number, number of people is more than 0, and at least one of the students is above 21.\n\nExample: \n```javascript\ndrinkResponsibly(5, 180)) => 'VODKA!' \n// Vodka case: 5 * 30 = 150$ => 1 good day and 30$ left. \n// Beer case: 5 * (4 * 8) = 160$ => 1 good day and 20$ left.\n```\n\n```javascript\ndrinkResponsibly(5, 360)) => 'BEER!' \n// Vodka case: 5 * 30 * 2 = 300$ => 2 good days and 60$ left. \n// Beer case: 5 * (3 * 8) * 2 = 360$ => 3 good days and 0$ left.\n```",
