    "description": "Blowfish is an old & complex encryption algorithm.\n\nwe took few elements from it to create our own simple version of this algorithm.\n\nour encryption method should get 2 Strings - plainText and password. which can be any string.\n\nthe encryption algorithm: we are doing *speical XOR* between every char of the plainText with the parallel char of the password - if the password is shorter than the plainText then it runs in a loop and start over from it's first char. (example: plain text:\"ab\", password:\"a\" -> we should do 'a' special XOR 'a', 'b' special XOR 'a')\n\nSpecial XOR = doing XOR between 2 chars only that the second char's first 8 bits(from the left) are swapped with it's last 8 bits(the right ones). for example:\nspecial XOR of 2 chars(bits representing) -> 1100110010101010 with 0001110011100111 is actually 1100110010101010 XOR 1110011100011100.\n\nthe second char was 0001110011100111 - so we swapped it's bits to 1110011100011100\n\nGood luck.\n\n\n",
