    "description": "# The Game of Tic-Tac-Toe\n\nThe game of Tic-Tac-Toe is played by two players, `X` and `O`. Each player takes a turn by placing their letter into an unoccupied square on a 3x3 grid. The winner is the first to gain 3 squares in a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe\n\n---\n\n# Task\n\nGiven a game board representation in which each of the 3 rows of the grid is separated by a pipe (`|`) character and empty squares by a dot (`.`) character, decide whether `X` won the game, `O` won the game or if it was a tie.\n\nThe messages should be one of the following:\n\n* \"Player X is the winner\"\n* \"Player O is the winner\"\n* \"Game is a tie\"\n\n---\n\nFor example, the following string:\n\n```\nxox|x.o|xo.\n```\n\nrepresents a board that looks like this:\n\n```\nx o x\nx   o\nx o\n```\n\nThe result should be `\"Player X is the winner\"` because player X occupied the first column.",
