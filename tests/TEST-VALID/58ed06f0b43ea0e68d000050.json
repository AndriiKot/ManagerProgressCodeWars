    "description": "You have a Python iterable, containing integer values, which are either zero or one.\nThe iterable can be a list, a tuple, a dict, a set, etc. or a user defined one.\n\nYour goal is to design a function that checks whether the number of ones in the iterable equals a given number using only the Python functions my_all() and my_any(), which behave exactly like the Python builtins all() and any().\n\n\nFor example:\n\nonly_n_ones([1, 0, 0, 0, 1], 2) equals True\n\nand\n\nonly_n_ones((1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0), 4)) equals False\n\nAttention: The difficulty of the Kata is to find a solution using only the all() and any() Python builtins! For our case to facilitate the test cases, please use my_all() and my_any() instead.\n\nHint 1: You may also use range() and another builtin that we won't reveal at the moment but it is neither map nor lambda!\n\nHint 2: Remember to use both my_any() and  my_all(). The solution is really elegant!\n\n",
