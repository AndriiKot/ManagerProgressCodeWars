    "description": "The difficult time passed, you don't have to be a peasant and you will never starve anymore: now you are a [food taster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_taster) of Edward I, also known as Edward Hated. Enjoy the royal delicacies and test if it contains a poison!\n\nGiven an array of strings of different characters. Return the first found index of a string that contains each of letters `p` `o` `i` `s` `o` `n` (case-insensitive, in any order) and add 1 to your result(it means the day when you died). If there weren't strings with poison, return 0(you will stay alive).\n\n## Notes: \n- a string must contain two letters `o`(case-insensitive)\n\nIf you like this kata, check out the another one: \n[Last Survivor Ep.1](https://www.codewars.com/kata/609eee71109f860006c377d1)",
