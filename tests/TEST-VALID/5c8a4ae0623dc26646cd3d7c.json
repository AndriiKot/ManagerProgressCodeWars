    "description": "Biathlon is an amazing sport combining cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. If I asked you to give me a famous biathlete's name, you might give me Martin Fourcade (FRA), Johannes T. Boe (NOR), Laura Dahlmeier (GER), Dorothea Wierer (ITA) and plenty of others.\n\n**Individual race**\n\nThe individual race is the most challenging event. Biathletes run a distance of 20 Km (men) or 15 Km (women) and shoot 4 x 5 bullets. __Each missed shot gives a 60-second penalty__. The lowest time wins.\n\n**What you're asked to code**\n\nWe'd like to calculate real time according to skiing time and missed shots.\n\nThe function has 2 parameters:\n- Time in tenths of a second (e.g: 200 => 200 tenths of a second => 20 seconds) the biathlete needed to finish the race\n- Number of misses\n\nThe __time will always be valid__ whereas the __number of misses won't__. If there's a __negative number of misses__ or if it's __greater than 20__, return __false__.\n\nIn valid cases, __return the time with the format _MINUTES:SECONDS:TENTHS___. Do not convert minutes to hours if they are greater than 60.\n\n__If the number of seconds is lower than 10, add a zero before it__. (See example test cases #1 and #2: it should return 34:07:0 but not 34:7:0)\n\n**Example cases**\n\n- __individualResult(18670, 3)__ should return _34:07:0_ (race time of 31:07:0 + 3 minutes of penalty)\n- __individualResult(7364, 8)__ should return _20:16:4_ (race time of 12:16:4 + 8 minutes of penalty)\n- __individualResult(15000, 21)__ should return _false_ since the number of penalties is greater than 20\n- __individualResult(15000, -3)__ should return _false_ too since the number of penalties cannot be negative",
