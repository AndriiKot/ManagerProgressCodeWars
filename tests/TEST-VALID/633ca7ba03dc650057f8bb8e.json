    "description": "# Newton-Raphson Method (for the General Case)\n\n## Background\n\nThe Newton-Raphson method is a algorithm for finding zeroes of a particular function. While most often used to find roots of a polynomial, the Newton-Raphson method can be used to find the zeroes of any differentiable function of one variable.\n\nDefining x<sub>0</sub> as the initial guess of the zero for the function, the sequence of guesses is defined as follows:\n\n![Newton-Raphson method equation](https://i.ibb.co/tHXhs5q/lagrida-latex-editor.png)\n\nThere are cases where the method will fail to converge; you will not have to handle these. However, it should be able to handle different initial guesses.\n\n## Your Challenge\n\nGiven a function in one variable, an initial guess for the method, and the number of iterations to perform, return the final result of the method after all iterations. The function can be any differentiable function that has one or more real roots; it is not restricted to being a polynomial!\n\nAnswers are valid if they have an error of less than 0.1% from the actual value.\n\n(As this is my first time writing a kata, feedback and translations are welcomed with open arms.)",
