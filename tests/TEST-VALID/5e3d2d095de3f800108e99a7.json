    "description": "# Calculate the interest paid per year with daily accuracy and the actual number of days per year (act/act).\n\nIt is the end of the year and the bank has to calculate how much interest to pay you. It pays the interest with a daily accuracy and over the actual days per year. This method of calculating interest is called act/act. Some other methods assume 30 days per month and 360 days per year (30/360), but we want to calculate the interest more accurately.\n\nTo achieve this you need a couple of things:\n- A list of transactions of which each transaction is a tuple of an ISO time string and the value of the transaction.\n```python\n('2015-04-20 10:12:13', 123.45)\n```\n- The initial balance, e.g. 1000, meaning the balance at the start of the year\n- The interest rate per year, e.g. 0.02 for 2% interest per year.\n\nLet's get into an example to make things a little clearer:  \nLet's say we want to calculate the total interest paid in the year 2019 for a bank account with the following transactions\n```python\n[('2019-04-20 10:12:13', 100.00), ('2019-10-11 16:45:00', 25.50)]\n```\nand an initial balance of 1000 and an interest rate per year of 0.025 or 2.5%\n\nThe interest rate per day is **0.025 / 365 = 0.000068493150685** because the year **2019 had 365 days** (no leap year)  \nOur first interest period is **2019-01-01 - 2019-04-20** which is **109 days** long and the balance for that period was **1000**  \nThe second interest period is **2019-04-20 - 2019-10-11** which is **174 days** long and the balance for that period was **1100**  \nThe last interest period is **2019-10-11 - 2020-01-01** which is **82 days** long and the balance for that period was **1125.50**  \n\nThe total interest paid can then be calculated using the interest per day for these periods:  \nFirst period: **1000 * 0.000068493150685 * 109 = 7.465753424657534**  \nSecond period: **1100 * 0.000068493150685 * 174 = 13.10958904109589**  \nThird period: **1125.50 * 0.000068493150685 * 82 = 6.321301369863014**\n\nResulting in a total interest paid of **26.89664383561644** or **26.90** when rounded to two decimal places.  \nThe balance at the end of the year would therefore be **1152.40**\n\nNotes:\n- The transactions are all in the same year;\n- If the balance becomes negative over a period of the year, the same interest rate is still used, resulting in negative interest for that period;\n- Interest is paid starting from the day of the transaction (a transaction on December 31st would still get interest for one day);\n- The final balance has to be rounded to two decimal places;\n- Transactions are not necessarily ordered by date;\n- No rounding takes place during the calculation.\n",
