    "description": "<p>\nThe password is send through an electrical wire and have hardware support to decrypt and encrypt the key. \n</p>\n<p>\nYou know that how the encryption works, but you need to figure out the xor value to decrypt it. You have collected many of the encrypted passwords from a recycle bin and tried to figure out the XOR value.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe <i><b>code</b></i>, is encrypted in the following way:\n\nThe <i><b>code</b></i> is subdivided into 8 bytes. The each byte is xored with some value between 0 - 255. Then reverse order of the byte. Final, each bit will get send through a NOT gate.\n<br>\n\nFor example, if the code is 2.\nThe table below show the value is being subdivided.\n<table>\n  \n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      1\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      2\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      3\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      4\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      5\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      6\n    </td>\n     <td>\n      7\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      8\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  \n   \n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      00000000\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      00000000\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      00000000\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      00000000\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      00000000\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      00000000\n    </td>\n     <td>\n      00000000\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      00000010\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<br>\nTo simplify the example, xor value is 0b00000000 for everything. Though in the problem, you will have 8 different xor value to decipher.   \n<table>\n  \n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      8\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      7\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      6\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      5\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      4\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      3\n    </td>\n     <td>\n      2\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      1\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  \n   \n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      00000010\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      00000000\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      00000000\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      00000000\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      00000000\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      00000000\n    </td>\n     <td>\n      00000000\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      00000000\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  \n \n</table>\n  Then NOT every bit in the table above. <br>\n0b11111101 follow by 56's 1 should be -72341280990234368.\n\n</p>",
