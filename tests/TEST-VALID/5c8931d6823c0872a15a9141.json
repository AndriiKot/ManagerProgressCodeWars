    "description": "A Tombola is a British game in which people pick tickets out of a revolving drum and certain tickets win a prize. Tombolas are often found at fetes and fairs. Tickets are commonly taken from a Raffle book and include the numbers 1 to 999.\n\nWinning tickets must contain a certain number, or have a certain characteristic; some examples are:\n\n1 \"Any ticket containing a 7 wins\"\n2 \"Any ticket ending with a 5 or a 0 wins\"\n\nTaking the simpler first option of any ticket containing a certain number, could you please write a function which returns the number of winning tickets in a raffle book. The number can be one or two digits.\n\nYour function should take two values; the total number of tickets (you can assume the ticket book starts at 1) and the number which must be present for a ticket to win.\n\n![A Tombola](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lyNnuDFGL._SY355_.jpg)",
