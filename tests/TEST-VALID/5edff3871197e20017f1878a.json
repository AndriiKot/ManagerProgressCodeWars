    "description": "Crazed eyes of ravenous wolves fixate on their target. The chase is over. Cave walls surround the boy -- he has nowhere to run. Strange symbols line the walls, and fragments of egg shells crumble beneath his feet. He unsheathes his shortsword, grips his bow, and turns to face the pack.\n\nWrite a function that takes the distances of the wolves from the boy and returns the number of turns it will take to defeat them all.\n\n**Combat Rules:**\n- Distance is measured in integers\n- Wolves move closer by 1 each turn\n- Boy can take 3 actions per turn\n\n**Actions:**\n- Melee: *kills in one hit, distance: 1*\n- Ranged: *kills in two hits, distance: 2 - 4*\n\n\n\n**Example:**\nIf there are 3 wolves at a distance of 1, 2 and 5, the boy can make a melee attack, and two ranged attacks to take down two wolves in one turn. On the next turn, the wolf at distance 5 is now in range, and he can make two more ranged attacks to take down the final wolf. The total is two turns.\n\nReturn 0 if it's not possible to defeat them all",
