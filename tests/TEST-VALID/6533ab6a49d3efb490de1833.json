    "description": "# Wordle Checker\n\nIn this programming exercise, your goal is to implement the `wordle_checker` function, which simulates the functionality of the popular game \"Wordle.\" Just like in Wordle, your task is to provide feedback on the `user_input` and the target `word` by creating a list that contains elements representing the match status for each character. These elements can be \"green,\" \"yellow,\" or \"red.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe function should follow these rules:\n\n1. If the lengths of `user_input` and `word` are different, return 0.\n\n2. If a character in `user_input` matches the character at the same index in `word`, mark that position in the result list as \"green.\"\n\n3. If a character in `user_input` is present in `word` but not in the correct position, mark that position in the result list as \"yellow.\" Note that the same character from `word` can turn one or multiple character(s) \"yellow\" if it's not already marked as \"green.\"\n\n4. Any character that is not marked as \"green\" or \"yellow\" should be marked as \"red.\"\n\n## Extra Challenge (Optional)\n\nFor an additional challenge, you can attempt to modify the `user_input` in place while solving the kata.\n",
