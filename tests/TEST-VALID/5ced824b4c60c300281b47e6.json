    "description": "A strobogrammatic number is a number whose numeral is rotationally symmetric, so that it appears the same when rotated 180 degrees. In other words, the numeral looks the same right-side up and upside down (eg. 6969, 10801).\n\nTherefore, a strobogrammatic prime is any strobogrammatic number that is also prime, ie. only divisible by itself and one.\n\nYour task is to write a method that, given the upper and lower bounds of a range of integers, returns the total number of strobogrammatic primes within said range (inclusive).\n\n_For example_...\n\n```\nstrobogrammatic_primes(0, 10) # => 0\nstrobogrammatic_primes(0, 200) # => 3\nstrobogrammatic_primes(10_000, 19_000) # => 2\n```\n\nThe lower bound (`a`) will never be less than 1, and the upper bound (`b`) will never be greater than 3,000,000.\n\n",
