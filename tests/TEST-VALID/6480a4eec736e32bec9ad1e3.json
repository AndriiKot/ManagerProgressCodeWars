    "description": "Write a function `joinArraysById` in JavaScript that takes two arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`, as input. Each array contains objects that have an `id` field with an integer value. The function should merge `arr1` and `arr2` based on their `id` key and return a new array, `joinedArray`, as the result.\n\nThe `joinedArray` should be formed by following these rules:\n\n- The length of `joinedArray` should be equal to the length of unique `id` values from both arrays combined.\n- The objects with unique `id` values from `arr1` and `arr2` should be included in the `joinedArray` without modification.\n- If two objects share the same `id`, their properties should be merged into a single object:\n  - If a key only exists in one object, include that key-value pair in the merged object.\n  - If a key exists in both objects, the value from `arr2` should override the value from `arr1`.\n- The `joinedArray` should be sorted in ascending order based on the `id` key.\n\nExample 1:\n\n```javascript\nconst arr1 = [\n  { id: 1, x: 1 },\n  { id: 2, x: 9 },\n]\nconst arr2 = [{ id: 3, x: 5 }]\n\nconsole.log(joinArraysById(arr1, arr2))\n// Output: [\n//   { \"id\": 1, \"x\": 1 },\n//   { \"id\": 2, \"x\": 9 },\n//   { \"id\": 3, \"x\": 5 }\n// ]\n```\n\nIn the above example, there are no duplicate `ids`, so `arr1` is simply concatenated with `arr2`.\n\nExample 2:\n\n```javascript\nconst arr1 = [\n  { id: 1, x: 2, y: 3 },\n  { id: 2, x: 3, y: 6 },\n]\nconst arr2 = [\n  { id: 2, x: 10, y: 20 },\n  { id: 3, x: 0, y: 0 },\n]\n\nconsole.log(joinArraysById(arr1, arr2))\n// Output: [\n//   { \"id\": 1, \"x\": 2, \"y\": 3 },\n//   { \"id\": 2, \"x\": 10, \"y\": 20 },\n//   { \"id\": 3, \"x\": 0, \"y\": 0 }\n// ]\n```\n\nIn the above example, the objects with `id=1` and `id=3` are included in the result array without modification. The two objects with `id=2` are merged together, and the keys from `arr2` override the values from `arr1`.\n\nExample 3:\n\n```javascript\nconst arr1 = [{ id: 1, b: { b: 94 }, v: [4, 3], y: 48 }]\nconst arr2 = [{ id: 1, b: { c: 84 }, v: [1, 3] }]\n\nconsole.log(joinArraysById(arr1, arr2))\n// Output: [\n//   { \"id\": 1, \"b\": { \"c\": 84 }, \"v\": [1, 3], \"y\": 48 }\n// ]\n```\n\nIn the above example, the two objects with `id=1` are merged together. The values for the keys `\"b\"` and `\"v\"` are taken from `arr2`, and since the key `\"y\"` only exists in `arr1`, its value is taken from `arr1`.\n\nNotes: \n  - The solution should handle the inclusion of original items in the merged array. If necessary, the objects can be shallow or deep copies, as long as the modifications mentioned above are applied.\n",
