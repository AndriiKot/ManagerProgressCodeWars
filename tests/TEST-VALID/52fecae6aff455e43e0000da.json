    "description": "We want to layout ordered sections of a document in a multi-columned page.  Each section has the same width but variable height, and you can infinitely scroll the document vertically.\n\n\nWe want to layout the sections in columns with the following contraints:\n\n1. The sections maintain their order, e.g. in the example below, Sec 2 cannot come before Sec 1.\n\n2. The maximum difference between the heights of any two columns is minimized.  e.g. in the example below, the difference in heights has been minimized from any other possible layout (it's 0)\n\nSo for example, if we wanted to layout 5 ordered sections with heights 1, 1, 2, 1, and 1 in three columns, we would layout the sections in columns like so:\n\n```\n| -Col 0- | -Col 1- | -Col 2- |\n| [Sec 0] | [ Sec ] | [Sec 3] |\n| [Sec 1] | [  2  ] | [Sec 4] |\n```\n\nWrite a function called getColumns(sections, numCols) that takes two arguments as input: an array of ordered section heights and the number of columns.  You should return an array of integers where the value at the ith position of the array represents the starting index of the ith column.\n\n```javascript\ngetColumns([1, 1, 2, 1, 1], 3) // returns [0, 2, 3]\ngetColumns([3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 1) // returns [0]\ngetColumns([1, 1, 1, 1, 5], 3) // returns [0, 2, 4]\n```\n\nYou can assume that numCols will always be a positive integer and that the number of sections will always be greater than or equal to the number of columns passed in.  Also, in terms of test cases, you won't be given data that has multiple solutions.",
