    "description": "Learn how to use recompose's *withProps* higher-order component (HOC) for React JS.\n\n- https://recompose.docsforhumans.com/api/withprops.html\n- https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html\n\n**Your challenge:**\n\nUse the withProps HOC to transform the supplied props\n\n- Create a new HOC called WithTitle using withProps HOC\n- It should accept the param `props` and return a new object with a property called title\n- The title prop should be set to \"Your basket is empty\", when props.items has a length of 0\n- The title prop should be set to \"You have ${props.items.length} items in your basket\", when props.items is greater than 0\n\nNB. Study the tests to see how your WithTitle HOC will be used. In particular the Page component and PageWithTitle, which is composed by wrapping Page with WithTitle.\n\nEnjoy!",
