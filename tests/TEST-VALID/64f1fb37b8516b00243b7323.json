    "description": "Your car measures speed by simply counting how many times the tire (more specifically the axel) makes a full rotation in one second. It is converted to miles per hour by comparing the car's internal rev/mile to what is measured. Here's an example:\n```\nA tire gets 672 rev/mile.\nWe measure a speed of 12.13 rev/sec\nThis is equal to 728 rev/min or 43680 rev/hr\n43680 revolutions in an hour divided by 672 miles per revolution gives us: 65 mph\n```\nTire revolutions per mile are calculated with a simple formula. First you get the diameter by multiplying the tire circumfrence by pi. Then you divide the total number of inches in a mile (`63,360`) by the circumference, and you have the rev/mile for that tire. The thing about tires is that they use a very specific numbering system that is logical, but not intuitive to most car owners. [See more here](https://tiresize.com/calculator/). If our tire size is: `200-70-R19`, to get the acutal diameter of the tire (not the diameter of the wheel) we need to make the following calculation:\n```\n(200 * 70 / 2540 * 2) + 19\n```\nWrite a function that returns our current speed in miles per hour as an integer. It should accept two arguments: tire size as a string, and speed measured in revolutions per second as a float. Some example inputs are below:\n```\nTire Size: \"200-70-R19\" rev/sec: 12.13  ->  65\n\nTire Size: \"155-15-R13\" rev/sec: 24.80  ->  65\n\nTire Size: \"315-80-R30\" rev/sec: 7.35  ->  65\n\n```\n",
