    "description": "Implement a new mutex class `DebugMutex` with the following two main metods:\n\n- `lock`: if a mutex is not acquired by anybody, acquire it; otherwise, wait until it is released by the current owner\n- `unlock`: release a mutex acquired by this thread; if some oter thread is waiting for it, let that thread acquire it\n\n`DebugMutex` should detect \"simple deadlock\" conditions. A \"simple deadlock\" is the following sequence:\n\n- Thread1 acquires Mutex1\n- Thread2 acquires Mutex2\n- Thread1 waits on Mutex2\n- Thread2 waits on Mutex1 -- *oops, they will never wake up, as they wait for each other*\n\nIn case when a \"simple deadock\" is detected, `DeadlockError` should be raised. `DeadlockError` should have the following attributes:\n\n- `threads`: array of Thread objects: the 2 threads participating in the deadlock\n- `mutexes`: array of DebugMutex objects: the 2 mutexes participating in the deadlock\n\nBelow is an illustration of the expected behavior:\n```\nmx1 = DebugMutex.new\nmx2 = DebugMutex.new\n\nmx1.lock\nthread2 = Thread.new do\n  mx2.lock\n  mx1.lock\nend\nsleep 0.1\n\nbegin\n  mx2.lock # should raise DeadlockError\nrescue DeadlockError => e\n  e.threads # => [Thread.current,thread2] in any order\n  e.mutexes # => [mx1,mx2] in any order\nend\n\n```",
