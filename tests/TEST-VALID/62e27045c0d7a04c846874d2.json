    "description": "# Introduction\n\nJon has an RGB colour (in hex form), such as `#ABC123`\n\nThe RGB hex `#ABC123` is structured in the following way:\n\n`#` is the Hex Identifier  \n`AB` is the amount of Red  \n`C1` is the amount of Green  \n`23` is the amount of Blue\n\n# Your task\n\nHelp Jon construct a function that changes the given Hex-String to a new one which is slightly lighter / darker. It takes two parameters:\n\n`rgb` is the Hex-String of the RGB colour (may be lowercase or uppercase)\n\n`percent` is the percentage by which to make it darker. Negative percentages should make it lighter. If this **parameter is not supplied**, you should default to **10%**. (**Standard rounding** should be used when calculating `percent` changes)\n\n# Important Notes\n-The output must be a lowercase Hex-String  \n-The output must be a valid RGB-Hex (as described above)",
