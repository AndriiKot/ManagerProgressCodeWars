    "description": "Prehistory:\n\nOnce upon a time, in the vibrant world of Codetopia, a land where coding wizards and algorithm sorcerers thrived, a new spell was about to be cast. The wizards of Codetopia were enchanted by the idea of spreading joy and excitement through their messages. They believed that by amplifying the power of vowels, they could make their words even more magical and enchanting.\n\nA group of enthusiastic wizards, led by the legendary CodeMaster, decided to embark on a quest to create the ultimate spell – a function that could increase the number of vowels in any message. They envisioned a world where every greeting, proclamation, or incantation echoed with the melodious charm of multiplied vowels.\n\nThe CodeMaster, filled with zeal and excitement, gathered the brightest minds in Codetopia to devise the perfect incantation. They called it the \"Vowel Increaser Spell.\" The spell would take a message and a multiplier as inputs, and the result would be a message resonating with the amplified energy of vowels.\n\nTask:\n\nIn this kata, you're tasked with writing a function that increases the number of vowels in a given string. You need to multiply each vowel in the string by a specified factor n.\n\nYour task is to implement the function increaseVowels(n, input), where:\n\nn is an integer representing the factor by which the number of vowels in the string should be increased.\ninput is a string in which the number of vowels needs to be increased.\nThe function should return a new string where each vowel in the input string is repeated n times.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf the input string is \"hello world!\" and n is 3, the function should return \"heeellooo woorld\".\nIf the input string is \"programming is fun!\" and n is 2, the function should return \"proogrraammiing iis fuun!\".\nYour solution should handle both uppercase and lowercase vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). Other characters in the string should remain unchanged.\n\nConsider edge cases such as an empty string or a string with no vowels. Ensure your solution is efficient and handles memory allocation properly.\n\nYour function should not modify the original string; instead, it should return a new string with the increased number of vowels.",
