    "description": "Morse Code was a way early telecommunication method. It was a simple translation of alpha numeric characters to a series of short and long signals often described as dot and dashes (. -). This kata will have you take text and transform it to a series of dots and dashes, as well as taking a series of dots and dashes into text.\nSolving this kata can expose you to the various functions in each language such as:\n\nStrings,Arrays,Loops,Regular Expressions,Splitting/Joining/Replacing Strings. \n\n\nBelow are the characters and their associated morse code:\n\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/xMAVxAC\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xMAVxAC.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that morse code does not have separate codes for upper and lower case. For this challenge you should assume all text to be in lower case.\n\nTo clarify both \"(\" and \")\" are the same sequence in morse code \"-.--.-\".\nwhen translating back from morse code to text either will be acceptable.\n\n\n  Arrays/Lists/Hashes/Objects/Sequences for both \"morse code -> character\" and \"character -> morse\" code are preloaded and may be accessed as such:\n\n```python\n  textToMorse[\"a\"]\n  morseToText[\".-\"]\n```\n```if:python\n  In python arrays are created and used like this:\n  \n~~~python\n  myarray={}\n  myarray=[\"a\"] = \"0\"\n  print(myarray[\"a\"]) -> 0\n\n  myarray=[\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"]\n  print(myarray[0]) -> a\n~~~\n```\n```php\n  $textToMorse[\"a\"]\n  $morseToText[\".-\"]\n```\n```if:php\n  In php arrays are created and used like this:\n~~~php  \n  $myarray[\"a\"] = \"0\";\n  print $myarray[\"a\"]; -> 0\n  \n  $myarray = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"];\n  print($myarray[0]); -> \"a\"\n~~~\n```\n```javascript\n  textToMorse[\"a\"]\n  morseToText[\".-\"]\n```\n```if:javascript\n  In javascript objects (one way javascript handles associative arrays)  are created and used like this:\n  \n~~~javascript\n  var obj = {};\n  \n  obj[\"a\"] = 0;\n  return obj[\"a\"] -> 0;\n  \n  or in the case of an actual array\n  \n  myarray = new Array(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\");\n  return myarray[0]; -> \"a\"\n~~~\n```\n```ruby\n  $textToMorse[\"a\"];\n  $morseToText[\".-\"];\n```\n```if:ruby\n  In ruby hashes are created and used like this:\n\n~~~ruby\n  $myhash = Hash.new;\n  $myhash[\"a\"] = \"0\";\n  print $myhash[\"a\"]; -> 0\n  \n  $myhash = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"];\n  print($myhash[0]); -> \"a\"\n~~~\n```",
