    "description": "The year is 2490 BC. It is the fourth dynasty in Ancient Egypt. You are the head of building and innovation for Pharaoh  Khufu. He has asked you to build him the Great Pyramid of Giza. He wants to know how long it will take. \n\nHowever Pharaoh Khufu has made you a deal. The faster you can build the pyramid, the  bigger the bonus he will give you. \n\n\n\n\n\nYour task is to  create a function  (buildPyramidTime) that returns the number of years it will take to build.  \nIn order to calculate the number of years it will take to build the Great Pyramid, you must add two paremeters, (strength) + (skill) . \n\nOnce you know the total number of years via the (buildPyramidTime) function, you must then figure out and (return) what your bonus will be.\n\nThe terms of the deal with Pharaoh Khufu are as follows:\n\nIf you build the Great Pyramid in more than 15 years, your function will return \"receive 3000  gold coins\".\nIf you build the Great Pyramid in 10-15 years , your function will return \"receive  5000 gold coins\".\nIf you build the Great Pyramid in less than 10 years, your function will return \"receive 10000 gold coins\".\n\n\n\n\n",
