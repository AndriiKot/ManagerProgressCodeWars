    "description": "Create a class that constructs meme objects with a name, origin, dankness, and spiciness value. \n```javascript\n  var pepe = new memeMaker(\"Pepe\", \"4chan\", 20, 40);\n```\nYou should create a method called increasedDankness() for the memes that increases the dankness by 10 and returns the dankness level before and after. \n```javascript\npepe.increasedDankness() // => \"Pepe's dankness levels have increased from 20 to 30!\"\n```\nYou should create another method for the meme called deadMeme() that when called sets the meme's dankness to 0, and returns that the meme is dead. \n```javascript\npepe.deadMeme() // => \"This meme is dead! Dankness levels are now at 0!\" \n```\n\nLastly, there should be a method called spicier() that increases the spiciness of the meme by 20. It should also return that the meme became spicier. \n```javascript\n pepe.spicier() // => \"This meme became spicier! Spice levels are now at 60!\"\n```",
