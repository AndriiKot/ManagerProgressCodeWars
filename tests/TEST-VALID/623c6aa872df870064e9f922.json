    "description": "Prove inequality between values is easy. Just use absurd pattern. But how do you prove inequality between types?\n\nIt seems a little trickier, right? Think about it. You can't just use absurd pattern to deduce inequality. Maybe it's better to think how absurd pattern actually work for values in theory? Or think about what will happen if two types are isomorphic but not exactly definitional equal?\n",
