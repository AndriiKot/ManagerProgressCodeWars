    "description": "You're given an int array \"n\". Every element is positive and bigger than 5. They are also consecutive. <br>\nExample of \"n\" : <br> [6,7,8,9,10] <br> [15,16,17,18] <br>\nYou have to turn each element of the array \"n\" to 1 by using the following operations in this order: <br>\n\n\"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"\n\nYou then return a multidimensional int array in which every row contains 4 numbers used to obtain the correct result for every element of the array \"n\". If the row has more or less than 4 numbers, an error will be returned.\n\nYou must not use in a row: <br>\n- Negative numbers <br>\n- 0 <br>\n- Repeats <br>\n- \"n\" <br>\n- Numbers bigger than \"n\" <br>\nTo get \"n\" to 1.\n\nYou also must not have more than 2 matching pairs between 2 consecutive rows no matter where they are positioned in the row.\n\nError Examples:\n\nCase 1: <br>\nn = 6 <br>\n=> ((6 + 0 - 5 )* 1) / 1 = 1 <br>\n1 is repeated, 0 is not allowed. Error!\n\nCase 2: <br>\nn = 6 | Row 1 <br>\n=> ((6 + 1 - 5 )* 2) / 4 = 1\n\nn = 7 | Row 2 <br>\n=> ((7 + 1 - 6 )* 2) / 4 = 1 <br>\n1,2,4 match! More than 2 pairs not allowed! Error!\n\nCorrect Example: (for n = [6,7])\n\nn = 6 <br>\n=> ((6 + 1 - 5 )* 2) / 4 = 1\n\nn = 7 <br>\n=> ((7 + 3 - 4 )* 1) / 6 = 1 <br>\nresult = { [1,5,2,4], [3,4,1,6] } <br>\n(first number is n, the rest of the numbers are part of the solution)\n\nYou can assume that \"n\" is never null and the first element is always > 5.  \nIf the description is unclear or you have found bugs in the code, let me know asap!\n\n\n\n\n",
