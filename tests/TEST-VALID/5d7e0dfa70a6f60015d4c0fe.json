    "description": "You are a student spy tasked to collect information about a secret code called \"Eclipse\", that will lead to an elixir important to achieve your goals. While the teachers will not provide information, there is only one person who has secret files - your nemesis. It is very easy to track them down. The problem for now is to find the cipher sequence.\n\nGOAL:\nGet the pattern of encoding. Will be helpful in future episodes.\n\nNOTE:\nThe further you get into the storyline, the harder the levels get.\n\n",
