    "description": "*This Kata does focus HEAVILY on time complexity, keep that in mind, before reading any further:\n\nTask is to write a method, that does declare what's the highest value the backpacker can take with him on his journey, the tricky part: He can take fractions of every item as needed!\n\nLets say here are the items he can choose from: \n(represented inside a data container, like std::vector<>, or whatever your language does support):\nItem Id: 0,1,2,3;      Size: 22,10,9,7;        Value: 19,9,9,6;\n\nindex [0] is the itemId, index [1] the size, as well as index [2] the value, stored as a 2D data container, so we can have multiples ones of those inside the outer data container!\nIf the backpack has only empty data containers -> return a '0' as a result!\n\nThe 2nd argument inside the method will be the maximum size the backpack has, lets say it's '25' for this example:\nThis will return a result of '23.1818', as due to the items 1,2 & 3 we're added, however only a fraction of item 3 and then it's corresponding value, based on how many % of it did fit inside the backpack!\n\nThat is the highest possible value, which you can achieve with packing your backpack, happy journey traveler! :)\n\nIMPORTANT: Every item can just be added ONCE, NOT multiple times, except it's also multiples times inside the data container!\n\nGeneral note: There are 5 test cases that you can see and check on and a bunch of randomly generated ones!\nHappy Coding!",
