    "description": "You probably know how to make a random (pseudorandom) number in Javascript, right? Wrong! In this kata, `Math` methods are disabled. You must write your own function to return a new random number on repeated calls. The number should be between 0 and 1.\n\nYour function does not need to be as good as `Math.random()` but it should come pretty close. It also needs to be efficient, or the test will timeout. \n\n#### Testing\n\nThe final test estimates a value using a [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method), where the randomness is provided by your function. It fails if the estimate is not within expected bounds. Note that because the test is statistical, sometimes it will just fail through bad luck but the odds of that happening twice with a working algorithm are very low, so just try again.\n\n\n",
