    "description": "<h2 style=\"color:#4bd4de\">Problem description</h2>\nAnything in our world could be turned into a black hole! Even you. All it takes is to compress all of your mass into a tiny little dot in space, so tiny that it's enough to create a miniscule black hole. But how tiny is it? That's the question Schwarzschild Radius formula answers.\n\nSuch radius (in meters) is evaluated using the following formula:\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6whZWvl.png\" width=\"117\" height=\"62\">\n\nWhere `G` is the gravitational constant, `6.6743 × 10**-11` for our purposes\n\n`M` is the mass of the object in kilograms.\n\n`c` is the speed of light in m/s, `299792458 m/s` for our purposes\n\n<h2 style=\"color:#62d941\">Your task</h2>\n\nImplement a function `schwarzschild(mass)` that takes object's mass in kilograms and outputs its Schwarzschild Radius, so that we know how much of compression we need in order to create a black hole from it.\n\n<h2 style=\"color:#62d941\">Notes</h2>\n\nThere are 100 random tests.\n\nThere will be no negative mass inputs (all inputs are valid)\n\nYour answer should be accurate at least to the seventh digit after comma (for actual answer of `0.12345678`, `0.12345671` is allowed, but `0.12345660` is not)",
