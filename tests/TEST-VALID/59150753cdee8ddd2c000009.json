    "description": "Tim the timber man just finished cutting all his logs. He has n logs (each of which are marked 1, 2, 3... n) and he was wondering how he could order his logs for shipping. He ships in packages of k logs.\n\nCreate a program that given a number of logs (n) and a package size (k) will return the ways Tim can order his logs. Your program should return an array of arrays.\n\nExample:\nWith 5 logs and a package size of 3 your program should return\n[[1,2,3],[1,2,4],[1,2,5],[1,3,4],[1,3,5],[1,4,5],[2,3,4],[2,3,5],[2,4,5],[3,4,5]]",
