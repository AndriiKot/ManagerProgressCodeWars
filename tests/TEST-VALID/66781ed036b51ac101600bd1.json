    "description": "Bob is a very busy teacher and it's time to finalize the grades. He already has the names and grades of his students and, being a fan of exploration, he wants to store them **in a map**.\n\nBob only wants to create a list of students who **have passed** his subject. **(Passing means getting a score between 5 and 10, inclusive)**.\n\nIn the provided lists, **the names will always be valid values** and for simplicity, the **grades are integer values**.\n\n**IMPORTANT**, if a student's name appears more than once, only the first occurrence will be stored in the map.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```\nnames = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"Diana\"}, grades = {5, 12, 7, 3} -> {\"Alice\" -> 5, \"Charlie\" -> 7}\n```\n\n\n",
