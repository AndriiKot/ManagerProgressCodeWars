    "description": "THIS IS NOT TO BE USED FOR ACTUAL INVESTING DECISIONS. TALK TO A FINANCIAL ADVISOR BEFORE INVESTING.\n\nIf you are into investing, something that comes up is when to buy?\n\nAs the old saying goes, buy low and sell high. Much easier said than done.\nIn this world I would like to feed you information and get a recommendation on if I should buy.\n\nUpdate \"shouldIBuy\" so that when given the number of shares already owned, the total amount it cost to buy those shares previously and the current price a true or false is returned. If the current price is less than (exclusive) the average cost per share then, return true.",
