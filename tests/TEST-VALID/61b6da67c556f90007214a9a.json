    "description": "This kata is much complicated but not that hard. You need to work on how to read description properly instead of your programming skills. Because in real world we need to completely understand how the description that client gave to us. So this kata will need you to be having more attention to the Description>\n\nKata Explanation : \n-                     \"First Second\"\n-          First       ->  You need to encrypt this\n-          Second      ->  You need to decrypt this\n\nBoundaries : \n- One string, only gave you 2 sentence only. \n- If more than 2 sentences, return \"error\". \n- If one string have only 1 sentence it will be encrypt only. \n- If string doesnt have sentence it will return \"empty\"\n- Every sentences in One String MUST have 1 big uppercase not less and not more. MUST ONE. Instead it will return \"error\"\n\nGiven Example : \n1. ex : \"Iam oehnSmtig\" -> \"aIm Something\"\n2. ex : \"Together\" -> \"oehrTgte\"\n3. ex : \"\" -> \"empty\"\n4. ex : \"I am oehnSmtig\" -> \"error\"\n5. ex : \"SomeThing Babe\" -> \"error\"\n6. ex : \"Something babe\" -> \"error\"\n\nEncrypt Algorithm :\n-           (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) \n-            S   o   m   e   t   h   i   n   g\n-                          TO\n-           (2) (4) (6) (8) (1) (3) (5) (7) (9)\n-            o   e   h   n   S   m   t   i   g\n \nDecrypt Algorithm :\n-               Think by yourselves :DD",
