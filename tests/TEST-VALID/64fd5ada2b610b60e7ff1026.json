    "description": "### Task\nImagine you're given a test score that, if added to the class's scores, would decrease the class average by a certain percentage. Your task is to calculate the percentage score you can achieve on the test while achieving this decrease in the class average. \n\nThe input consists of a list of your classmates' scores `lst` and the desired percentage decrease in the class average `x`. Your goal is to create a function that calculates and returns the desired percentage, rounded to the nearest percent.\n\n### Examples\n```\nlst: [\"95%\", \"83%\", \"90%\", \"87%\", \"88%\", \"93%\"]\nx = \"5%\"\n#output = \"54%\". \n#This means you need to score 54% on the test to achieve the desired decrease in the class average.\n\nlst: [\"10%\"]\nx = \"5%\"\n#output = \"0%\". \n# you have to score \"0%\" to bring down the class average by 5%.\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- The input will not include empty lists, and the desired decrease will always be a non-negative percentage.\n- Ensure that your function returns a string representing the rounded result, as required by the task.",
