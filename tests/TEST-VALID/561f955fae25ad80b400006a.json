    "description": "Based on the [Smale horseshoe map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_map).\n\n#### Summary\n\nReturn the number of cycles of the binary representation of an integer under the `fold and squash` mapping (defined below).\n\n#### Details\n\nThe `fold and squash` map is defined as the following transformation of a binary pattern:\n\n1. Take a binary pattern and split it in half (add a `0` to the beginning if there are an odd number of digits).\n```\n11001001 --> (1100, 1001)\n```\n\n2. Fold the first half back onto the second half as follows (remember that folding it back reverses the order):\n```\n0011\n1001\n```\n\n3. Squash the two parts together, with the upper digits occupying the place to the left of the lower digits, as follows:\n```\n01001011\n```\nAt the end of every iteration, you should have the same number of bits as you started with; in other words, do not remove leading zeros.\n\nThe **number of cycles** is defined as the number of iterations of this map that are required to return to the original binary representation. For example the number of cycles of `11001001` is `4`:\n```\nStart  bits: 11001001\nIteration 1: 01001011\nIteration 2: 01001101\nIteration 3: 01011001\nIteration 4: 11001001\n```\n\nWrite a function that takes an integer as an input and returns the number of cycles of the binary representation under this map.\n```\ncycles(201) -> 4\n```\n\nAll inputs will be positive integers.",
