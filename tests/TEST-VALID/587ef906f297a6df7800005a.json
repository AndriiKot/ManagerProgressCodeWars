    "description": "# Phone Number\n\nWrite a program that cleans up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n- If the phone number is less than 10 digits assume that it is bad\n  number\n- If the phone number is 10 digits assume that it is good\n- If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is 1, trim the 1\n  and use the last 10 digits\n- If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is not 1, then\n  it is a bad number\n- If the phone number is more than 11 digits assume that it is a bad\n  number\n\nYou are provided with a class `Phone` which has following methods:\n\n1. number\nReturns the number that is initialized if the number is valid, following above rules\n\n``` python\nnumber = Phone(\"(123) 456-7890\").number\n\"1234567890\"\n```\n\nThis should return \"0000000000\" if the number is invalid.\n\n2. area_code\n\nReturns an area code from the number. The area code will be 3 digits\n\n``` python\nnumber = Phone(\"1234567890\")\nnumber.area_code()\n\"123\"\n```\nThis should be returned as a string.\n\n3. pretty\n\nReturns a neat format of the number with the area code in brackets.\n\n``` python\nnumber = Phone(\"1234567890\")\nnumber.pretty()\n\"(123) 456-7890\"\n```\n\n## Source\n\nEvent Manager by JumpstartLab [http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html)\n",
