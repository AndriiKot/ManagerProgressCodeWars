    "description": "You are given a string which contains a string with numbers, and there is some symbol between two numbers. Your goal is to make a ```factorial_sum()``` function that will return sum of factorials of the numbers in the string. Return zero if there is only a single letter that isn't number.\n\nExample:\n```\n\"5L4L2L11\" --> 5 4 2 11 > 5! + 4! + 2! + 11! = 39916946\n```\n\nHelpful info: It's guaranteed that the string will have at least 1 letter and less than 15 numbers and that the numbers wont be higher than 20 (21 or higher takes time to calculate). Factorial is a number multiplied by all previous numbers. For example: factorial of 5, which is written like 5! will equal to 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120. 0! is considered 1. Symbols between numbers will be singular letters (a-z) and (A-Z).\n\n\n",
