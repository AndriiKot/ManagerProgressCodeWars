    "description": "All natural numbers are either happy or sad. \n\nA happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits in base-ten, and repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1. \n\nThose numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are sad numbers.\n\nSome people call such a cycle an unhappy family of numbers.\n\nAnyway, your task is to determine whether a given number is happy or sad.\n\nIf the number is happy return the string \":D\".\n\nIf the number is sad return the string \":(\".",
