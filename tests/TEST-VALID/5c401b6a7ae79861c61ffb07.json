    "description": "The Caesar shift is an ancient and very simple encryption method where each letter is substituted by another letter some fixed distance in the alphabet. For instance, `Julius Caesar` would be rewritten as `KVMJVTDBFTBS` with a shift of 1, as `ITKHTRBZDRZQ` with a shift of -1, or as `WHYVHFPNRFNE` with a shift of 13.\n\nYour code will recieve a string encrypted with the Caesar shift. The number of letters shifted is not provided. Your job is to determine the original sentence or similar excerpt, which is written in English and taken from a classic text. For instance, given:\n\n```\nBWHYVHFPNRFNEGUBHNEGZVTUGLLRGGULFCVEVGJNYXFNOEBNQNAQGHEAFBHEFJBEQFVABHEBJACEBCRERAGENVYF\n```\n\nyour program should return:\n\n```json\nOJULIUSCAESARTHOUARTMIGHTYYETTHYSPIRITWALKSABROADANDTURNSOURSWORDSINOUROWNPROPERENTRAILS\n```\n\n_O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet! Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords in our own proper entrails._\n\nSorry, there will be no spacing or punctuation to establish word boundaries. Best of luck! `:~)`\n",
