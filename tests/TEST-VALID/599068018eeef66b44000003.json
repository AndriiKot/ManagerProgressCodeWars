    "description": "Your friend got hold of some series that has a non-divergent infinite sum. Now he's given you a challenge: Providing the first `16` terms of a series, figure out its infinite sum as accurate as possible (with an relative error of less than `10^-5`).\n\nNote: Sometimes fixed test case can fail, though if your solution is correct, it should happen very rarely. In fact, you should be able to get accuracy up to `10^-6` consistently.\n\n---\n\nNeed a hint? Here is one (highlight the following text to see it):\n\n<div style=\"background-color:grey\"><font color=\"grey\">The series are not converging fast enough. There are techniques to make that happen faster ;-)</font></div>",
