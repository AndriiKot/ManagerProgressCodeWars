    "description": "A squarefree number is an integer which is divisible by no perfect square other than `1`.\n\nSo, `20` is not a squarefree number because is divisible by 4 (`4 = 2*2`, a perfect square). But `30` is one of them.\n\nYour task is, given a certain number `n`, output, if possible, the **lowest squarefree integer multiple of n**, let's name it `lsm`.\n\nExamples:\n```\nn = 10\nlsm = 30\n\nn = 39\nlsm = 78\n\nn = 156\nlsm, it doesn't exist, beacause, 156 isn't a square free number.\n```\nMore examples in the example box, see the name of the function and the corresponding output when n is not a square free number.\n\nFeatures of the random tests:\n```\n2 <= n <= 1 e14 (with n squarefree or not)\n2 <= n <= 1 e249 (with n always squarefree)\n```\n",
