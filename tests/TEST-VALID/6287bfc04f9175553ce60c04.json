    "description": "<h2>Convert a number into a reversed tuple of digits</h2>\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"500\" size=\"2\" color=\"#777\" />\n\nIn this kata you have to simply convert a non-negative integer number into a reversed tuple of its digits.\n\n`td(123)` should equal `(3, 2, 1)`\n\nHowever, the restrictions are very tight!\n\nLength of your code should not exceed `37` symbols.\n\nYou're not allowed to use \";\" symbol (in python), therefore, your solution must have only one statement.\n\nAnd, obviously, you're limited with `1` line of code.\n\nFor your awareness, simple `td = lambda n: tuple(reversed([int(x) for x in str(n)]))` is almost twice as long, as you're allowed to.\n\n<h2>Good luck!</h2>",
