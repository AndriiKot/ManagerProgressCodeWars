    "description": "In a video game called Dota 2, a character has two defensive attributes:\n\n- [int] Health points\n- [int] Armor\n\nThe player earns gold and spends it to improve the endurance of his hero. Other characters can attack the player and deal physical damage to him with their weapons.\n\nEach point of armor reduces the incoming physical damage by 6%.\n\nFor skilled players, when buying new items, it is important to know which attribute to choose to increase their Effective Health Pool. Your task is to create a function that returns Effective Health Pool.\n\nRead more here: http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Armor\n\n<b>Important</b>: Heroes can have negative armor. \n\n<b>Important #2</b>: Floor the result.\n",
