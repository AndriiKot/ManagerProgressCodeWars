    "description": "Find the shared words between 2 pieces of text.\n\nWrite a function called sharedWords that takes 2 strings and returns an array of the words that are shared between them.\n\nA few things to note:\n\n- The shared words should be returned in alphabetical order.\n- The shared words should be returned in all lower case.\n- Each shared word should only appear once in the returned array.\n- The only puntuation that should appear within the shared words are hyphens ( - ) and apostophes ( ' ).\n- Words with hyphens or apostrophes are considered different words to similar words without those punctuation marks. E.g., coders, coder's and coders' would all be considered different words and e-mail and email would be considered different words.\n- Words that are abbreviated with a full stop should be compared and returned without the full stop. If one string contained \"Dr.\" and the other contained \"Dr\" then \"dr\" should be returned as a shared word.\n- Shared words should be words and not numbers. \"1\" should be ignored but \"one\" shouldn't be.\n- There won't be any double punctuation like \"What?!\" or \"HELP!!!\".\n\nGot all that? Good! Have fun!",
