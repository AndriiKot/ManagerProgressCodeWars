    "description": "You are on a team which must create a robotic version of yoda for a convention. The robot will use text to speech, and you are tasked with creating a function which, when given a basic english sentence (in the order subject, verb, object), will return a yoda-like sentence (in the order object, subject, verb).\n\n```\nExamples:\n\"You have much to learn\" >> \"Much to learn, you have\"\n\"You must follow me\" >> \"Follow me, you must\"\n```\n\nIf you are not good at English, as I am (even as a native speaker). You might find it helpful to review the structure of sentences in the link below.\n\n(https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/writingcenter/grammar/sentencestructure)\n\nKeep in mind that this website mentions prepositional phrases, which for the purpose of this, can be said to be included in the object.\n```\"Spaghetti for dinner, I like\"```\n\n\n\n**What It Will Do**\n\n* Return a yoda-orded *simple* english sentence\n\nThe only subjects (of the sentence) that will be used are as follows:\n```subjects = [\"i\", \"you\", \"he\", \"she\", \"they\", \"yoda\", \"luke\"]```\n\nNOTE words such as \"me\" or \"them\" MAY be present in the sentence, but will NOT be used as the subject\nSuch as in the example :\n      \"You must follow **me**\" >> \"Follow **me**, you must\"\n\nThe only verbs present are as follows:\n```verbs = [\"have\", \"must\", \"are\", \"is\", 'will', 'needs', 'need']```\n\n**The verbs and subjects will be preloaded in the kata\n**They are lists, named as they appear above; You DO NOT have to type them yourself\n\n* Place a comma following the object of the sentence\n\nSuch as in the example :\n      \"You must follow me\" >> \"Follow me **,** you must\"\n\n\n**What It Wont Do**\n\n* Work with sentence structures other than a simple sentence\n\n* Use verbs / subjects other than what is provided\n\n\n**I appreciate any feedback that you may provide in the discussion, have fun!!**",
