    "description": "# Introduction\n\nA common task in programming is to find an element from some data set. To do this, the C++ STL provides us with the algorithm `std::find`. It works in O(n) and works well with `std::vector`, `std::deque` and `std::list`. \nIt also works with `std::set`. But since the data in `std::set` is usually stored as a binary search tree we should be able to do better than O(n) and so `std::set` has a member function that does a binary search in O(log(n)).\n\n# Your Task\n\nYour task is to write a generic find-function that makes the decision wether to use the find-algorithm or a find-member-function. Your function should also work with non-standard containers as long as they provide a find function taking only a key value as an argument. \nThis means that overloading is not a sufficient solution.\n\n### Notes:\n - The test cases will use this `find` function as if the member function was called. E.g. for `std::string` the test cases expect an integer value instead of an iterator. If done right this won't be an additional difficulty for the solution.\n - I implemented a [flat_set](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/doc/html/container/non_standard_containers.html#container.non_standard_containers.flat_xxx) container where I omitted the `begin`/`end` member functions. So this test case will only compile if done right.",
