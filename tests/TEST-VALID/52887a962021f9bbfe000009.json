    "description": "Write a method that calculates the number of IPv6 addresses between two given IPv6 addresses, excluding the end IP address.\n\nAll input to the `ipv6_between` method will be two valid IPv6 addresses in the form of a `String`.  The last address will always be equal to or at least one address higher than the first one.  The method should also be case-insensitive.\n\n**Examples:**\n```ruby\nipv6_between(\"fe80::1\", \"fe80::2\") # => 1\nipv6_between(\"FE80:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001\", \"FE80:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0002\") # => 1\n```\n\n**Note:** Make sure your solution accounts for leading zeros, groups of zeros, and dotted-quad notation as described here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address",
