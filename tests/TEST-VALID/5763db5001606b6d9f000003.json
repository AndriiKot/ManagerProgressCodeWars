    "description": "You love to gamble... and it's UEFA 2016 football tournament.\n\nThe bookmakers are in it to make money right. They do this by reducing the true odds which causes the 'book' to exceed 100%, this is known as the 'bookmakers margin'. It represents their expected profits and is the amount the book exceeds 100%. The book is the sum of all relative probabilities. Mathematically, in 'real life', the sum of probabilities for all possibilities must be 1.00 or 100%.\n\nIf you can work out which bookmakers is running at a smaller bookmakers margin, you'll know who's offering better odds (closer to the true odds) and where you're more likely to make £££!\n\n##Task\n\nThe 3-Way odds are provided in 2D arrays with the bookmakers name. Return a single array containing the bookmaker with smallest margin and the margin itself as a percentage (rounded to the nearest integer).\n\n```javascript\ninput:              [ [\"BookmakerA\", [oddsHome, oddsDraw, oddsAaway] ]\nEg:      var arrA = [\"Villiam Hill\", [4/6, 6/4, 4/1] ]\n         var arrB = [\"Noddy Power\", [3/5, 7/5, 19/5] ]\n         \noutput:             [\"BookmakerA\", bookmakersMargin]\nEg:                 [\"Villiam Hill\", \"20%\"]\n```\n##Tip\n\nYou'll have to get familiar with the relationship between probabilities and odds, they are similar but not the same! http://pages.uoregon.edu/aarong/teaching/G4075_Outline/node15.html\n",
