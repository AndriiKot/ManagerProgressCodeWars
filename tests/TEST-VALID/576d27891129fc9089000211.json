    "description": "If you liked or hated \"Performance #2 - Fill an Int-Array - Need High Speed\", this will be more difficult!\nIts recommended to do \"Performance #2 - Fill an Int-Array - Need High Speed\" before you try this kata.\n\nYou have to fill an int Array with numbers from 0 to 3999999\n\nThe numbers have to be in ascending order.\n\nBut there is a problem. You have to do this very very very very quick.\n\nFor better time measurement, now there are 500 runs of the test method!\n(Also the allowed time will be always calculated on the fly.)\n\nIn \"Performance #2 - Fill an Int-Array - Need High Speed\" you wrote fast code, but now maybe it's not fast enough!\nToo fast for you?\n\nHint: Think about the Description of the test... ;-) The test must be completed quick!",
