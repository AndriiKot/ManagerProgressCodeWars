    "description": "Elementary Cellular Automata - Part 1<br />\n\nIn this Kata you will take a first step to help work with very basic Cellular Automata.<br />\n\nThese articles explain the concepts of Cellular Automata.<br />\nhttp://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html<br />\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton#Elementary_cellular_automata<br />\n\nIn particular for this Kata you should see how rules are classified and how to determine a cell state based on its neighbors. For now we won't even worry about iterating generations.<br />\n\nThis first step is simple.<br />\nYour function will return the state that a cell will take based on a given nearest neighbors pattern and a given rule.<br />\n\nThe two possible states of the returned cell are represented by '0' and '1'. <br />\nThe pattern of neighbors is represented as a string. For example \"101\".<br />\nThe rule is represented by an integer. For example 188.<br />\n\nThe input pattern will always be 3 characters long and contain only '0's and '1's.<br />\nThe rule will always be a value 0 to 255.<br />\n\nExample:\nGiven a neighbor pattern of \"101\" and given rule 30, return '0'.<br />\nGiven a neighbor pattern of \"101\" and given rule 188, return '1'.<br />\nGiven a neighbor pattern of \"111\" and given rule 102, return '0'.<br />",
