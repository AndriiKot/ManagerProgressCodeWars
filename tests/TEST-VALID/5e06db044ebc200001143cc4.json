    "description": "Write a program that will calculate the number of trailing zeros in double factorial of a given number.\n\nFor an integer n not less than 0, let us define f(n) follows:\n```\nf(n) = 1 if (n<2)\nf(n) = nf(n-2) if (n≥2)\n```\n\nHere's two examples to get you started:\n```\ntrailing_zeros(12) == 1\n#f(12) = 12 * 10 * 8 * 6 * 4 * 2 = 46080, which has 1 zero at the end\n\ntrailing_zeros(5) == 0\n#f(5) = 5 * 3 * 1 = 15, which has no trailing zeros at the end\n```\nYour code should be able to handle some very large numbers, so write some smart code.\n\nNote: ```0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 ```\n\nHint: You're not meant to calculate the factorial. Find another way to find the number of zeros.\n",
