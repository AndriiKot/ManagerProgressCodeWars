    "description": "You are tasked with creating a function that generates a dictionary of student scores based on provided data. The function takes a list of students and their corresponding scores, along with a list of subject titles. It then constructs a dictionary where the first key is 'Names' and its value is a list of student names, followed by keys for each subject where the values are lists containing the scores of each student for that subject.\n\nFor this Kata, you need to implement the generate_scores_dict function. The function should accept two arguments:\n\nstudents: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the name of the student followed by their scores for each subject.\nsubjects: A list of strings representing the titles of subjects.\nThe function should return a dictionary where the keys are the subject titles and the values are lists containing the scores of each student for that subject. Additionally, it should include a key 'Names' whose value is a list of student names in the same order as the input.\n\nFor example:\nA sample input will be:\n\n```\nstudents = [(\"Alice\", 90, 85, 95), (\"Bob\", 88, 92, 87), (\"Charlie\", 78, 85, 80)]\nsubjects = [\"Math\", \"Science\", \"English\"]\ngenerate_scores_dict(students, subjects)\n\n```\nThe output should be:\n\n```\n{\n    'Names': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],\n    'Math': [90, 88, 78],\n    'Science': [85, 92, 85],\n    'English': [95, 87, 80]\n}\n\n```\n\n\nComplete the Kata and aim for efficiency and readability in your solution.",
