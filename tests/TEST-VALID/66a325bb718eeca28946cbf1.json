    "description": "# Problem: Date Generator\n## Write a function dateGenerator(mode, dateFrom, dateTo, daysOfWeek, nthWeek) that generates dates based on the following modes:\n1. Every Day Mode: If mode is 1, the function should return all dates from dateFrom to dateTo.\n2. Weekly Day Mode: If mode is 2, the function should return dates that fall on the specified daysOfWeek within the range from dateFrom to dateTo.\n3. Monthly Nth Week Day Mode: If mode is 3, the function should return dates that fall on the specified daysOfWeek and also fall on the nthWeek of every month within the range from dateFrom to dateTo.\n\n## The parameters are as follows:\n\n* mode: An integer (1, 2, or 3) representing the mode of operation.\n* dateFrom and dateTo: Strings representing the start and end dates for the range to consider. The dates are in the format “YYYY-MM-DD”.\n* daysOfWeek: An array of integers representing the days of the week to consider (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.). This parameter is used in modes 2 and 3.\n* nthWeek: An integer representing the nth week of the month to consider. This parameter is used in mode 3.\n\nThe function should return an array of strings representing the dates that meet the specified criteria. Each date should be in the format “YYYY-MM-DD”.\n\n## Note\n- None of the parameters should be validated as null or empty, so don't mind it.\n- If dateFrom is greater than dateTo remember to swap them back.",
