    "description": "Your goal here is to make a Regex that will match all the [significant figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures) in a number, that is all.\n\nThe rules are:\n\n- All non-zero digits are significant figures\n- If the value of the given number is 0, there are 0 significant figures \n- If the given number has a decimal point, all digits after the first non-zero digit is significant\n- If the given number does not have a decimal point, trailing 0's are not significant\n- There are no leading 0's\n- A given number can start with a dot\n- If there are match groups in your Regex, only the matched groups will be considered part of the match, and the rest of the match will be ignored.\n- It does not need to match all of the significant figures in a single match",
