    "description": "You own a great car website that helps people make decisions about buying the best new car for them. You decide that if you had a calculator on the website which lets people know their car's value after depreciation in a couple of years, would be a great idea!\n\nWrite a function that takes the car's value when new (p) and return its value to 2 decimal places in the nth year (n), where n is always greater than 0.\n\nYearly depreciation:\n\nYear 1 = 20%\n\nYear 2 = 20%\n\nYear 3+ = 10% per year (ie. after 3 years the cars value depreciates 10% every year)\n\nReturn your answer as a string with 2 decimal places. \n",
