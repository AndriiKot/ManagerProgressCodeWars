    "description": "In music on the planet nubulax, there are eight notes in each octave of a scale. This is how they look on a piano as 'white notes':\n\n                   \"G\" \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"D\" \"E\" \"F\" \"G\"\n\nEach DIFFERENT note has it's own SHARP (#).\n\nSharps must be ordered to any scale in the following pattern:\n\n                    F# C# G# D# A# E# B#\n\nIt's possible to work out which sharps are in a major scale from its root (the first note of the scale) using these three steps:\n\n- Decide which is the first note of your scale (e.g. E).\n- On a piano, find the note immediately below the root (in this case D).\n- Using the sharp pattern, count up to (and including) D.\n\nThe above example shows that E major has 4 sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#.\n\nDesign a function that takes any root note and returns the corresponding number of sharps in an array.\n\n````\n\"E\" --> should return [\"F#\", \"C#\", \"G#\", \"D#\"]\n````\nThe exception to this rule is C major, which has no sharps at all. If root C is entered, the function should return \"no sharps\".\n````\n\"C\" --> should return \"no sharps\"\n````\nThe function should return \"undefined note\" if the taken object is anything other than one of the the seven capitalised 'white notes' on the piano.\n`````\n\"fkuy8\" --> should return \"undefined note\"\n`````\n",
