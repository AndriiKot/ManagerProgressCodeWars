    "description": "You are a professor in high school. Summer holidays are over and you have been given many different lists containing your new students' names. It's your responsability to put all these lists together, in ascending order in the alphabet, so you can get organized in a more efficient way.\n\nAs a computer programmer in your free time, you decided to write a program that would do what you need.\n\nYour task\n========\n\nGiven multiple arrays, to the function `organize`, return a single one with all the values of the previous arrays in `ascending order in the alphabet`.\n\nExample:\n```\norganize([\"Luis\", \"Ana\", \"Josh\"]);\n// [\"Ana\", \"Josh\", \"Luis\"]\n```\nGood luck :)",
