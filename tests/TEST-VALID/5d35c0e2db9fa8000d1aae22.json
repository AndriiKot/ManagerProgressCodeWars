    "description": "You are the owner of a local printing press. You want to calculate how much it'll cost to print an entry in your newspaper. You've figured out that printing each character costs the following:\n\n- a : $0.04\n- b : $0.03\n- c : $0.02\n- d : $0.03\n- e : $0.04\n- f : $0.03\n- g : $0.03\n- h : $0.02\n- i : $0.01\n- j : $0.03\n- k : $0.05\n- l : $0.01\n- m : $0.06\n- n : $0.03\n- o : $0.02\n- p : $0.03\n- q : $0.04\n- r : $0.03\n- s : $0.02\n- t : $0.02\n- u : $0.03\n- v : $0.02\n- w : $0.05\n- x : $0.04\n- y : $0.03\n- z : $0.02\n- ! : $0.02\n- ? : $0.03\n- . : $0.01\n- , : $0.01\n\nYour function should take a string of these characters as an input, and return the total cost of printing. The result must also be a string, formatted in proper currency notation as ```'$x.xx'```. You can also assume the following:\n\n- The input string won't contain any characters not listed above.\n- Capital letters cost twice as much as their lowercase counterparts.\n- Spaces do not cost anything to print.\n- There should only be 1 leading zero for cost values below ```'$1.00'```. For example ```'$00.46'``` or ```'$.46'``` would be examples of incorrect results. In this case, your function should return ```'$0.46'```.\n\n\nSimple Example:\n\n```\"Abc\"``` should return ```'$0.13'``` because ```2*$0.04 + $0.03 + $0.02``` is equal to ```'$0.13'```.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n",
