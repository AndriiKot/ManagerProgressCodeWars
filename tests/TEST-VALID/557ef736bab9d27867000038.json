    "description": "#Preview\n\nJames just started working at a Venture Capital fund. One of the promising investments the fund is currently evaluating is a strongly growing e-commerce startup in Ireland. The team seems to be very ambitions and the market niche is great. <br>\nIn order to make sure the investment will be profitable the fund wants James to create a forecast of future revenues and a potential valuation.\nJames is currently requesting more detailed information about past revenues and investigating the appropriate multiple for the company's market niche.<br>\nCan you help him create a revenue and valuation forecast?\n\n#Problem\n\nHelp James by developing a forecast of revenues the startup will reach in 5 years. Calculate the valuation with the given revenue multiple and indicate if it will potentially exceed 50 Million (the amount the fund needs to justify their investment for 10% of the company).<br>\nPast revenues will be passed on to the function as an array of revenues (in thousands) for the last 5 years and the multiple as a float in the following form:\n```javascript\nrev = [46, 148, 576, 954, 2242]\nmultiple = 4.3\n```\nFuture revenues are expected to develop linearly.<br>\nThe solution is supposed to be passed as a string indicating if the revenues and valuation in year 10 will be enough (valuation of over 50 million) in the following form:\n```javascript\n'The revenue multiple valuation in year 10 will be below the required value at 19.06 million for 4.43 million of revenues in year 10.'\n```\n\n##Hint\nLooking up the formulas for linear regression might help to forecast the revenues.",
