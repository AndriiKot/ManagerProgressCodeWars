    "description": "You are a composer - everyone else is using 12-tone equal temperament, which is so passé. So you decide to explore other equal temperaments. The problem? You've lost all of the papers with your intervals, leaving you in a temper!\n\n# Challenge\nCreate a program which returns all the interval coefficients between 1 and 2, inclusive, for `n`-tone equal temperament.\n\n\n# Important definition\nEqual temperament is a system of creating pitches between a given note and the octave above (with 2x the frequency of the given note). In this kata, the intervals given in the arrays represent the coefficients required to get from a given note to the note n intervals above it.\n\nGiven `n`-tone equal temperament:\n\n`pitch * coefficient = new_pitch` \n\nwhere `coefficient` in `[1, 2^(1/n), 2^(2/n), ..., 2^(n-1/n) , 2]`\n\n# Things to note\n`n` will always be a positive, non-zero integer\n\nReference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament",
