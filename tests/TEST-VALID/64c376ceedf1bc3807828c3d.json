    "description": "For pepople who are new in Minecraft, a sculk sensor is a block which detects vibrations caused by actions and events in a radius **8** around it and emits a redstone signal, and, if it was triggered by a player, also activates nearby sculk shriekers.\\\nA example below showcasing its radius: (Credit: Reddit)\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://preview.redd.it/844l8u6udw261.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=434fb5c1925437ecdbdee37543b7c61a59da412f\" width=\"50%\">\nIn other words, sculk sensor detects player action in a radius of **8** and if there are any sculk shriekers in a radius of **8** again, transport the signal to them.\\\nWarden spawns near a sculk shrieker when either a player stands on it or triggered by sculk sensor for **3** times.\\\nNote: Neglect cooldown.\\\nWrite a code to determine if warden spawns.\\\n#### Input:\nA n\\*n 2D array will be given to you, where `8 <= n <= 100`. `0` represents nothing in that block. `1` represents sculk sensor. `2` represents sculk shrieker.\\\nThen is an array of player action on a specific block that triggers sculk sensors in a radius of 8, or trigger a warden spawn directly if it is on a sculk shrieker.\\\n#### Output:\nReturn `True` if warden spawns, else return `False`.\n#### Note:\n**(x, y) in matrix is not the same as [x][y] in programming**",
