    "description": "My friend, a tennis beginner, asked me once annoyed: how can I really know which side to serve?\n\nIn tennis there is a legacy counting system that is quite irregular. It's not easy to find a pattern in it for a beginner.\n\nThe rules go as follows:\n- each game begins with serve on the left side at the state 0:0 (let's write it [0, 0]).\n- after each point the side changes until the game is over.\n\nWe want to write a simple code that will answer the question: Is it left side to serve? When it's the left side, the anwser is true. When it's the right side, the answer is false.\n\nWrite a function called `serveOnLeft` that will accept a score argument. The problem is we need to answer the question: \"Should I serve on the left side?\" basing on current score.\n\nThe scores for each player can be:\n0, 15, 30, 40. \nThere are also 3 situations to consider: \"advantage in\", \"advantage out\" and \"deuce\".\n\n\"Advantage\" comes when a player is one point forward after 40:40. 40:40 is also called \"deuce\". When the player loses next point after having advantate, the result goes back to \"deuce\", the game ends after winning the point and a new game starts with 0:0.\n\nExamples:\nIn case of 0:0 serve on the left side (true)\nIn case of 30:40 serve on the right side (false)\nIn case of \"deuce\" or in other words 40:40 it's the left side to serve (true).\n\nThe player who has at least 40 points and gets the second point of advantage wins the game. When the last result is 40:40 it's \"deuce\". When the serving player has advantage it's called \"advantage in\" and when the opponent \"advantage out\". For more details about the tennis scoring system check: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system\n\nThe input is an array of two numbers representing points of each player or a string.\n\nThe string might be \"deuce\", \"advantage in\" or \"advantage out\". \n\nAnd yes, there is a finite number of possible results.\nYou can brute force the solution, but it's more fun in trying to find a pattern.\n\nGood luck!",
