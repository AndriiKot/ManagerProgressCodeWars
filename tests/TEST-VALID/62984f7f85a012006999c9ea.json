    "description": "## Story\nTwo consecutive integers a and b are considered a Ruth-Aaron pair if the sum of the prime factors of **`a` is equal to the sum of the prime factors of `b`**.\n\n### First Definition:\n\nSumming up **distinct prime factors**. For example, 24 and 25 constitute a Ruth-Aaron pair by this definition. 8 and 9 do not.\n```\nP24 = [2, 3]  # sum = 5\n\nP25 = [5]  # sum = 5, equal to 24\n\nP8 = [2]  # sum = 2\n\nP9 = [3]  # sum = 3\n```\n### Second Definition:\n\nSumming up **repeated prime factors**. By this definition, 24 and 25 do not constitute a Ruth-Aaron pair. But 8 and 9 do.\n```\nP24 = [2, 2, 2, 3]  # sum = 9\n\nP25 = [5, 5]  # sum = 10\n\nP8 = [2, 2, 2]  # sum = 6\n\nP9 = [3, 3]  # sum = 6, equal to 8\n```\n\n### Third Definition:\n\nIf two consecutive numbers have only distinct prime factors and have equal sums of prime factors, they are considered Ruth-Aaron pairs by both definitions.\n```\nP77 = [7, 11]  # sum = 18\n\nP78 = [2, 3, 13]  # sum = 18\n```\n\n## Task\n\nCreate a function that takes a number `n` and returns:\n\n1. `\"Not a Ruth-Aaron pair\"` if it is not part of a Ruth-Aaron pair.\n\n2. A string `\"Ruth\"` if n is the smaller number in the pair, or `\"Aaron\"` if it is the larger followed by 1 if `n` is part of a Ruth-Aaron pair under the first definition (sum of distinct prime factors), 2 if it qualifies by the second definition, 3 if it qualifies under both.\n\n3. If the answer qualifies for both \"Aaron\" and \"Ruth\", your function should return \"Ruth\" part only. \n\n## Examples\n```\nruth_aaron(5) # \"Ruth-3\"\n\nruth_aaron(9) # \"Aaron-2\"\n\nruth_aaron(11) # \"Not a Ruth-Aaron pair\"\n\nruth_aaron(25) # \"Aaron-1\"\n\nruth_aaron(417163) # \"Ruth-2\"\n# Although both \"Ruth-2\" and \"Aaron-3\" are correct, your function should return \"Ruth-2\" only.\n```\n\n`Input : 2 <= n <= 10^6`\n\n## References\n[Ruth–Aaron pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth%E2%80%93Aaron_pair)",
