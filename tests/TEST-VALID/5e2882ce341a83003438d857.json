    "description": "🔨Υour friend Python just called you to hang out afterwards but you haven't finished you job yet. You are working at a courier company and you know which deliveries have left so you just need to calculate the time it will take you to complete them.🔨\n\n      courier(arr,n)\n  \n  ⚫ The arguments of the function is an array with all the locations of the delivery points and n the maximum number of packages you can carry at once.\n  \n  ⚫ It takes 2 minutes to load the packages at the store.\n  \n  ⚫ It takes 2 minutes to hand a package to the consignee.\n  \n  ⚫ Even if there are 2 or more consignees at the same location it will take 2 minutes each to complete the delivery. (For example 9n and 9n) \n  \n  ⚫ If the array is empty return 0.\n  \n  ✅ Your task is to calculate and return the least possible time it will take you (in minutes) to deliver all the packages and return back to the store.\n  \n            | n |\n            |   |\n            |   |\n     -------+   +-------     X = (0,0) is the location of the courier store\n      w       X       e      \n     -------+   +-------     There are four directions (West,East,North,South)\n            |   |\n            |   |\n            | s |\n    \n  ⚫ The first character is the direction and the second the minutes that it takes to get there if you follow that direction.\n  \n    arr = [\"w3\", \"e5\", \"n7\", \"s2\", \"s1\", \"w5\", \"e7\", \"n13\", \"w6\", \"e2\", \"e4\", \"e1\", \"n9\"]\n    \n 💡 Example:\n    \n    arr = [\"w3\", \"e5\", \"n7\", \"s2\", \"s1\", \"w5\", \"e7\", \"n13\", \"w6\", \"e2\", \"e4\", \"e1\", \"n9\"] \n    n=3\n    \n    Route:\n    📦📦📦You load 3 packages which is 2 minutes\n    Firstly you go at w6 which is 6 minutes away + 2 minutes the delivery\n    Secondly you go at w5 which is 1 minutes away from w6 + 2 minutes delivery time\n    Thirdly you go at w3 which is 2 minutes away from w5 + 2 minutes delivery time\n    Go back to the store which is 3 minutes away from w3\n    Time1= 20 minutes\n    \n    📦📦📦You load 3 packages which is 2 minutes\n    Firstly you go at e7 which is 7 minutes away + 2 minutes the delivery\n    Secondly you go at e5 which is 2 minutes away from e7 + 2 minutes delivery time\n    Thirdly you go at e4 which is 1 minutes away from e5 + 2 minutes delivery time\n    Go back to the store which is 4 minutes away from e4\n    Time2= Time1+22 = 42 minutes\n    \n    📦📦📦You load 3 packages which is 2 minutes\n    Firstly you go at n13 which is 13 minutes away + 2 minutes the delivery\n    Secondly you go at n9 which is 4 minutes away from n13 + 2 minutes delivery time\n    Thirdly you go at n7 which is 2 minutes away from n9 + 2 minutes delivery time\n    Go back to the store which is 7 minutes away from n7\n    Time3= Time2+34 = 76 minutes\n    \n    📦📦You load 2 packages which is 2 minutes\n    Firstly you go at w2 which is 2 minutes away + 2 minutes the delivery\n    Secondly you go at w1 which is 1 minutes away from w2 + 2 minutes delivery time\n    Go back to the store which is 1 minutes away from w1\n    Time4= Time3+10 = 86 minutes\n    \n    📦📦You load 2 packages which is 2 minutes\n    Firstly you go at e2 which is 2 minutes away + 2 minutes the delivery\n    Secondly you go at e1 which is 1 minutes away from e2 + 2 minutes delivery time\n    Go back to the store which is 1 minutes away from e1\n    Total= Time4+10 = 96 minutes\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ",
