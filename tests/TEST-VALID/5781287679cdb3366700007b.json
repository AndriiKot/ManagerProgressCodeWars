    "description": "You grew up your whole life playing tic tac toe and never lost a single game.  Fast forward 15 years and you are a computer programmer. You decide to create an online tic tac toe game where two people can play head to head. How exciting, such awesome nostalgia, drooling with excitement, you get started on the game engine!\n\nYour game engine is given an array of numbers where each number is a player's move.  The first number in the array is player one's move and the next number is player two's and the third number is player one's move again.  Each player alternates moves.\n\nThe gameboard has nine squares where a player can move.\n\n```    \n  1  |  2  |  3\n-----|-----|-----\n  4  |  5  |  6\n-----|-----|-----\n  7  |  8  |  9\n```\nIf a player is able to choose three squares which align horizontally, vertically or diagonally then they win.  Your game engine should return \"PLAYER ONE WINS\" if player one wins and \"PLAYER TWO WINS\" if player two wins.  If its a tie game then  th game engine should return \"TIE GAME\".\n\nHere is an example of player one winning:\n```moves = [5,6,1,9,3,7,2];```\n\nif player one is Xs and player two is Os then the resulting gameboard would look like this:\n```\n  X  |  X  |  X\n-----|-----|-----\n     |  X  |  O\n-----|-----|-----\n  O  |     |  O\n```\nThe game engine would return \"PLAYER ONE WINS\"",
