    "description": "You've just finished a [simple kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53dc54212259ed3d4f00071c/python) asking you to return the sum of an array.\nWhile you're drinking your tea scrolling on your colleagues solutions to find an inspiration for your daily dose of improving-yourself-techniques, you come up to [this](https://www.codewars.com/kata/reviews/54cd6ef118cae04721000085/groups/625b086705428e000102f722)\n![Gulp](https://www.kindpng.com/picc/m/43-432835_meme-face-meme-spitting-out-coffee-hd-png.png \"spitting the tea\")\nAfter quickly realising how brilliant that solution is, a tear drop from your eye thinking about how long it could have required to your untiring collegue(s) to came up with that. You then decide that you want to be part of the history and write a **code able to write the solution**.\n\nSince you want to give max value to the community you also decide that the `brilliant_solution` implementation will be able to print down the body of a function named `function_name` taking `variable_name` as a parameter and manually summing togheter up to `max_length` elements of an array.\n\n**Info**\n- Use the *exact same* ***formatting*** as the linked solution for the simple kata, i.e.:\n  - 4 spaces indentation (no tabs)\n  - No leading/trailing newlines\n  - Space beetween operators `x + y` not `x+y` and `len(x) == y` not `len(x)==y`\n- Beware that your implementation should be agnostic about the function and variable names, i.e. *make use of all the provided params*!",
