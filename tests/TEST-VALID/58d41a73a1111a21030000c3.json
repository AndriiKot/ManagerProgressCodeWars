    "description": "There is an online quiz to decide once and for all _the Best Drag Queen of All Time_ on the popular reality TV show \"RuPaul's Drag Race\". People have entered their top three favourite queens, and via some Javascript magic they have been entered onto an array of arrays. \n\nYour task is to create an object comprised of property-value pairs of Queens and the amount of votes they have.  You will then return the name of the Queen who has won the contest.\n\n**Good luck, and don't f\\*\\*k it up!**",
