    "description": "Write a funtion that tells me time I will wake up if I sleep for 8 hours. This function makes me sleep instantly.\n\n* Hello challenger! Your task is to write a function named `sleep` which takes in a time as a string and returns a time 8 hours later.\n *\n * The time will always be between 00:00 (inclusive) and 23:59 (inclusive).\n *\n * A few examples:\n *    `sleep` should return 08:00 as the time I wake up, if I fall asleep at 00:00\n *    `sleep` should return 17:57 as the time I wake up, if I fall asleep at 11:57\n ",
