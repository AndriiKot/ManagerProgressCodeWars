    "description": "In physics and mathematics, the [heat equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation#Statement%20of%20the%20equation) is a partial differential equation that describes how the distribution of some quantity (such as heat) evolves over time in a solid medium.\n\nWrite a function that simulates the temperature distribution over time using [Finite difference method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method#Example:%20The%20heat%20equation) with Explicit scheme.\n\nThe input for the function is a dictionary with problem specification. The function should initialize the interior of the array to `u_0`, set the boundary values on the perimeter. The boundary values stay constant.\n\n```python\n# Initialize e.g. rows, cols = 5, 7\n\n[\n  [100.   5.   5.   5.   5.   5. 100.]\n  [100.  10.  10.  10.  10.  10. 100.]\n  [100.  10.  10.  10.  10.  10. 100.]\n  [100.  10.  10.  10.  10.  10. 100.]\n  [100. 100. 100. 100. 100. 100. 100.]\n]\n```\nExecute the time simulation up to the largest value in `'n_steps': [0, 100, 200]`. Only the interior of the array changes on each time step. Save the value of temperature at observation point `\"observe\": [10, 10]` at specified time steps `[0, 100, 200]`. Return the list of temperatures, (of length 3 in this example.)\n\n**Examples**\nThe following three problems will be simulated. First has 3 hot boundaries, second has 2, third has hot bottom. These three set ups lead to different temperature distributions as can be seen in Figure.\n\n<left><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/2KGF1YB/Figure-3configs.png\" alt=\"Heat Equation\"></left>\n\n**Notes:**\n- The problem is two-dimensional, (needs partial derivatives for `x` and `y`).\n- The explicit formula is straightforward, the next `u^(n+1)` is computed directly using 5 points of `u^n`.\n- The provided parameter `r` is less than 1/4, thus the scheme is numerically stable.\n- Rounding is not needed, it will be done in the test cases.",
