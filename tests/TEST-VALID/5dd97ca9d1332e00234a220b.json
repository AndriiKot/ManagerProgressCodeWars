    "description": "You must write a function, `f`, which takes in an `Integral` and returns the number's primne factorisation, in ascending order. For numbers below two, the empty list can be returned.\n\nThe prime factorisation of a number, `n`, is a list, `l`, such that every element of `l` is prime, and the product of `l` is `n`. \n\n```hs\nf 46 = [2, 23] -- both these numbers are prime, and they multiply to 46\nf 25 = [5, 5] -- 5 is needed multiple times to have the value multiply to 25 \nf 0 = [] -- 0 is below 2\n```\n\nHowever, there are some restrictions on your code. After the initial code, **which must *not* be edited**, certain characters are not permitted. \n\nThese characters are: \n- `=`\n- `\\`\n- `[`\n- `` ` ``\n\nFurthermore, to weed out excessively long solutions, your solution must be less than or equal to `120` characters. \n\nPerformance should not be an issue here: numbers will be between `-1 * 10^6` and `1 * 10^6`, and there won't be excessive test cases.",
