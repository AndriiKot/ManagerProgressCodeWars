    "description": "In this Kata you are given an array and two numbers i and j. Your mission here is to compute the sum of all values in the array between the i-th smallest value to the the j-th smallest value.\n\n- The array is not necessarily sorted.\n- You can ticitly assume that 0 < i <= j < len(array)\n- In the following example, the 3rd smallest value is 4\n> [2, 1, 6, 4]\n- There can be duplicates and you should manage them (even if they are on the bounds).\nFor example: \n> [1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8], i = 3, j = 5.\n\nThe result would be 2+2+4+6=14 because the i-th smallest value is 2 (even though it is also the 2nd smallest value), the j-th smallest value is 6, and all the values in the array between 2 and 5 are: 2, 2, 4, 6.",
