    "description": "Many crypto-currencies use a proof-of-work mechanism to validate blocks of transactions. This process is actually quite simple: everyone competes to solve a compuational puzzle, with the winner deciding which transactions get included and receiving a reward for their efforts. Then the process repeats for the next block. \n\nThe puzzle must be computationally hard to solve, but easy to verify. A great canidate for this is finding a partial hash collision. In this kata, we will implement a simple miner for SHA256. You need to complete the following functions: \n\n\n`ComputeHash` takes the content of a block (any `string`) and a nonce. It should append the nonce to the content, take the UTF-8 encoding and return a SHA-256 hash of that. \n\n\n`GetDifficulty` returns an estimate of how much work went into finding a hash. It is simply the number of leading zeros. \n\n\n`FindNonce` is the mining function. For a given block and target difficulty, it should find a nonce that ensures the resulting hash difficulty is at least the target. \n",
