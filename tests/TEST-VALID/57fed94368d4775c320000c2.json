    "description": "We have an array that contains the length of many iron rods, ```available_rods```\nThe length of the rods are expressed in inches.\nWe have to form with them:\n\n- triangles that have at least one angle higher than 90° (rigth-angled triangles should be discarded)\n\n- the triangles should not have a side longer than a certain length, ```max_length```\n\n- the triangles should have an area that do not differ more than a certain percentage of relative difference, ```max_rel_diff``` in relative terms with a certain given area, ```est_area```,  value expressed in square feet. (1 in = 0.08333333 ft)\n\nLet's see an example:\n```\navailable_rods = [3, 11, 8, 5, 13, 10, 16, 21, 33] # rounded lengths in inches\nmax_length = 16 in # all the triangle sides should be under 16 inches\nest_area = 0.12 ft², the most suitable area value (for an specific need)\nmax_rel_diff = 40 % # all the relative difference with estimated area, est_area, have to be under 40%\n```\nThe relative difference is calculated as:\n```\nrel_differ = |area - est_area| / est_area * 100\n```\nWe list all the possible triangles ```[a, b, c] (a ≤ b < c)``` that have an angle higher than ```90°```, all its sides under the ```max_length``` and with a relative difference under ```max_rel_diff```\n```\nTriangles [a,b,c]  Biggest Angle(deg)      Area(in²)     Area(ft²)  rel_differ(%)\n[3, 10, 11]           101.54               14.6969        0.1021     14.95\n[3, 11, 13]           126.22               13.3112        0.0924     22.97\n[5, 8, 10]             97.90               19.8100        0.1376     14.64\n[5, 8, 11]            113.58               18.3303        0.1273      6.08\n[5, 10, 13]           116.10               22.4499        0.1559     29.92\n```\n\nWe need a function that receives the shown arguments in the following order:\n```\nsel_pieces(available_rods, max_length, est_area, rel_diff)\n```\nThe function will output the triangles sorted by the lowest value of ```rel_differ```.\n\nThe above case will be:\n```python\navailable_rods = [3, 11, 8, 5, 13, 10, 16, 21, 33]\nmax_length = 16\nest_area = 0.12\nmax_rel_diff = 40\nsel_pieces(available_rods, max_length, est_area, rel_diff) == [[5, 8, 11], [5, 8, 10], [3, 10, 11], [3, 11, 13], [5, 10, 13]]\n```\nIn case that there are no triangles that fulfill these properties, the function will output an empty array.\n```python\navailable_rods = [3, 11, 8, 5, 13, 10, 16, 21, 33]\nmax_length = 16\nest_area = 0.12\nmax_rel_diff = 5\nsel_pieces(available_rods, max_length, est_area, rel_diff) == []\n```\nFeatures of the tests:\n``` \nN (Number of tests) = 150\namount of available rods, l; 10 ≤ l ≤ 60\n5 in ≤ max_length ≤ 300 in\n0,0069 ft²≤ est_area ≤ 6.25 ft²\n5 % ≤ max_rel_differ ≤ 50 %\n```\nEnjoy it!!",
