    "description": "In this kata, your challenge is to take a quote in the form of a string ```(quote)``` and shorten it to a given maximum length ```(max)```. \n\nThe shortened quote should end with an ellipsis (...). The ellipsis should be taken into account in the overall length.\n\nIf the quote is empty or shorter than ```max```, return the quote.\n\nIf the quote is cut off mid-word, the incomplete word should be removed from the string and replaced by an ellipsis. In addition, if the string ends with another punctuation mark or a space before the ellipsis, that punctuation mark or space should be removed. In both cases the resulting string may be shorter than the maximum length. \n\nFor example:\n\n'This is a quot...' should be 'This is a...'\n\n'This is a quote!...' should be 'This is a quote...'\n\n'This is a quote ...' should be 'This is a quote...'\n\nFor the purposes of this kata, all punctuation marks will be followed by a space. The only punctuation marks that might appear in the quote will be: ! ? . , ; : -\n",
