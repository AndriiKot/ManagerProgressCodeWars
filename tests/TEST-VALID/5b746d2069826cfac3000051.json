    "description": "<strong>This is a coding take on a traditional Vietnamese dice game of chance.</strong>\n\nIf one die corresponds with a bet, the bettor receives 1x amount as their bet, 2x for two corresponding dice, and 3x for 3 dice. Else the bet is lost.\n\nFor instance, if one were to place £3 on fish, and the dealer rolls 2 fish and 1 stag, then the bettor would receive £6 while keeping the £3 they had bet. For simplicity, in this instance one would have a net +6. In this instance, if they had lost the bet, they would receive -3.\n\n<strong>Full rules:</strong> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%E1%BA%A7u_cua_c%C3%A1_c%E1%BB%8Dp\n\n\nThe 6 dice sides are representated by string values of the following:\n\"fish\", \"prawn\", \"crab\", \"rooster\", \"stag\", \"calabash\"\n\n<h1>Solution:</h1>\nGiven function rollDice, there are two parameters; dice and bets. Dice is a length 3 string array representing the dice throws for a single round.\nBets is a map of maps, maintaining player names-to-dice sides-to-bet amounts.\n\nE.g.\n\n```javascript\nrollDice( [\"fish\", \"fish\", \"stag\"], \n          {\n            \"Billy\": {\n              \"fish\": 3,\n              \"rooster\": 5\n            },\n            \"Michael\": {\n              \"prawn\": 10\n            },  \n            \"Lucille\": {\n              \"calabash\": 3,\n              \"stag\": 8\n            }\n          }\n        )\n```\n\n---\nReturn a map of participating player names to an integer sum of each players total winnings (or losses)\n\nE.g.\n```javascript\n{Billy: 1, Michael: -10, Lucille: 5}\n```\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Additional assumptions:</strong>\n- There are no limits on the number of players\n- There are no limits on bet size\n- Potentially, zero bets can occur in a round\n- Each player can bet on zero-six places\n\n",
