    "description": "`NOTE: Pls dont be too harsh when judging my kata`\n\nThe goal of this kata is to return the area of a trapezoid, seems simple right?\nWell, I decided to make this kata a little harder by making it so that you have to round the answer down or up. If the number after the decimal is less than 5 then round it down, otherwise round it up\n\n`Here is the equation to get the area of a trapezoid ->` \n```\n1. Identify the length of both bases. The bases are the two parallel sides of the trapezoid.\n\n2. Add the lengths of the bases.\n\n3. Identify the height of the trapezoid.\n\n4. Multiply the sum of the lengths of the bases by the height.\n\n5. Divide the result by two.\n```\n\nPS: I already imported math for you ;)",
