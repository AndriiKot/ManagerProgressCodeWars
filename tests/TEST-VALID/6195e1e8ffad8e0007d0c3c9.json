    "description": "Happy Prime Numbers\n---\nMy boss needs me to make an efficient happy prime number program in order to test the speed of the new equipment we got today! Do you think you can help me write it? (I cheated my way into this job, I don't know how to code).\n\nGiven an integer <b>num</b> ```2 <= num <= 10,000,000```, can you tell me if it's a happy prime number (a number that is both prime and happy as the name implies)?\n\nThis code tests efficiency, random tests will go up to 5,000,000 integers, so make sure it's up to my boss's standards! (or else I'm fired, no pressure though).\n\nWhat is a prime number?\n---\nA prime number is a number that is only divisible by the number one and itself.\n```\nEX) 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 ...\n```\n\nWhat is a happy number?\n---\nA happy number is when you take the digits of a number, square each of them, and add them. If it eventually reaches the number ```1```, it's a happy number. If it loops infinitely and never reaches ```1```, then it is not a happy number.\n```\nEX) 19 -> 1^2 + 9^2 = 82\n    82 -> 8^2 + 2^2 = 68\n    68 -> 6^2 + 8^2 = 100\n    100 -> 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1\n```",
