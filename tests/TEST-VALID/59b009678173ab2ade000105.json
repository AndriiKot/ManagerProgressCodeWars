    "description": "Javascript programmers are quite lazy. They don't like the long bureaucratic syntax constructions inherent for strongly typed static languages, such as Java or C#. Perhaps that's why the encapsulation mechanism in JS implemented... quite frivolously. We don't need to write these annoying access modifiers, instead, within the team or a whole community we agree about rules for naming private properties(like starting with underscore) and never touch them without a permission. And it works well while your teammates are disciplined. But if someone starts to behave saucily - the problems begin. Even worse when you call or email that person and get one answer: -BRAAAINS!\n\nOkay, we'll deal with those fella later, but right now we need to protect our code from invasion.\nAs a starting point you have two predefined classes `User` and `Zombie`. You cannot override them or modify their prototypes, however you also have their instances `ashWilliams` and `evilAsh` respectively, free for manipulations. `evilAsh` object has a method `gobbleBrains()` which invades our \"private\"(in fact not) property.\n\nYour goal is to prevent `evilAsh` from modifying his own `_stomach` and `ashWilliams`'s `_brains` property, while the other user `annieKnowby` must retain the access to other properties not interesting to evil Ash.\n\nIf you want go further try not only to prohibit `evilAsh` from changing his stomach, but instead feed him with `bullets` value. This will not affect the tests, but you will be rewarded for your bravery with a secret message.\n\nKeep in mind that you need to deal with instances, not classes, you also shouldn't worry about Annie, she's in safe place. Only about Ash.\n\nPlacing your code inside a function is not necessary, you can write in a plain way.",
