    "description": "### Definition:\n*A full adder adds binary numbers and accounts for values carried in as well as out. A one-bit full-adder adds three one-bit numbers, often written as A, B, and Cin; A and B are the operands, and Cin is a bit carried in from the previous less-significant stage.* \n\n[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics))\n\n### Your task:\n\nWrite a function that will return both the carry-out's value and the sum of an addition operation.\n\n### Input :\n\nA carry-in bit and two bits to be added, being integers 0 or 1.\n\n### Output :\n\nAn array (tuple in Python) containing, in this order, the carry-out bit and the result bit of the addition.\n",
