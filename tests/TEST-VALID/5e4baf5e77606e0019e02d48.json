Using your thinking cap analyze the examples given and write a function that can decipher any ciphered string given to you.\n\nOnly lowercase characters will be given, spaces are not effected by the cipher (they should stay in place and not be manipulated).\n\nGood luck!\n\nP.s: Look at the test cases to for the three examples given",
