    "description": "# Description\n\nIn a delightful cookie shop, a variety of cookies is listed prices with different prices (`pl`). Alex, with `m` amount of cash in hand, wishes to purchase as many cookies as possible.\n\n## Task\n\nYour task is to create a function, `mostCookies`, which takes in:\n\n- `m`, a number representing the available cash Alex has.\n- `pl`, an **unsorted** list of numbers, where each element indicates the price of a cookie.\n\nThe function should return a numerical value indicating the maximum number of cookies Alex can purchase.\n\n### Example\n\n```typescript\nlet cashInHand = 10;\nlet cookiePrices = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n// Purchase the first cookie (10 - 1 = 9)\n// Purchase the second cookie (9 - 2 = 7)\n// Purchase the third cookie (7 - 3 = 4)\n// Purchase the fourth cookie (4 - 4 = 0)\n// Out of cash to purchase the fifth cookie; thus, Alex can buy a maximum of 4 cookies.\n\nmostCookies(cashInHand, cookiePrices); // 4\n```\n\n## Constraints\n\n- `m >= 0`\n- `pl.length >= 0`\n- `m`, and the sum of `pl` will never exceed the maximum integer size.",
