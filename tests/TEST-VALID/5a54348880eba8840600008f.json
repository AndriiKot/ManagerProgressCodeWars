    "description": "In this puzzle, there are seven depots to arrange. Each depot is that of a hexagon, and their six walls (sides) are marked with a special type of material. We have to arrange the seven depots with one in the center and the other six surrounding it (in the shape of a bigger hexagon). However, every wall that is shared by two depots must have a matching material (letter) on the same side. The depots may be turned, but the order of the sides must be rotated along with it. For example, the depots (as a hexagon) can be rotated to turn from this orientation to the left to the right:\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5595067/32763380-4cadec04-c93a-11e7-8d52-6884c9dea40a.png)\n\nThey may not be flipped as a mirror image.\n\nFor your reference, here is a visualization of a test case and its solution:\n\n**Puzzle:**\n\n    W T J G N D\n    X F W K C M\n    M N X T R W\n    B C V Q J G\n    M T S D V K\n    C F S G K B\n    G T R M W C\n\n**Solution:**\n\n    4K 1X 2R 6C 5G 0J 3C\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5595067/32763805-ee635f64-c93c-11e7-9050-7996f726a882.png)\n\n(Problem based on: Hexagon Puzzle (Problem 24) from HP CodeWars 2017 NA)\n\n<div style=\"padding:8px;border-radius:1%;background:rgba(255,255,255,.08)\">\n\n<h2>Input</h2>\n\n<p>**Each of 7 strings: Six** capital <span style=\"background:rgba(180,120,180,.65);color:black;border-radius:5px;padding:1px 4px\">letters</span> seperated by spaces, marking the texture of the walls around depot <span style=\"background:rgba(120,180,120,.65);color:black;border-radius:5px;padding:1px 4px\">X</span> (**0**-indexed) in clockwise order.\n\n<h2>Output</h2>\n\n<p>The unique solution of **seven** pairs of two characters, a **number** of that of <span style=\"background:rgba(120,180,120,.65);color:black;border-radius:5px;padding:1px 4px\">depot index</span> and a <span style=\"background:rgba(180,120,180,.65);color:black;border-radius:5px;padding:1px 4px\">letter</span>.
