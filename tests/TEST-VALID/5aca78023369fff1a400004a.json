    "description": "There has been a murder! You're the pathologist putting together an autopsy report for the case. As a pathologist, your job is to examine the marks on the body against the evidence found at the crime scene and analyse what single weapon was used to ultimately commit the murder.\n\nYour colleague just told you about a computer programme that can search through the evidence for you. You didn't really get all the techy details of how the program works, but your colleague explained that it's based on that recent famous crime data discovery showing that *murder weapons most often are just the longest word in the evidence list*.\n\nYou decide to run it. But it is not working. There is something wrong with the code.\nTry to fix it so you can use it as an excuse to play around on your computer all day at work.",
