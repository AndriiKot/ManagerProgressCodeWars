    "description": "<strong>Your task is to split a number into multiple numbers by proportionals like this:</strong><br>\n<pre><code class='language-python'>split_number(integer=100, proportionals=[1/3, 1/3, 1/3]) -> [34, 33, 33]</code></pre>\n\n<strong>Input data:</strong><br>\n— Integer, -1000 <= integer <= 1000.<br>\n— Proportionals, 0.000 <= proportional <= 1.000,  \nSum(Proportionals) ≈ 1,  \n0 <= Length(Proportionals) <= 12,\ntype(proportional) is Decimal.<br>\n\n<strong>Output data:</strong><br>\n— List of numbers,  \nSum(List of numbers) = Integer <u>(if Sum(Proportionals) ≈ 1)</u>.<br>\nIf Proportionals is empty, return [].\n\nIf integer is a negative number, then the algorithm must work with it as a non-negative one, but multiply every number in list by -1.\n\n<strong>Example #1.</strong>\n<pre>\ninteger = 916\nproportionals = [0.53, 0.47]\n916 * 0.53 = 485.48\n916 * 0.47 = 430.52\n\nWe remove the fractional parts of the numbers and sum up:\n485 + 430 = 915\nWe need to add 1 to get the integer = 916.\nWe look at the resulting fractional parts (0.48 and 0.52) and determine which number we have to round to get the integer = 916.\n(0.52 > 0.48)\nWe round up 430.52 -> 431.\n\n485 + 431 = 916. Done.\nResult = [485, 431]\n</pre>\n\n<strong>Example #2.</strong>\n<pre>\ninteger = 2\nproportionals = [0.1, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2]\n2 * 0.1 = 0.2\n2 * 0.4 = 0.8\n2 * 0.3 = 0.6\n2 * 0.2 = 0.4\n\nWe remove the fractional parts of the numbers and sum up:\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\nWe need to add 2 to get the integer = 2.\nWe look at the resulting fractional parts (0.2, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4) and determine which numbers we have to round to get the integer = 2.\n(0.8 > 0.6 > 0.4 > 0.2)\nWe round up 0.8 -> 1. We have to add another 1 to get the integer = 2.\nWe round up 0.6 -> 1. Done.\nResult = [0, 1, 1, 0]\n</pre>\n\nNote.\nIf the fractional parts are equal, the first one is chosen.",
