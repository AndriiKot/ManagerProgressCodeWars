    "description": "At Billing Pty Ltd our system records invoices with a datetime in this format: `2019-06-03 15:03:59` (yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS).\n\nManagement has asked us to report the volume of invoices processed weekly. Luckily our reporting system can do this, but we first need to convert the invoice date string into a __*date value*__ which represents the reporting week it falls into.\n\n**Your Task**: Given a date string, return the reporting week (as date) it falls into.\n\n**An important note**: the Billing Pty Ltd __*reporting week*__ refers to __*week ending*__ and runs from __Friday to Thursday__. \n\nIf an invoice date is `2019-06-03 15:03:59`, it will fall in reporting week ending `2019-06-06` (Thursday). \n\n```\n# Examples:\n\n>>> get_reporting_date('2019-06-03 15:03:59') --> datetime.date(2019, 6, 6)\n>>> get_reporting_date('2016-03-07 22:43:18') --> datetime.date(2016, 3, 10)\n```\n\n**Date inputs will always be valid.**",
