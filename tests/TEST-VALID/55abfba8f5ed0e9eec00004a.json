    "description": "JSON is a simple data-interchange format that is based on a simplified version of JavaScript's object notation. The [official website](http://json.org/) has a great description of the language.\n\nYour task is to implement a function that, given any JavaScript value, returns a string that is the equivalent JSON representation of that value. You should not include any additional whitespace in the output. For example, `stringify(123) === \"123\"` and `stringify({ a: [1, 2] }) === '{\"a\":[1,2]}'`.\n\nYour implementation will not be tested against strings with non-ascii characters or escape sequences, so you do not need to attempt to correctly encode such strings. Your implementation also does not need to deal with circular references.\n\n`JSON.stringify` has been disabled for this kata.",
