    "description": "In the Poker game Texas Hold'em, a player is dealt 2 cards randomly out of a standard 52-card deck.  Write a function that accepts a string which defines a 2-card starting hand.  Your function should return the number of possible combinations of the 2-card hand in a 52-card deck.  The string can represent an exact specific hand, a specific pair (e.g. 22, 77), a specific type of hand of any suit, or a suited or offsuit combo.  the character 'T' reperesents a ten, and 'Q' 'K' 'A' represent queens, kings, and aces. Suits are represented by lowercase letters: 'd' for diamond, 's' for spade, 'c' for club, and 'h' for heart.  See example strings below: \n\nPocket pairs:\n\n'22'    //a pair of twos \n\n'TT'    //a pair of tens \n\n'KK'    //a pair of kings \n\nExact hand combos:\n\n'AsKd'  //Ace of spades and King of diamonds\n\n'QdTd'  //Queen of diamonds and Ten of diamonds \n\n'4d4s'  //4 of diamonds and 4 of spades\n\nAny of a specific hand, suited OR offsuit: \n\n'AK'    //Any Ace and King, any suit \n\n'78'    //Any 7 and 8, any suit\n\nAny of a specific suited hand: \n\n'AKs'   //Any Ace and King of same suit\n\n'78s'   //Any 7 and 8 of same suit\n\nAny of a specific off-sut hand: \n\n'AKo'  //Any Ace and King not of same suit \n\n'89o'  //Any 8 and 9 not of same suit\n\nYour function should return -1 for any invalid string.  Otherwise it should return the number of possible combinations of the given hand.  Here are some examples: \n\n'4d4d'  //Return -1 because there is only one 4 of diamonds in the deck, this is invalid.\n\n'4d4s'  // Return 1,because this represents an exact specific hand, there is only one combo of this hand in the deck. \n\n\n                \n\n\n  ",
