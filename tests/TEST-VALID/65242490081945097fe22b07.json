    "description": "# Soccer leagues home/away games\n\nIn major soccer leagues like the Premier League or LaLiga, each team plays against every other team: once at their own stadium (a \"home\" game) and once at the opposing team's stadium (an \"away\" game).\n\nYour task is to create a function that calculates the total number of games each team will play during a season.\n\nRemember, the function should be scalable and adaptable for different league sizes.\n\n\n## Input\n\nThe function will always receive a positive number of teams (> 0).\n\n## Output\n\nAn integer, representing the total number of games each team will play in the season.",
