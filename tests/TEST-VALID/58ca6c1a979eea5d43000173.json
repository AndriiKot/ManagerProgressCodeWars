    "description": "You have two similar cuboids, A and B. Given the corresponding side lengths of both cuboids and the volume of A, work out the volume of B.\n\nIn this exercise, you will create a function that will take three parameters: ```a_side```, ```a_side```, and ```a_volume```, all of which are positive integers. You must return the volume of cuboid B as a float rounded to 2 decimal points. Units of measurment (such as kilmeters or inches) are ignored. \n\nFor example, if the parameters passed are ```(4, 8, 10)```, the output should be ```80```.\n\n**Hint:** To calculate the volume of a cuboid using side lengths, you must take the ratio of ```a_side``` and ```b_side``` and then cube it before assossiating it with ```a_volume```. \n\nIf you can, try writing it in one line of code.",
