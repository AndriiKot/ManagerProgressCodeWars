    "description": "(Three weeks earlier...)\n\nIn a distant land in a galaxy far far away a wild master jedi suddenly appears.\nHe tells you that if you guess what number he is thinking of he will grant you what ever wish you want (even if that wish is to have unlimited wishes)\n\nHowever if you do not guess the correct number in three attempts the universe will implode.\n\nTo make it easy on you he will only choose a number between 1-15\nand you can ask three times in which of three groups the number resides.\n\ni.e. \n```javascript\n(whichGroup([ [1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10], [11,12,13,14,15] ]) => 1-3)\n```\n\np.s. in order to prevent you from cheating he will make you guess the correct number 42 times\n\nalso no emtpy groups and only numbers 1-15 allowed \n```javascript\n[] => bad || [16,17,18] => not good\n```\nmust provide all 15 numbers devided in 3 groups \n```javascript\n[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10] [11,12,13,14] => missing 15\n```\neach number can only appear once ie. \n```javascript\n[1,2,3,4,5], [1,2,3,4,5] => no can do\n```\n\n\nDo you dare to embark upon this quest?",
