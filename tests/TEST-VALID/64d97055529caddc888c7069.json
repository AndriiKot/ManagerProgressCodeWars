    "description": "Given an array of integers numbers and an integer target, find the indices of two numbers in the array such that they add up to the given target.\n\nYou may not assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. However you may assume that each array has a length of at least two\n\nYou should return the sum of the indices that have the lowest. If there are no possible sums, return -1\n\nEX1: Given the array [8, 4, 2, 6, 12, 43, 95, 14] and target 18, there should be two solutions (6,12) and (4, 14)\nThe indices are [3,4] and [1,7] respectively.\n\nYour output should be 7 as 3 + 4 < 1 + 7 (7 < 8)\n\nEx 2: Given the array [1, 2] and target 4, we can see that there is no way to get a sum of 4 using 1 + 2 so in this case your output should be -1",
