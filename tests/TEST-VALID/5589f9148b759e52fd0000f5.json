    "description": "In the following squares:\n\n![puzzle][puzzle]\n\nArrange the digits 1 to 8 in the squares so that no two consecutive integers touch each other at a side or corner.\n\nex:\n```\n[_],[A],[B],[_],\n[C],[D],[E],[F],\n[_],[G],[H],[_]\n```\nIf we set cell **A** to be **2**. Cells B, C, D *and* E can't be **3**.\n\nIf we set cell **D** to be **4**. Cells A, B, C, E, G *and* H can't be **5**.\n\nNo number can repeat.\n\nThere's 4 answers for this puzzle. You have to find at least one of them.\n\nThe function **puzzle_answer** should return a *tuple* with *size 8* and the numbers should be in the order *(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H)*.\n\nTip: You should be able to answer this with 8 range(1, 9) stacked, but that would take a lot of memory. How can you reduce the memory usage?\n\nThe template function is just to give a head start, you can solve it in any form you like. If possible don't google the answer or return a hard-coded answer, show how you came to this answer.\n\n[puzzle]: http://www.dr-mikes-math-games-for-kids.com/linkimgs/8puzzle.png",
