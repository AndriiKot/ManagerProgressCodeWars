    "description": "# Leaderboard Insertion Challenge\n\nHello, algorithm enthusiasts! It's an exciting time to explore something unique, particularly in the realm of searching algorithms.\n\n### Meet the Creator\nI'm Ahmed Saber, a frontend software developer with a passion for creating engaging games and incorporating gamification into websites. Recently, I worked on adding a leaderboard to a game and found joy in using binary search for this task. I'm eager to share this challenge with you, confident that you'll handle it with ease. Best of luck!\n\n### Your Task: `insertIntoLeaderboard`\nYou are to implement a function named `insertIntoLeaderboard`. This function takes two parameters:\n\n1. `leaderboard`: An array of objects, each representing a player.\n2. `player`: An object containing two properties:\n   - `username`: A string representing the player's name.\n   - `score`: An integer representing the player's score.\n\n#### Specifications\n- The `leaderboard` array is sorted based on `player.score`.\n- Your function should find the correct position for `player` in the `leaderboard`, insert them at that position, and return the updated leaderboard as a new array (Don't mutate the original array).\n- If there are multiple players with the same score, place the new player after all current players with that score.\n- **Important**: Avoid using the `push` method followed by `sort` to insert the player. We are looking for a more efficient solution.\n\n#### Approach\n- You may use either linear search or binary search.\n\nGet ready to dive in and have fun with this algorithmic challenge!\n",
