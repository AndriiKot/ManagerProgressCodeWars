    "description": "What are your chances of getting at least one \"6\" if you roll a six-sided die 6 times?\n\n100%? It can't be. You don't always get a 6 when you roll 6 times.\n\nWhat are you chances of getting into that school you want, knowing their admission rate is x% and you have 'y' shots.\n\nWrite a function for this. baseChance should take a number 1-100 or 0.01 to 1.00 and output a String percentage of your chances of 'winning' given numShots. Round the result to 2 decimal places.\n\nex. 50% win chance for 5 tries => 96.88% chance of winning total.\n\nHelpful Wikipedia link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion%E2%80%93exclusion_principle",
