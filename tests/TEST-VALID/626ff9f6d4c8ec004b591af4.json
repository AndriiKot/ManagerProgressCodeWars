    "description": "# **Description**\n*Quadratics are a topic in math that involve squaring a variable. In most quadratics you see the variable happens to be x, and that is what you will be seeing in this kata. Your job is to return the number of solutions (roots, zeros, etc.) of a quadratic. **Pretend that imaginary solutions dont exist.***\n\n## **Input**\n*The input to the function `num_of_solutions` will be a string `quad` that is in standard form for a quadratic - `ax^2+bx+c`. There will be no spaces in the string, and x squared will be represented by `x^2`. `a`, `b`, and `c` will always be integers and there will always be a value in their place. Ex: `1x^2+0x+0` **The input string will never be empty.***\n\n## **Examples**\n```python\nnum_of_solutions('1x^2+0x+0')\nreturn 1\nnum_of_solutions('-10x^2-3x-12')\nreturn 0\nnum_of_solutions('-3x^2+34x+26')\nreturn 2\n```\n**Hint:** *Use the discriminant*\n\n**Note:** *Generating a random equation that only has 1 solution is relatively improbable, so expect to see a bunch of those in the fixed tests.*",
