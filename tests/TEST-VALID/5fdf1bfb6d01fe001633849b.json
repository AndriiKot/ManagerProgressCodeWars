    "description": "Vishnu is a curious little boy who works in a newspaper shop located at the coasts of a harbour. Every day he arrives to work, he notices his favourite ship 'GT-3096' parked at its berth ready to depart. He loves the ship so much that he knows every details of the ship and even the number of rungs on the ladder. Every morning he sees 30 rungs above the sea level while the 30th rung just touching the sea.\n\nBut at the evening he always noticed only few rungs are visible. He knows that 'GT-3096' returns with cargo that will submerge some rungs due to added weight. So poor Vishnu always tries to predict the rungs that will be visible, but never gets it right.</br>\nGiven that:<pre lang=\"python\"><code>1. Each rung is 2 inches thick\n2. The gap between the rungs is 8 inches\n3. The ship submerges 1 inch for every 50 kg of load\n</code></pre>\n<img src='https://i.imgur.com/11RvpEh.png'>\nHelp Vishnu predict the number of rungs that could be seen during the arrival of 'GT-3096', if Cargo carried is given as x(int) in kg's and the sea level raised that day due to tide is given as y(int) in inches.</br>\n<u><b>Example</b></u></br>\n[x,y]=[4000,5]</br>\nMeans 4000 kg of Cargo carried and 5 inches of sea level raise</br>\n--return int</br>\nint = rungs above sea level",
