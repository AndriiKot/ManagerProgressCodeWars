    "description": "Hey, I'm Captain Quentin Lance of the Star City Police Department and I n3eed your help. There are so many vigilantes and hooded criminals running around here that it's impossible to keep track of them all and remember who's a good guy and who's a bad guy. So to help me keep track I have two lists, ```$good_guys``` and ```$bad_guys``` but I need to be able to keep them updated. What I need you to do is to create a function that will take a name ```$name``` and what team they're on ```(boolean) $good```. The name should be checked against the corresponding list, and if it's not on there, add it.\n\nClarification:\n```$good_guys``` and ```$bad_guys``` are arrays of strings.\n```$name``` is a string.\n```$good``` is a boolean returning true if it's a good guy and false if they're bad.\nWhen a name is added, it should be at the end of its list.\nReturn the list that has been modified, if no modification has been made (i.e. the name was already on the list), return null.\n\nNote: Cptn. Lance isn't a particularly tech savvy guy and could easily end up making a mistake such as accidentally inputting a number instead of a name _\\*hint hint\\*_.",
