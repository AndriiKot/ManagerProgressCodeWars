    "description": "A \"2 + 1\" promotional offer (sometimes called \"buy two, get the third free\" or \"buy three for the price of two\") means that when a customer buys three items of certain products, they get the cheapest item for free.\n\nA till machine is required to compute the price to charge a customer buying items on offer.\n\nWhen there are only three items, the job is easy: Pick the cheapest one and discount it. But when there are more (say six items in total), there are multiple computation strategies.\n\nThe till could choose the two cheapest items and discount them, and we would say this is a computation strategy that favours the shop (as the discount is the least possible).\n\n**What would be a computation strategy that favours the customer (i.e. maximizes the discount)?**\n\n---\n\nPlease note: The basic rule of _cheapest for free_ must still hold.\n\n---\n\nYou will be passed an array of numbers representing a customer's basket. Each number represents the price of an item participating in the same \"2 + 1\" offer. The number of items will be a multiple of three.\n\n**Return the total price to charge the customer after applying all discounts.** Use a computation strategy that favours the customer.\n\n_(Idea: [Tamás Keleti](https://www.facebook.com/tamas.keleti.79/posts/10154729747267435))_",
