    "description": "A standard clock has a seconds, minutes, and hours hand. Neglecting the seconds hand, the minutes and hours hands coincide every 65 minutes.\n\nWrite a function that is given the number of hours of a half-day (e.g., 12 hours is a standard half-day), and returns the time in minutes between the hour and minute hands coinciding.\n\n**Note**:\n\n* If the number of hours in half a day is 13, the number of minutes in an hour is 65.\n\n* If the number of minutes is a decimal, the margin for error with calculations is 1e-5.",
