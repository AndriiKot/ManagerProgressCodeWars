    "description": "You work in a warehouse. In the castle. Or on a spaceship (you decide). Soon the battle, and you need to distribute equipment to the soldiers. Each set of equipment consists of several parts. And you have these parts full warehouse. \nEach one has an engraved name, number and how many parts in the set. For example, like this: ```Hero 3000 - part 1/3```. So ```Hero 3000 - part 1/3```, ```Hero 3000 - part 2/3``` and ```Hero 3000 - part 3/3``` are one set ```Hero 3000``` \n\nIn your warehouse, all parts of one set (with the same name) are guaranteed to have the same number of parts in a set.\n\nSoldiers can only be issued fully assembled sets. This means that the kit should contain all the necessary parts and all from one set. If something is lacking or not suitable, the soldier will immediately die, so it is better not to let him go into battle at all.\n \nAt the entrance you have an array of parts, and the output should be an array of assembled sets - just names (in alphabetical order, lower to higher).\n\nIf there are not enough parts for any set, the result will be an empty array.\n\nAttention, if there are enough pieces for 2 sets, then you should collect 2.",
