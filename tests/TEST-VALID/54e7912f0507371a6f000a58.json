    "description": "Create a utulity that given the name and source code for a class compiles it and returns its `Class` instance to the user. It is strongly suggested that the `javax.tools.JavaCompiler` class is used for this instead of trying to implement your own compiler.\n\nYour implementation should provide the method\n\n    Class<?> compileAndLoad(String name, String source);\n    \nThe rules for the arguments to be accepted are:\n\n* `name` must not be `null`\n* `source` must not be `null`\n* `source` must be valid Java code for a single class (inner classes are allowed)\n* `name` must be the fully qualified name of the class (e.g. `my.project.MyClass`)\n* `name` must not be a duplicate of any classes that already exist\n\nIf any of these rules are broken please throw an exception.\n\nHints: \n\n* The `JavaCompiler` and related classes are meant to read Java code from a file and output the compiled class data to another file. You will have to get it to read and write to a `String` or `byte[]`.\n* In order to load a compiled class you will need to use a `ClassLoader`. You may find `defineClass(String, byte[], int, int)` useful for this.\n* If a class has one or more inner classes make sure to load them as well or you will fail some of the test cases.\n* The CodeWars solution validator does not like when things get printed to `System.err` and under the default configuration the `JavaCompiler` class will print error messages there for some of the test cases. As such make sure to configure the `JavaCompiler` so that it does not print to `System.err`.",
