    "description": "DESCRIPTION:\nI recently did a math test where a question was to find the high prime number in an interval.\nI really liked this idea and decided to standardise it into a programming problem and a kata.\n\nINSTRUCTION:\nSimply return the largest prime number within an interval.\nIf the interval includes no prime number then return -1.\n\nThe highest and lowest numbers are not included.\n\nEx. 10 < x < 20, 19 is the largest prime.\n\nGOOD LUCK!",
