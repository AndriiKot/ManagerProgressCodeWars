    "description": "Oh no! You've magically been transported to a world without digits!\n\nYou'll need to write a function that evaluates mathematical expressions in plain words like:\n\n```three plus five``` or ```ten divided by two```\n\nand returns the correct answer in in plain words.\n\nYou may not use digits at all in your function. Nobody knows what those are.\n\nRules:\n\n  You only need to evaluate expressions containing whole positive numbers from ```zero``` to ```one hundred```\n\n  They will only evaluate to whole positive numbers from ```zero``` to ```one hundred```.\n\n  You only need to deal with one operator in each expression\n  \n  operators will be (```plus``` , ```minus```, ```times``` , or ```divided by```). \n",
