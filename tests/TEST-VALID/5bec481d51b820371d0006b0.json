    "description": "In this challenge, you will be given an array of positive integers for example `[1,2,3,4,5]` and another positive integer such as `100` called total. For the array, you must either add the numbers (1 and 2 becomes 1+2), subtract the numbers (1 and 2 becomes 1-2), or combine them together (1 and 2 becomes 12) with the goal of creating an equation where the final solution is the total provided. An example would be:\n\nGiven the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] and the total 100\n- one equation would be 12+3-4+5+67+8+9 which equals 100\n- another equation would be 1+2+34-5+67-8+9 which also equals 100\n\nThe return value of this function should be the number of equations of the numbers in the array that match the total.\n\nex. `addsTo([1,2,3,4,5], 15)` // returns 2 (because `1+2+3+4+5 = 15` and `1+23-4-5 = 15`)\n\nex. `addsTo([3,4,5,6,7,8], 65)` // returns 0\n\nex. `addsTo([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], 100)` // return 11 because `12+3+4+5-6-7+89 = 100` and 10 others\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES**:\n- Do not change the order of the numbers.\n- There is no limit on the length of the array.\n- **Do _not_ use leading zeros** so [1,2,3,0,2,3] should return 2: `123 - 0 - 23` and `123 + 0 - 23` but **NOT** `123 - 023`.\n\nFor an added challenge, try to complete this without using `eval`",
