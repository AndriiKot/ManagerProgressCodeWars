    "description": "#### Something very weird is happening with arrays! \n\n#### Array literals seem to work well enough, but arrays from the Array function are oddly glitchy... \n\n#### Before you start trying to figure out the cause, a notification pops up on your screen. It's a message from that one prankster coworker to the entire office: \n> Anyone notice anything wrong with their arrays this morning? I'll buy lunch for whoever figures out what I did and how to fix it... as long as you can figure it out before the boss notices and yells at me to stop it :)\n\n### Oh dear :/\n\n\n###### *Any help making this kata harder to figure out would be appreciated :)*",
