    "description": "You are given a string composed of numbers between 0 and 99 intercalated with letters from a to z (all lowercase). The output should be a string in wich each pair of number(n) and letter is represented by the letter repeated n times. To avoid generating excesively large strings, the function must substitute every ten character repetition for the one of the same character in uppercase.\n\nexplained example:\n  \n      '3a21b': 3a -> 'aaa', 21b -> 'BBb'\n      \n      result -> 'aaaBBb'\n      \nExamples:\n\n      '' -> ''\n      '0a' ->  ''\n      '99j0i0y7g' -> 'JJJJJJJJJjjjjjjjjjggggggg'\n      \nIf the input is an empty string the output should also be an empty string. Don't worry about handling input errors as the input will always be a valid string",
