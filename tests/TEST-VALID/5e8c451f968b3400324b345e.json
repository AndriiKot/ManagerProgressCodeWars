    "description": "Input: a string `s` which may contain digits, letters, dashes, spaces, etc...\n\n   We will ignore non-numeric characters.   \n   We calculate a key for that string with the following process:\n   \n    - Write down the first eight digits (numeric characters) of the string\n       (Other digits than the first eight are ignored), hence an integer N.\n    - Multiply the first digit of N by 3, the second digit by 7 and the third digit by 1 (digits are numbered from the left).\n    - Multiply the fourth digit by 3, the fifth digit by 7 and the sixth digit by 1.\n    - Multiply the seventh digit by 3, the eight digit by 7.\n    - Add these products, say `P`\n    - Find the next multiple of 10 greater than `P` or equal to `P`, call it `A` (If `P` is a multiple of 10 `A` is `P`).\n    - Subtract `P` from `A` to get the key `k`.\n    - Add `k` as the last digit of `N`, hence an integer `M`.\nOutput M.\n\n```\nExample:\ns = \"789-456-;1x256\" hence the number N: 78945612 (only the first eight digits)\nP = 156\nA = 160\nk is 4\nM = 789456124\n```\nIf the string has less than 8 digits we will consider that we have the string \"00000000\".\n```\nExample\ns = \"123x-abcdefgh\"; we consider it as \"00000000\" since there are only 3 digits; N is 0\nP = 0\nA = 0\nk is 0\nM = 0\n```\nNote:\n- Please ask before translating.",
