    "description": "This program runs well but we need to make it more elegant.\nTry to rewrite the code of the function ```factorial``` in way to use  ```recursion```.\n\n```Recursion``` is a technique for iterating over an operation by having a function call itself repeatedly until it arrives at a result.\n\nYou may need to know what is  the factorial of a number https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial\n\nRules:\n\n1-You cannot use looping(for, while, forEach).\n\n2-You can expect just non-negative numbers.\n\nNote: If you find another solution this kata isn't for you, you're  in a higher level.\n\nReturn examples:\n\n```\nfactorial(3)=> 3 x 2 x 1 => 6\n\nfactorial(2)=>2 x 1 => 2\n\nfactorial(0) => 1\n```\n\n",
