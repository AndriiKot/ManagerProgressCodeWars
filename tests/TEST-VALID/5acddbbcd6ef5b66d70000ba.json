    "description": "A friend of mine wants help managing their 'to do list' and I have said we on Codewars can assist. \n\nInput:\nTwo strings will be provided.\nThe first is the existing 'To do list'. \nThe second is a list of the additions and subtractions to be made from that list, indicated with a '-' or '+' sign corresponding to completed and new tasks.\n\nOutput:\nThe output will be an updated 'to do list' in string format.\n\nRequirements:\n- If a completed task was never on the list, ignore it.\n- No repeats on the 'to do list'\n- The new list is to be ordered the same as the original list.\n- New tasks are to be added to the end of the list.\n\nExample:\ntoDoList(\"To do list: make dinner, go for a run, book driving test, call bank, call mum\", \"-make dinner, +go to the doctors, -book driving test\") // \"To do list: go for a run, book driving test, call bank, call mum, go to the doctors\"",
