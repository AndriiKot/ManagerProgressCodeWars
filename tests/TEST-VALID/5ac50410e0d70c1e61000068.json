    "description": "Nickolas and Valerie are lined up at the start of a race. Nickolas is a bit hungover and, frankly, not that fast at the best of times, so Valerie agrees to give him a head-start. It's your job to figure out if Valerie will overtake Nickolas before he reaches the finish line and, if so, how far Nickolas will get before Valerie catches him.\n\nWrite a function called findOvertake, that will take four numbers as inputs: Nickolas' speed (in km/hr) Valerie's speed (in km/hr) the head-start that Valerie will give Nickolas (in seconds) and the total race distance (in metres). All of these inputs can be integers or decimals. Nickolas' speed, Valerie's speed and the race distance will always be positive. The head-start can be positive or 0. \n\nYour function should return the distance into the race, in metres, at which Valerie will catch Nickolas, rounded down to the nearest metre. \n\n<strong>SPECIAL CASES</strong>\n<ul>\n  <li>If Valerie won't catch Nickolas, your function should return 'no overtake'.</li>\n  <li>If the race will be a draw, your function should also return 'no overtake'.</li>\n  <li>If Valerie leads from the very start, you should return 0 as she effectively overtakes him at the start line.</li>\n</ul>\n\nFor simplicity, you can assume that each runner has a rolling start (i.e. they're already at their top speed when they cross the start line) and runs at a constant speed throughout the race.\n\nOn your marks, set, GO!\n\n\n",
