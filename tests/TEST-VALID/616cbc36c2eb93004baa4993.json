    "description": "Find the nearest exit in the maze!\n\n- '0' is an empty space, but 'X' is an impassable wall. \n- You can move up, down, left, or right.\n- An exit is an empty space on any of the 4 edges of the maze. \n- You cannot visit a space you have already been to. \n- The starting space does not count as an exit.\n- Coordinates are given as `[row_index, column_index]`.\n- If multiple exits are nearest, return just one exit—it doesn't matter which one.\n- If no valid exit exists, return nil.\n\nThe result should be `[row, col]` coordinates of the nearest exit, or `nil` if no exit could be found.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n0 0 X X\nX 0 X 0\nX 0 X 0\n```\nIf the starting position is `[2,1]`, then the nearest exit will be `[0,1]`.\n\nIf the starting position is `[0,1]`, then the nearest exit will be `[0,0]`.\n\nIf the starting position is `[1,1]`, then the nearest exit will be either `[0,0]` or `[2,1]`.\n\n",
