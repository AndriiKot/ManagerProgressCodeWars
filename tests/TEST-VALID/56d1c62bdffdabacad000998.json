    "description": "In the parallel universe of Mocks, The Mockcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences organizes every year the Mosckars awards , a glamorous ceremony where a number of actress and actors receive awards in different cinema categories.   We will just focus on the Best Actor in a leading role category which is the least important for the Mockians.\n\nThere is a list of five candidates to win the award in each category, and only one candidate win the award, the other 4 suffering the humiliation of smiling as if they did not care whilst hundres of cameras are focused upon them. \n\nThe Mockians are lazy and unsocial, so there are not voters to determine the winner.  Instead they use prison inmates condemned to penal servitude to calculate it, using convoluted formulas that are public but nobody understand, thus creating the effect that the result is completely justified and fair.\n\nThe rules to elect Mosckars winners are:\n\t\n\t- The candidates are ordered in a list by alphabetic order of their surnames, i.e. \n  (Eddie Bluemayne,Bryan Cransmock, Matt Deamon,Michael Fussbender, Leotardo TriCaprio)\n\t\n\t- The general rule is that the digits of the current year are raised to the third power \n  and sum together, then they start to count from 0 to the calculated number, going back from the last element of the list to the initial\n  one over and over as required.  For example, if the calculation of the year is 6, then Bryan Cransmock will win that year´s Mockaward.\n\t\n\t- There is a list of exceptions to the rule to ensure a bit of excitement and drama in the ceremony:\n\t\n\t\t○ The actor \"Silveltre Istalonne\" will never win the award, regardless of the previous rule. \n    If by any tiny chance he is nominated and calculated as the winner, automatically  the next actor in the list wins it,\n    (or the first one of the list if Silveltre is located last in the list).  This is because of a conspiration\n    of the Arnold Twice-enager lobby group and always causes great drama and deligth in the audience, \n    as Mr. Istalonne can´t feel his legs.\n\t\t\n\t\t○ If the actor \"Paco Martinez Soria\" is nominated, he always win the Mosckar.  That causes \n    great elation in the audience as they recognise Paco as world best actor ever, and remember his unforgettable\n    performance in \"La ciudad no es para mí\" with tears in their eyes.\n\t\t\n\t\t○ The Mockians provide a list with nominees which are in the right format, i.e. each\n    candidate is a name with at least two words, in the format \"first_name last_name\".  They consider\n    the last separated word in the name as the last name. For example, in legendary actor \"Paco Martinez Soria\", Soria\n    would be the last name.  Also less popular actor \"Betricio del Tolo\" surname is \"Tolo\".\n\t\t\n\t\t○ Mockians are very absent-minded so in many cases and don´t check how many nominees\n    they provide for an award. In some cases they don´t even provide a single name!  When prisoners ask\n    what year is it to make the calculations, Mockians provide strange things which do not qualify\n    as year, (an acceptable Mockian year is between 0 and 9999 both inclusive).  In all these situations, prisoners grin from ear\n    to ear and instantly provide as winner  \"Paco Martinez Soria\".  Mockians are flabbergasted and don´t understand how\n    they finish calculations so quickly in some occassions.  If they knew...\nFinally Mockians do not care much about spelling, so they don´t care about the standard convention of using capital letters for the first letter of the names, and remaining in lowcases, but they punish the prisoners expecting the right spelling for the winner.\n\t\n  Your Mission\n\t\t\n\tAs a Mocking Rights activist in order to avoid suffering for Mock prisoners\n  \n  implement a funcion \"winner_is\" which takes a list of nominees and the year of the Mockaward, and returns the winner as a string, based on the above rules.\n  \n  Winners names' should be treated with respect and should be provided in the format \"First Name (Any Middle Names If Any) Last Name\"\n  (only first letters of names capitalized).\n  \nThat will put an end to the horrible torture of prisoners calculating cubes of numbers and counting names over and over again… Their destiny is in your hands, do the mock thing.  Mock luck.\n",
