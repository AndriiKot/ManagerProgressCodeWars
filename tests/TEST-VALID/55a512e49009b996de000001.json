    "description": "Story\n-----\n\nEveryday on the way home Jacob finds himself in a trafic jam, which caps his speed on his way home.\n\nCan you help Jacob calculate how long it will take for him to get home with all this traffic around?\n\nTask\n----\n\nYour job is to write a function that accepts 3 arguments:\n\n- traffic speed (`trafficSpeed` in km/hr)\n- Jacob's max speed (`jacobSpeed` in km/hr)\n- distance (`dist` in km)\n\nIf the traffic speed is less then Jacob's speed then Jacob can only move at the traffic speed. Otherwise Jacob can move at his maximum potential speed.\n\nThe function should return amount of hours that it will take Jacob to make his way home.\n\nAll three arguments are integers greater than 0.",
