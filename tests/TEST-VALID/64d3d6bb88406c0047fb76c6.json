    "description": "    Split a string into two lines by balancing the words.\n\n     Given a string that contains words separated by spaces, we want to obtain another string balanced by the words on two lines.\n     The resulting string will contain the same words in the same order but will be divided into two lines by the '\\n' character.\n\n     - The initial string will contain at least two words, otherwise an empty string will be returned.\n     - Words are separated by a single space.\n     - Words cannot be split.\n     - Periods and commas are considered part of words.\n     - The difference in length between the two lines should be the minimum possible.\n     - In case of conflict or doubt, the first line will be the longest.\n\n    Examples (input --> output)\n      - \"Lorem ipsum\" --> \"Lorem\\nipsum\"\n      - \"dolor sit\" --> \"dolor\\nsit\"\n      - \"Lorem ipsum dolor\" --> \"Lorem ipsum\\ndolor\"",
