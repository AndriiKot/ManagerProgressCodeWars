    "description": "<p>Mike went to buy some Sausage Rolls from the local supermarket, he did not realise that these Sausages Rolls all go out the next day! <br>\nMike must eat as many Sausage Roles as he can before midnight (00:00). Your task is to work out how many Sausage Rolls he is not able to eat.</p>\n\n\nYou will be given 3 inputs: <br>\n**Bought**: The number of Sausage Rolls Mike bought origionally <br>\n**Time**: The current time (Hours : Minutes) as a String<br>\n**Rate**: How many Sausage Rolls per Minute can Mike eat (He's a very good eater)\n\n```Example: Bought = 2000, Time = \"18:20\", Rate: 0.5```\n\n```\nThere are 5 Hours and 40 Minutes left until 00:00 - This is 340 Minutes\nEating 0.5 Rolls per minute will mean he eats 170 rolls\n```\n\nAfter this disappointing effort, there are 1830 rolls wasted. \n\n\nA few things to note: <br>\nIf he is part way through a roll as the clock strikes midnight, we will count that as wasted as he has not managed to eat the hole thing. <br>\nThe day starts at 00:01 and ends at 00:00\n\n\n\n\n",
