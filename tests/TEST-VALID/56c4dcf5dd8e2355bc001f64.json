    "description": "This Kata gives you a very simple introduction to the factory design pattern. For a programmer it is very useful to know about design patterns. Specially when you code not alone. When you are writing new code the knowledge about design patterns helps you to name your classes and methods so that other programmers can understand your code better. If you use or change existing code the different class names are talking to you.\n\nSo now it is your turn to get to know about the factory pattern.\n\nThe factory pattern is used to create objects without knowing the class or using \"new\". So first you have classes which are going to be used. Then there is one class which is called \"factory\", which returns the object of a class.\n\nIn this case you are going to provide a factory for text-tools. For every tool you have to write a class with a `use` method and a `name` property.\n\nTo create an object of a text-tool you need to write a factory class with a `makeTool` method which will return the tool object.\n\nUse the test cases as a specification for your factory and the other class definitions. The tests are giving you also an example how to use that pattern. \n\nRead more about the factory design pattern at wikipedia:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern\n\n\n",
