    "description": "A couple is looking for a new apartment in a building that has <b>20 floors</b>. But the real estate agent only told them the rent of the apartment on the top floor. And said that the <b>cost of apartment increases 200$ for each floor as we move down.</b>\n\nFor example: if the rent on 20<sup>th</sup> floor is 1000$ then rent on 19<sup>th</sup> will be 1200$, 18<sup>th</sup> floor will be 1400$ and so on...\n\nMake a function which on providing the top floor price and desired floor, returns the rent on desired floor.\n\n(The FloorWanted (f) is between 1 and 20  and values passed in rent (r) will be always be non-negative and valid, so you don't have to check for that)\n\n<i>*Note that our building follows US English Floor counting ie. bottommost floor is First floor not ground floor. https://images.app.goo.gl/MKExuaL29Aacyife7 </i>\n\n\n<h4>Examples:</h4>\n\n    floor_rent(1000, 5) --> '4000 Dollars'\n    floor_rent(850, 11) --> '2650 Dollars'\n    floor_rent(500, 7) --> '3100 Dollars'\n                     \n                     \n                     ",
