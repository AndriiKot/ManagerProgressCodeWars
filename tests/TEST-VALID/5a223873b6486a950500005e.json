    "description": "It's almost the New Year, so time to make that New Year's Resolution!  You and your friends have been talking about taking classes at the gym.  Bikram Yoga was a bit too intense, so you want to cool things out by taking a regular yoga class.  That Zumba class also seemed pretty exciting! You all agree 2 gym courses for the year will suffice and excitedly head over to the local gym.\n\nNone of you have gym memberships yet, but currently there is a good promotion going on for free classes with a monthly gym commitment. Check out their rates with the schedule below and figure out the total cost for each tier of membership.\n\n```\nmonths\t  rate ($)\t  # of free classes \n1\t        40\t        2\n3\t        35\t        7\n6\t        25\t        11\n9\t        22\t        15\n12\t       20\t        20\n\n```\n\nCurrently, all gym courses on offer are $15 a class, twice a week, for 6 weeks.  Without any discounts, that would make the grand total of $360 for the 2 full courses.",
