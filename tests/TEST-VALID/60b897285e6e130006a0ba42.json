    "description": "You've trained your dog to do one simple instruction: compare two boots and switch them in places (if necessary) so the biggest shoe is closer to the front door.\n\nThat's astounding, but you want more - all boots to be sorted every time you bring the dog to your house, independently of the initial boots order and with out you monitoring the dog.\n\nAll boots of yours stand on numbered tiles and you are sure that you can train the dog to do several instructions in a row (unconditionally), you just need to figure out what those instructions must be and to point to the right tiles in the right order.\n\n# Task\n\nYour task is to create a function `instr_gen(n)`, which will help you to figure out the set of ordering instructions for any `n`, so all `n` shoes are guarantied to be sorted. An ordering instruction is nothing else but a pair of places to order two shoes on them.\n\nFor example, if `n = 3` then the following instructions will work: \n\n     [(0,1), (0,2), (1,2)]\nthe first two instructions put the smallest shoe to the tile#0 and the last instruction orders the rest of the shoes.\n     \n\nIt's not hard to construct a working set of instructions. Thereby your main task will be to optimize it in order to make the sorting procedure as fast as possible. (Making dog to learn instructions is not easy!)\n\n# Input\n\n* You are given an integer number `n` — number of elements in the list, which you'll need to sort. You can expect `2 ≤ n ≤ 512`\n\n# Output\n\n* The output should be a list of instructions: `[(i0, j0), (i1, j1), (i2, j2), ... ]`\n* Each instruction should be a tuple or a list in the format `(i, j)`, where `i` and `j` are indices of the elements, which need to be ordered. After ordering the smallest element will be placed under index `i` and the largest at `j`\n* Indices start at 0 and must satisfy: `0 ≤ i < n`\n\n* The number of instructions must be optimized: \n  * for `n ≤ 8` — it must be the smallest possible (tests will tell you when it is not); \n  * for `n > 8`  — it must not exceed    3.5 &#183; n &#183; log<sup>2</sup>(n). \n\n# Sorting\n\nSorting in the tests will be done with the following procedure, where `instr` is the instruction list generated by `instr_gen(n)` function and `sample` is a list to be sorted. `len(sample) = n`.\n\nAny possible list of lenght `n` must be fully sorted with this function, but you can assume all list elements to be unsigned integers.\n\n```\ndef sort(instr, shoes):\n    for i, j in instr:\n        si = shoes[i]\n        sj = shoes[j]\n        shoes[i] = min(si, sj)\n        shoes[j] = max(si, sj)\n```\nthe function is preloaded and can be used in your solution.\n\n\n\nGood Luck!",
