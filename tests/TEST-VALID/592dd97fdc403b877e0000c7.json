    "description": "In BASH there's a simple, yet a powerful feature, called the wildcards. In this first iteration of the problem, we will tackle the most basic of all wildcards in BASH, - the question mark `?` wildcard.\n\nSo when does this all get used? Whenever searching for a file, sometimes you might be interested in matching a set of files based on their name, for example given a list of files:\n\n```\n- aa.jpg\n- ab.jpg\n- ac.jpg\n- za.jpg\n- zb.jpg\n```\n\nWe might be interested in selecting all the files starting with an `a` character, such as: `aa.jpg`, `ab.jpg` and `ac.jpg`. For this particular case, we would use: `a?.jpg`, to get the desired result.\n\nThe question mark wildcard `?` is very similar in its behavior to the `.` in Regexp, that is, it matches any character as long as its there. For example, `.?` will match `.a` and `._`, but not `a` and not `.`. This effectively implies that the pattern length should equal the length of the matched string.\n\nThe question mark wildcard `?` can be used in a pattern as many times as necessary. For example, `?b?.gif` or `???.elf` or even `????`.\n\nGiven a string `pattern` representing the pattern that may or may not contain wildcards, and a string `filename`, return a truthy value if the given pattern matches the filename, or a falsy value, if it doesn't.\n\nIf you have any questions and or suggestions regarding the task, please feel free to write in the discussions. Have fun!",
