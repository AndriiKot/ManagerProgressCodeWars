    "description": "You have just been hired as a developer for CodeWars Airline - congratulations!\n\nThe airline's maiden voyage, CWA001, has attracted a fair amount of enthusiasm, and a few people have even pre-booked their tickets. Unfortunately, the previous developer was a bit lazy, and kept track of the seat bookings by storing them in a string of booked seats in the following format:\n\n\"1A 3B 5D 11J 3D\" etc.\n\nManagement would like to know which seats are still available for sale.\n\nWrite a function that returns an array of available seats when given the following parameters:\n\n- number of rows \"n\"\n- string of existing reservations \"s\"",
