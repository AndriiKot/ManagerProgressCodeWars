    "description": "2nd in a series of sudoku solvers for ruby, in this kata you will be faced with slightly harder puzzles.\n\nThe examples should always have paths to be followed where there is only one gap in at least one row or column so you shouldn't need to worry about the blocks of 9 at the moment. The initial puzzle will be given as a multidimensional array of integers and must be returned in the same format. \n\nFor more on the rules;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku\n\nGood luck!",
