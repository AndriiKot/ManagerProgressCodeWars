    "description": "Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular graph traversal algorithm used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph. It is particularly useful in navigation systems, network routing, and various other applications.\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm*\n\nYour task is to implement the `dijkstra_path_finder` algorithm function that takes a weighted graph, a start node, and an end node as input. The function should return the shortest path from the start node to the end node, along with its total cost.\n\nExample:\n\n\n## Input:\n```\ngraph = {\n    'A': {'B': 5, 'C': 2},\n    'B': {'A': 5, 'C': 1, 'D': 3},\n    'C': {'A': 2, 'B': 1, 'D': 2},\n    'D': {'B': 3, 'C': 2, 'E': 4},\n    'E': {'D': 4}\n}\nstart_node = 'A'\nend_node = 'E'\n```\n## Output:\n```\nShortest path from A to E: ['A', 'C', 'D', 'E']\nTotal cost: 8\n```\nNote:\n- The graph is represented as a dictionary, where each key represents a node, and the corresponding value is another dictionary containing the neighboring nodes as keys and their edge weights as values.\n- In the given example, node 'A' is connected to node 'B' with an edge weight of 5, and to node 'C' with an edge weight of 2.",
