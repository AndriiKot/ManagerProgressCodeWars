    "description": "We all know the quadratic formula, which solves a second degree polynomial...\n\nbut what about third degree (cubic) polynomials?\n\nJust as we do with the quadratic formula, we are trying to find the REAL roots of cubic polynomials. This means the roots can be found only by using the our four basic mathematical operations, plus roots, on our coefficients. We are therefore only looking for rational roots, or roots that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers.\n\nTODO: Write a function that can solve a cubic polynomial (given as a string) and return a list of it's REAL factors. No need to include repeats. Round to 2 decimal places. The list should be sorted numerically. If there are no real factors, return None.\n\nFor example:\n\n'x^3+5x^2-2x-24' should return [-4,-3,2]\n\nAs far as conplexity, no need to consider polynomials with coefficients >|100|.\n\nNote: cubic polynomials do NOT need to have x^2, x^1 or x^0 terms\n\nGood luck!\n\nHint: http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~vtkala/2016/S/4B/FactoringCubicPolynomials.pdf",
