    "description": "The following problem is adapted from the George Fox Programming Competition for High Schools (2017, Div 2, Q2).\n\n\nGiven information about a circle and rectangle placed in a graphical user interface (GUI), as well as a mouse-click location, determine whether or not the click was in the circle, the rectangle, both, or neither. \"A click on the edge of a shape is counted as being \"in\" the shape.\" has been added to the description.\n\n\nThe information about the rectangle will be given as the topp-left x and y location, width, and height.\n\n\nThe information about the circle will be given as the top-left x and y location of an imaginary square inscribing (encompassing as closely as possible) the circle, as well as the width of the inscribed square.\n\n\nThe information about the mouse-click will be given as an x and y location.\n\n\nThe screen size will always be 600x600, the top-left corner of the screen will always be (0, 0), x will increase towards the right, and y will increase going down the screen.\n\n\nAll values will be given as integers.",
