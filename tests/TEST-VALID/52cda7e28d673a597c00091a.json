    "description": "Department of Theoretical Computer Science has put out a request for a small tool to help their work.\nBeing true theoretical nerds, they have no real clue how to solve their problem in the real world.\n\nThe problem is, given a mathematical expression the variable names should be identified.\n\nThat is, for \"a+b\" they need [\"a\",\"b\"] returned from the \"unbound\" function.\nAn identifier must appear only once in the output - while preserving order of the first met identifier instance!\n(\"a+b+a\" should return [\"a\",\"b\"]).\n\nNotice, the epression need not be evaluated - they just need the identifiers :-)\n\nAllowed operators are:<pre><code>- No assignment operators are allowed\n- No bitwise operators\n- No comma-operator\n- No operators like \"typeof\", \"new\", \"instanceof\" etc.\n- All javascript arithmetic operators\n- All compare operators\n- Boolean operators, with following conventions: \n    && AND   should be &\n    || OR    should be |\n    !  NOT   should be ~\n</code></pre>\n\nWe do not have to make explicit tests for any of the \"No ...\" cases above.\n\nThat is, all the following expressions must return [\"a\",\"b\"] :\n\n<pre><code>- unbound(\"a+b\")\n- unbound(\"a&b\")\n- unbound(\"a&~b\")\n- unbound(\"a|b\")\n- unbound(\"a|~b\")\n- unbound(\"a===b\")\n- unbound(\"a===~b\")\n\n- unbound(\"x+7+x\")  ==> [\"x\"]\n- unbound(\"Math.PI*rad*rad\")  ==> [\"rad\"]\n- unbound(\"Math.pow(Math.cos(v),2)+Math.pow(Math.sin(v),2)\")  ==> [\"v\"]\n</code></pre>\n\nInput will always be a string but may not be valid mathematical expressions and should throw an exception in that case - such a \"(1+2\".\n",
