    "description": "The purpose of this kata is to demonstrate a very basic mistake you may do in Javascript.  \nSome may say it is quirk but there is an explaination about it.  \nFix the bug and you will see the explaination.\n\nThe function `bug()` is supposed to return a value, but it does not work as expected.  \nYour job is to fix it and make sure the proper value is returned.\n\nGood luck",
