    "description": "<h2>A long time ago in a compiler far, far away....</h2>\n\nWe caught a radio transmission from our new spy ship \"Silent Bob\". This is a prototype with camouflage capability. \nThe crew report a malfunction when activating the camouflage. The scanner and the hyper drive will also be activated.\nFind and fix the error or the ship is lost.\n\n<h2>Notes:</h2>\n\nThe class <code>Scout</code> inherit from the abstract class <code>Ship</code> and implements the function <code>Activate()</code>.\nShip provides a control function called <code>IsActive()</code> for tests.\n\n<h2>Task:</h2>\n\nEach system can be individually activated and deactivated (not part of this kata). Several systems can be activated at the same time. No system may influence another system. How the activation is checked remains hidden from us. More in the test cases.\n\n<h2>May the force be with you!</h2>",
