    "description": "Napolean is planning his next vacation.  Write a program that tells him if he'll have enough water, food, and potty breaks arranged for his pets. The input parameter is an array of numbers -- [#ofDaysGone, #ofWaterBowls, #ofCatFoodBowls, #ofDogFoodBowls, #ofPottyBreaks] -- If the number of items is equal to or more than the amount required for the number of days he is gone, the program should return a list of which categories are deficient. \n\nThe categories are Water, Catfood, Dogfood, and Potty Breaks.\n\nThe dog drinks 2 bowls of water and eats 2 bowls of food per day.\nThe cat drinks 1 bowl of water per day and eats half a bowl of food per day.\nThe dog and cat share the same water bowl; they do not share the same food bowl.\nThey must go outside 3 times per day.\n\nEx1. [1,7,7,7,7] --> [];\nEx2. [3,10,1,1,1] --> ['Catfood', 'Dogfood', 'Potty Breaks']\nEx3. [5,1,1,1,1] --> ['Water', 'Catfood', 'Dogfood', 'Potty Breaks']\n\nThe array will always be 4 numbers.",
