    "description": "Bob and Alice are best friends. \n\nThey also both love cricket! \n\nThis season, they decided to record their scores and calculate the highest average at the end of the season. The scores are recorded in the following format:\n\n`'B10A5B6A10B9A109B55A36'`\n\n```\nThis string denotes the following:\n\nBob: 10\n\nAlice: 5\n\nBob: 6\n\nAlice: 10\n\nBob: 9\n\nAlice: 109\n\nBob: 55\n\nAlice: 36\n```\n\nUsing these scores, Bob's average score is 20 and Alice's average score is 40 and the function should output `'Alice wins with an average of 40'`. \n\nIf the average scores are equal, it should output `'Well played, average scores are equal'`.\n\nAn empty string should return `'No matches this season'`.\n\nThe average should be rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nBob and Alice will always play the same number of matches.\n\nExamples (Input --> Output):\n\n```\n'B10A1B5A1' --> 'Bob wins with an average of 8'\n\n'A1B5A1B10' --> 'Bob wins with an average of 8'\n\n'B1A100B10A100' --> 'Alice wins with an average of 100'\n\n'B6A5B7A5B6A9B1A1' --> 'Well played, average scores are equal'\n\n'' --> 'No matches this season'\n```\n\n",
