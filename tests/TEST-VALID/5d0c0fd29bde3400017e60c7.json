    "description": "In this kata you are supposed to program three basic functions: more, less and equal to compare two integers.\n\nThe idea is: you are not allowed to use built-in comparative operators (such as '>', '<', '==', '<=', '>=' and '!=' in Python or in Java). Also you are forbidden to use buit-functions max() and min() and operator module (gt, lt, eq and so on). As you understand, implicit usage of comparative functions is also forbidden.\n\nTry to think like computer does, no cheating (I'll check that).\n\nGood luck to you, warrior! Hope, you enjoy this ;)",
