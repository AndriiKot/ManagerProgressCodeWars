    "description": "This is the inverse Kata to <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/54db15b003e88a6a480000b9\">Moduli Number System</a>.\n<h1>Explanation</h1>\n\nA number system with moduli is deﬁned by a vector of `k` moduli, `[m1,m2, ···,mk]`.\n\nThe moduli must be pairwise co-prime, which means that, for any pair of moduli, the only common factor is `1`.\n\nIn such a system each non-negative number `n` is represented by a string `\"-x1--x2-- ... --xk-\"` of its residues, one for each modulus. For this representation to be unique it is necessary that the product `m1 * ... * mk` must be greater than the number `n`.\n\nFor example, if we use the system `[2, 3, 5]` the number `n = 11` is represented by `\"-1--2--1-\"`, the number `n = 23` by `\"-1--2--3-\"`.\n\nIf we use the system `[8, 7, 5, 3]` the number `n = 187` becomes `\"-3--5--2--1-\"`.\n<h1>Your Task</h1>\n\nYou will be given a string representation `\"-x1--x2-- ...--xk-\"` and a valid moduli system `S = [m1,m2, ···,mk]` and you will have to find the unique non-negative number `n` less than the product of all moduli represented by the string in the system `S`.\n\nThe inputs are always valid: The moduli systems are always pairwise co-prime and the remainders are less than their corresponding modulus.",
