    "description": "This is a test to see how making a kata works. in this example: Write the code for having the functions work based on the test cases. Setting the variable as operations and the functions branch from the operations / options available. \n\nNext step (personal goal) would be to have the program auto-calculate based on a chosen function i.e. Sqrt the number 49, or sum of 2, 3, 5 etc etc. \n",
