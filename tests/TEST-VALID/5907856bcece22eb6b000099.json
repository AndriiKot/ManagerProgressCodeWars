    "description": "You are tasked with breaking the code on a series of locks. The digits on these locks have to be rearranged in a specific way for you to open them. \n\nEach lock can have a varying number of digits (passed to you as a list of arguments) but they are all <u>opened by following the same pattern</u>. Figure out what the pattern is based on the examples below and write a method ```code_break``` which will do the job for you. \n\n```\ncode_break(3)                         => [3]\ncode_break(1,2,3)                     => [3,2,1]\ncode_break(8,5,4)                     => [8,5,4]\ncode_break(9,4,2,7)                   => [9,4,2,7]\ncode_break(2,6,7,4,3)                 => [7,6,2,4,3]\ncode_break(1,2,3,4,5,6)               => [3,2,1,6,5,4]\ncode_break(7,1,1,1,3,5,2)             => [7,1,1,5,3,1,2]\ncode_break(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3)   => [3,2,1,6,5,4,9,8,7,3,2,1]\ncode_break(9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0)       => [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]\ncode_break(8,3,1,3,0,3,0,5,2,0,6)     => [8,3,1,2,5,0,0,6]\ncode_break(1,6,6,2,8,2,3,5,3,5,8,0,7) => [6,6,1,5,8,0,7]\n```\n",
