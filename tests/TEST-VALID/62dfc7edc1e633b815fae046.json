    "description": "For animation and games it's often necessary to project 3D space onto 2D. A simple example if this is choosing one \"light source\" at a certain point in 3D space, and a \"screen\" as a plane at a distance from the light source. Then points in space distinct from the light source can be projected onto the plane.\n\nIn this problem, the light source is given by a 3-vector `light source`, the screen is placed at x-coordinate `screen_x`, and the point to be projected is at the 3-vector `point`.\n\nThe light source is guaranteed to be in the y-z plane so has x-coordinate zero. The screen is guaranteed to be at a positive x-value (and is parallel to the y-z plane, so will always have x-coordinate `screen_x`). The point to be projected is guaranteed to have a non-zero positive x coordinate which is less than the value of `screen_x`.\n\nYour task is to solve the geometric problem of finding the image point on the screen and implementing this in code.\n\nThe image point should be given as a 3-vector of integer coordinates, even though information is lost through rounding, as images will ultimately be pixels with discrete coordinate values. The x-coordinate will always be `screen_x`. The tests assume you will round down, maybe using `int`.",
