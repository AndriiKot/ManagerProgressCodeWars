    "description": "In this challenge, you will be given 2 things:\n\n  1. A list of objects with properties (x,y,id) which resemble tourists\n  \n  2. A List of objects with properties (x,y,id) which resemble landmarks\n\n\nWith this data, you must figure out which of the landmarks have the most amount of tourists in their range.\n\nI have given you a function called `isNearby` which takes a landmark and a person and tells you if they are close enough to be neighbors.\n\nWith this in mind, you must create a function called `mostPopularLandmark` which returns an array containing the landmark with the most tourists and an array containing the tourists that are nearby the landmark.\n\nPreconditions:\n\n  1. Size of tourists array will always be greater than 0\n  \n  2. Size of landmarks array will always be greater than 0\n  \nSome warnings:\n\n  1. Some tourists can be close to multiple landmarks.\n  \n  2. If two landmarks have the same amount of tourists in range, return the landmark that has the smallest id along with its tourists.   \n  ",
