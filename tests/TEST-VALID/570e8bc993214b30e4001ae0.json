    "description": "Stacks and queues. Staples of the computer science curriculum and remarkably useful data structures given their simplicity. They are sets, each with a special rule regarding how elements may be removed. In a stack, only the most recently added item may be removed. In a queue, it is the least recently added. Stacks are last in, first out (LIFO). Queues are first in, first out (FIFO).\n\n**But did you know that a queue can be implemented using two stacks?**\n\nThis problem asks you to do just that.",
