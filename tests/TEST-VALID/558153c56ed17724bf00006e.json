    "description": "You are working on a busy ferry as the lead navigation officer. One day there is a massive storm and many of the instruments on board are rendered useless. The engine is also broken and only has enough power to push the boat at 10mph.\n\nYou know that there is a current taking the boat south at a speed of 3mph, you also have your coordinates var YC = [x,y], and the coordinates of the two closest ports, var port1 = [x,y], var port2 = [x,y], the coordinate grid lines are set out one mile apart. \n\nThe captain decides to take the ferry to the port which can be reached in the shortest amount of time. \n\nWrite a function which will return the appropriate port to travel to, and the time it will take to arrive, rounded to the nearest hour. See the example test cases.\n",
