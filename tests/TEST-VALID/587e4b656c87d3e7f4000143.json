    "description": "# Prime Factors\n\nCompute the prime factors of a given natural number.\n\nA prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.\n\nNote that 1 is not a prime number.\n\n## Example\n\nWhat are the prime factors of 60?\n\n- Our first divisor is 2. 2 goes into 60, leaving 30.\n- 2 goes into 30, leaving 15.\n  - 2 doesn't go cleanly into 15. So let's move on to our next divisor, 3.\n- 3 goes cleanly into 15, leaving 5.\n  - 3 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 4.\n  - 4 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 5.\n- 5 does go cleanly into 5.\n- We're left only with 1, so now, we're done.\n\nOur successful divisors in that computation represent the list of prime\nfactors of 60: 2, 2, 3, and 5.\n\nYou can check this yourself:\n\n- 2 * 2 * 3 * 5\n- = 4 * 15\n- = 60\n- Success!\n\nYou are required to create a function `primeFactors` that takes in a number and returns an array of prime factors.\n\n``` javascript\nprimeFactors(6)\n[2, 3]\n```\n\n## Source\n\nThe Prime Factors Kata by Uncle Bob [http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.ThePrimeFactorsKata](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.ThePrimeFactorsKata)",
