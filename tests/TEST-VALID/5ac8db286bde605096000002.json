    "description": "You are a data analyst at a travel company. Every time a customer books a holiday with your company a new entry is automatically created in your table of bookings. Customers are asked to fill in their phone number and email address when they book. It isn't currently possible to identify if a customer has ever booked before, or even count the number of unique customs.\nYou have been tasked with finding the number of unique customers using customer information and splitting the unique customers in to groups based on the number of holidays they have booked.\n```javascript\n//bookingTable columns titles are [uniqueBookingReference, email, phoneNumber]\nvar bookingTable =   [[1,\"johnsmith99@kata.com\",\"077 7250 4736\"],\n                      [2,\"johnsmith99@kata.com\",\"077 7250 4736\"],\n                      [3,\"johnsmith99@kata.com\",\"077 7250 4736\"],\n                      [4,\"Terry81@kata.com\",\"077 1345 9765\"]];\n                      //Solution should return {'1':1, '3':1}\n                      //i.e. One person has booked once, one person has booked three times.      \n```\nCustomers may not always fill in all the data fields when they make a booking. A repeating customer may use a different email address or phone number when booking. You will need to depduplicate the data based on all of the information available. In the case that there is no user information assume that the customer has only booked once.\n```javascript\nvar bookingTable =   [[1,\"johnsmith99@kata.com\",\"077 7250 4736\"],\n                      [2,\"johnsmith88@codewars.com\",\"077 7250 4736\"],\n                      [3,\"johnsmith88@codewars.com\",null],\n                      [4,\"johnsmith99@kata.com\",null],\n                      [5,null,null],\n                      [6,\"Terry81@kata.com\",\"077 1345 9765\"]];\n                      //Solution should return {'1':2, '4':1}           \n```",
