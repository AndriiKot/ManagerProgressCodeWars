    "description": "In the past, Qiu Chengtong was a guest of Luyu, and the program group arranged several questions in advance. One of them was ```\"1234 => 0```, ```1027 => 1```, ```2069 => 3```, ask ```2471 => ?```\"\n\nQiu Chengtong looked at it for a few seconds and said, \"I can't answer this for the time being.\"\n\nThe audience said in unison: \"```0```\"\n\nThen Chen Luyu said, \"Please ask the child with glasses in front of the auditorium to stand up and tell us why it is zero.\"\n\nThat pupil answered: \"1027 has a 0, hey, it's not a 0, actually it's a circle, and 1234 has no circle, 2069 has three circles, and 2471 has no circle, so it's 0.\"\n\nThen the camera turned to Qiu Chengtong, and he smiled and said, \"Very good, very good.\"\n\nYour task is to write a function named ```cannot_solve_problem``` to solve it.\n\nNote: consider the number ```8``` has two circles.\n",
