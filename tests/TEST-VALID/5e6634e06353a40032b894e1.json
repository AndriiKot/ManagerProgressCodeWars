    "description": "## Description and example:\nA long time ago, in a galaxy not so far away (It's actually the same galaxy), there was a tribe named the Chakitra's that wrote exactly like we're used to nowadays. At least, that was what scientists believed for many, many years. \n\nDr. Ruby von Stiemelberg der siebenundsiebzig found out their language was not what everyone thought it was. He discovered the ancient texts the Chakitra's wrote ONLY contained words where the highest letter had an even index in the alphabet. \"WUNDERBAR!\", he yelled when he found out.\n\nLucky for us, Dr. Ruby von Stiemelberg der siebenundsiebzig was kind enough to give us some examples:\n\n\"The stone fell in the box\" is a sentence he found written on a wall.\n\nThe: 'T' is the highest letter ; index of 'T' = 20 ; 20 is an even number<br>\nstone: 'T' is the highest letter ; index of 'T' = 20 ; 20 is an even number<br>\nfell: 'L' is the highest letter ; index of 'L' = 12 ; 12 is an even number<br>\nin: 'N' is the highest letter ; index of 'N' = 14 ; 14 is an even number<br>\nthe: 'T' is the highest letter ; index of 'T' = 20 ; 20 is an even number<br>\nbox: 'X' is the highest letter ; index of 'X' = 24 ; 24 is an even number<br>\n\nSadly, some vandals recently ruined the ancient walls by writing their own texts on it. \"Wie können sie!\" yelled Dr. Ruby von Stiemelberg der siebenundsiebzig when he found out. It was his duty to find out the real texts.\n\nYour job is to write a function for Dr. Ruby von stiemelberg der siebenundsiebzig, so he doesn't have to do it all manually. Goodluck noble scientist! Or, as Dr. Ruby von stiemelberg der siebenundsiebzig would say: \"Viel Glück edler Wissenschaftler!\"\n\n## What to return:\n\nYou should return True if the sentence is written by the Chakitra's and False if it's written by vandals.\n\n## Good to know:\n\n- My goal is not to trick you. The Chakitra's and the vandals didn't use punctuation, so you don't have to escape those. (You can, if you want.)\n- A = index 1 and Z = index 26\n- The Chakitra's and the vandals ALWAYS use a blank space (\" \") between words.\n- The example test cases contain existing words, the other test cases won't.\n- You have to **return booleans**, **not strings like \"True\" or \"False\"**\n- Dr. Ruby von stiemelberg der siebenundsiebzig will be proud, no matter what happens",
