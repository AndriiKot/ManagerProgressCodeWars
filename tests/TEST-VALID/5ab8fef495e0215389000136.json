    "description": "You are given a number. Your job is to convert into a word. That is : </br>\ngiven `19` convert it into `nineteen`. The numbers are in range of *0 to Infinity*. Seems simple ? I don't know , therefore I added a twist : </br>\nIf the number is `0` instead of `zero` you are goinng to return `Infinity` with capital I. also just for fun , if the number is `23` you will return `birthday`(No reason for this). Negative numbers will return `'0'` as a string. You don't have to worry about decimals for now (atleast..). don't need to worry about words that aren't numbers</br>\nSo go ahead and have fun (or not)</br>\nwrite 32 as `thirty-two`. Same goes for everything other number.  All letters are lower case. Read the examples. \nExamples : </br>\n```javascript\nTest.assertEquals(numToWord(10) , 10); // --> That is 10 is equal to ten\nTest.assertEquals(numToWord(810238903242) , 'eight hundred ten billion two hundred thirty-eight million nine hundred three thousand two hundred forty-two'); // --> You get the idea don't you!\n```\nThere are over 800 tests.
