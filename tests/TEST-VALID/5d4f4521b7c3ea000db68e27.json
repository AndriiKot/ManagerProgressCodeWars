    "description": "# Ask the audience\nLet's imagine that you are a programmer in a team that develops software for a new television show. At one of the meeting, the general producer told you that it is planned to add a new option — hint \"Ask the Audience\", like in the TV-game \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\", but the project budget is not enough to invite a real audience to the show each time.\n\nSo your task is to simulate a virtual voting model!\n# Task\nWrite a function that will return an array containing number of votes for each answer option.  \n# Input\n`votes` - number of voters  \n`options` - number of answer options\n# Ouput\n`[]` - generated sequence of n (`options`) random numbers, the sum of which will be equal to a certain value (`votes`).\n# Examples:\n```python\n# sum and len are variable!\nask_the_audience(100, 4) -> [4, 57, 21, 18] # sum = 100, len = 4\nask_the_audience(50, 2) -> [6, 44] # sum = 50, len = 2\n\n# zero votes for one or more answer options is possible\nask_the_audience(3, 3) -> [0, 2, 1] # sum = 3, len = 3\n\n# numbers in resulting list must be random generated!\nask_the_audience(25, 2) -> [8, 17] # sum = 25, len = 2\nask_the_audience(25, 2) -> [11, 14] # sum = 25, len = 2\n\n# edge cases\nask_the_audience(10, 0) -> []\nask_the_audience(10, 1) -> [10]\nask_the_audience(0, 3) -> [0, 0, 0]\nask_the_audience(1, 2) -> [1, 0]\n```  \n# Notes and some edge cases\n* `votes` and `options` can be any integers greater than or equal to `0`\n* The length of the returned list must be equal to `options` (if there are no votes for any option, then it should be `0`)\n* The sum of the returned list must be equal to `votes` (each voter must vote once)\n* If `options` is `0`, then the expected result is `[]` (no voting)\n* If `options` is `1`, then the expected result is `[votes]` (all votes for one option)\n* If `votes` is `0`, then the expected result is `[0, 0, ...]` (all options without votes)\n* If `votes` is `1`, then the expected result is `[0, 1, ...]` (one vote for any one of the options)\n* Voting results must be random! Do not specifically prioritize any option. Indexes of min/max in resulting array should not always be the same\n* On a large amount of test iterations, the number of votes for each option should tend to `votes / options`. Allowed `+/-20%` from that value on 1000+ iterations.",
