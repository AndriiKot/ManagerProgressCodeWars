    "description": "Bill & Bob chat a lot but they don’t want people to understand what they’re talking about. So they have created a secret language where they reverse each word in a sentence as well as reversing the sentence itself!\n\nThey also add \"#\" at the start and the end of the sentence so they know it's the secret language.\n\nFor example: \n-> Hello this is me = #em si siht olleH#,\n \n-> Bye! = #!eyB#\n\nUnfortunately Bob is a very lazy man and needs someone to convert sentences into their secret language. \n\nPlease help Bob in constructing his secret conversations with Bill! \n",
