    "description": "The story: Your friend just moved to a new country, and got a new job. Your friend rides the train to the company every day. However, the station prints train seats in a hard to understand format.\n\nHaving moved over with your friend, you decide to help him write a decoder, using your strong logic and interpreting skills.\n\nThe ticket is always formatted in car-row(seat). This isn't really readable, so you'd convert it to a readable format.\n\nIn each row, Seat A is the left window,\n\nB is the left aisle,\n\nC is the right aisle,\n\nD is the right window.\n\nSo, a seat at car 4 row 12 seat B, the input would be ```4-12(B)```. The output would be expected to be ```Car 4 Row 12 Left Aisle```\n\nAll inputs are valid. No need for test of invalid inputs.",
