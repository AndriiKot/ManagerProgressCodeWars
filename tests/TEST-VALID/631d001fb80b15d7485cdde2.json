    "description": "### Set-up\nYou are the commander of an Ancient Greek army! You are currently at war - your job is to hold off the enemy troops while you await reinforcements. \n### Availible Forces\nYour units consist of highly trained **hoplites**, which will help you defend  against the opponents **slingers** and **chariots**. For the purpose of the kata, all units has the exact same fighting quality, so numbers and type of unit is all you have to worry about.\n### Example Battles\nThe following units are perfectly matched in battle:\n\n- **2**  hoplites = **1** slinger and **2** chariots\n- **6**  hoplites = **6** slingers and **4** chariots\n\n### Strategy\nReturn the amount of `hoplites` you need to match the given `chariots ` and `slingers` \n  \n*p.s Don't defeat them yet; reinforcements are arriving to do that later.*\n\n\n",
