    "description": "An oft-used approximation of π is 22/7 which is only accurate to two decimal places. We can improve this by using fractions with larger numerators and denominators, for instance, 333/106 is accurate to four decimal places.\n\nGiven a positive real number `x` and positive integer `n`, find the fraction `a / b` that is closest to `x` where `a` and `b` are at most `n`. The fraction should be reduced and returned as a tuple `(a, b)`.\n\n# Inputs\n\n* 0.0 < x ≤ 1,000.0\n* 0 < n ≤ 1,000,000",
