    "description": "In mathematics, a [polynomial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial) is an expression consisting of variables (or indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents.\n\nIn this kata, you have to add some members to the given `Poly` class. \nPolynomials are stored internally using an array of `Double` values that represent the polynomial's coefficients. \n\nFor example:\n\nThe array `[1,2,3,5]` represents the polynomial: 1x<sup>0</sup> + 2x<sup>1</sup> + 3x<sup>2</sup> + 5x<sup>3</sup> or more simply 1 + 2x + 3x<sup>2</sup> + 5x<sup>3</sup>.\n\nAs you can see in the initial solution, the constructor takes a list of coefficients. \n\nHowever, trailing zeros aren't really necessary when one evaluates the polynomial, so your first task is to eliminate all the trailing zero coefficients by implementing `trimTrailingZeroCoefficients()`.\n\nFor example an array like `[0,1,0,0,0,0]` should be reduced to `[0,1]`. The coefficient array cannot be empty and has to be able to represent the zero polynomial.\n\nYour next task is to implement `evaluatePoly(x)`, which evaluates the polynomial at the point `x`.\n\nYour last task is to find the root of the polynomial in the interval `(a,b)`, i.e. the point `x` such that `evaluatePoly(x)` is close to zero (close means: if the root is `r` then all values between `[r-epsilon,r+epsilon]` are accepted. epsilon lies in the interval `[0.0005,0.001]`). \n\n**Note:** When defining intervals parentheses `()` indicate a value is not included in the interval, while square brackets `[]` indicate they are.  For example: (1,3) Include all the values between 1 and 3, but not 1 and not 3. So `1.0000000001` is in the interval but `1.0000000000` is not!  By comparison [1,3] includes all values between 1 and 3 including `1.0000000000`, `1.0000000001`, `2.9999999999`, and `3.0000000000`.\n\nIn all test cases the root lies inside the interval and in particular that `f(a) > 0` and `f(b) < 0` with only one root in the interval.\n\nIf you get stuck on the last task, have a look at this [hint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method\").\n",
