    "description": "You're a self-employed fisherman off the coast of Alaska but your yearly fishing licence has expired. You want to know if it's worth while having it renewed. \n\nYou know that you can make $10,000 a year per each square mile of fishing ground that you have the rights to. \n\nThe fishing licence qualifies you to fish within 3 given points of a triangle. \n\nIn order to be profitable, the fishing licence can't be more than 30% of your turn-over.\n\n## Input\n\n * The `points` will be given to you in the form of a 2d array of signed integers - ```[[x1,y1], [x2,y2], [x3,y3]]```. All triangles will be valid and right angled.\n * The `price`: price of renewing fishing licence.\n\n\n## Output\nYou should write a function `profitCheck` takes two above arguments and returns whether it is profitable or not to renew your licence.\nIf you can make a profit, return \"It's a deal!\"\nIf not, return \"No thanks!\"\n\n\n\n## Example\n`profitCheck([[0, 0], [0, 4], [3, 0]], 30000) == \"No thanks!` becase 6 square mile fishing ground is worth only $60,000 yearly.\n",
