    "description": "This is Bug Problem #3 out of a series of Bug problems made by CalvinatorIA! These problems basically give you code to fix due to the bugs in it, and you have to fix it. Go squash those bugs!\n\nStory: Bob saw how much fun coding is despite its difficultly, and started programming himself. He is trying to make a program that can count how much money he has after his taxes and payments per month, but he is having some trouble making it! Can you help him?\n\nHints:\n - Read the code carefully, very carefully.\n - Look for very minute errors in the code.\n - If you delete something, remember to keep what the original is trying to exucute.\n - In this exercise, the money should not be rounded to cents. Just keep it as plain money.",
