    "description": "Can you read this string? \n\n> \"thedogchacedthecat\"\n\nHow about this one? \n\n> \"thisisanawesomekata\"\n\nWell, most likely you can because your brain reads it as \"the dog chaced the cat\" and \"this is an awesome kata\".\n\nHow does your brain do that?\n\nWell, we don't really know but we do know how to make a computer solve this!\n\nWrite a function `space_sentence` which gets as an input a non-spaced string `s` and a vocabolary set `vocab` and returns ALL the valid spaced sentences (valid means all words are in vocabulary) as a set. If no valid sentence exists, return an empty set.\n\nAssume that both the input and word in the vocabulary are lower case.\n",
