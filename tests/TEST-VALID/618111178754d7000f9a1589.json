    "description": "Let's play a game of word prediction. The user starts typing a word on the keyboard and at some point stops. At this point, you try to guess what word he means. You do this by creating a function. The user can type predefined words from the dictionary, which is the first argument of the function. The dictionary is sorted alphabetically. A word partially parsed by the user is the second argument of the function. The user can also type special characters not included in the dictionary.\n\nIf the user's intended word cannot be predicted by the dictionary, the function returns an empty table. If the user has not entered even one letter, the function returns an empty table. If it is possible to consider that a word is complete and/or other unfinished words, the function returns a table with all these possible words.",
