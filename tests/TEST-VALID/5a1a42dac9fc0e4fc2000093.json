    "description": "You are out for a catch up luncheon with some pals who happen to be vegetarian.  It doesn't really bother you they don't eat meat, but you want to accomodate their preference of abstaining from it. You ask the waitperson for that day's recommendations, and request for them to kindly substitute tofu for meat on whatever dish they recommend. \n\nIf the dish contains no meat, you will take it as is.  The range of meats on offer at this restaurant are only: chicken, beef, lamb and pork.  Please write a function transforming all dish possibilities into a vegetarian-friendly choice. \n\n```\nie: vegetize('cauliflower', 'lentils', 'pork', 'cranberries');\n    returns('cauliflower', 'lentils', 'tofu', 'cranberries');\n```",
