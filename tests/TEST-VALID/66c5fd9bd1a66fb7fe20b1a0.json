    "description": "Welcome to the Dollar Auction!\n\nThis auction is like any other auction. Individuals bid sequentially on an item and the highest bidder pays and wins the auction. However, there is one glaring exception: The second highest bidder also pays their bid but loses the auction.\n\nAll you have to do is, given the value of the item and bids, determine whether the seller is going to make a profit or not.\n\nFor context, all bids will be non-zero distinct positive integers that are <b>strictly increasing</b> (the next bid is guaranteed to be larger than the previous bid). Value is a non-zero positive integer.\n\nYou can assume that the seller will receive the top two bid prices in full. \n\nMore information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction",
