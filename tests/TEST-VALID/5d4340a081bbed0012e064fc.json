    "description": "Comrade,\n\nWelcome.... You looked taller in the picture.... anyways...\n\nToday we will be solving a problem I have not quite been able to wrap my head around.\nIf you inspect the terminal here  you will see the machine is intaking 4 variables.\n\nc, s , g , p\n\nThese variables correspond to incoming shipment containers and we need to calculate our companies super specific metric know as the odic value to each shipment.\n\nEach incoming shipment container will have  1 <= n <= 99 units of each.\n\nThose variables are then put through a calculation and an final output number (odic value) is returned.\n\nYour job is to find out the process behind the calculation so we can accurately measure each incoming shipment and assertain the odic value.\n\nBe sure to take into accout all <strong>elements</strong> of the problem.\nAll number values in the calculation should be rounded down to the nearest whole number.\n\nExample : \n107.868 => 107\n\n\nGood luck comrade.\n\n\n",
