    "description": "# Reducing arrays\nSometimes we need to perform an operation on more than one item in the array at the same time. For example, let's say we need to find the largest integer in an array. We can't use a `filter()` operation, because it only examines one item at a time. To find the largest integer we need to compare items in the array to each other.\n\nOne approach could be to select an item in the array as the assumed largest number (perhaps the first item), and then compare that value to every other item in the array. Each time we come across a number that was larger than our assumed largest number, we'd replace it with the larger value, and continue the process until the entire array was traversed.\n\n## reduce operator\nIf we replaced the specific size comparison with a closure, we could write a function that handled the array traversal process for us. At each step our function would apply the closure to the last value and the current value and use the result as the last value the next time. Finally we'd be left with only one value. This process is known as reducing because we reduce many values to a single value.\n\nLet's add a `reduce()` function to the Array type, which perform reductions on arrays.\n\nUse this new function to implement `getHighestRating()`, which isolates the highest rating in a rray of ratings. Similarily, implement `getLargestBoxartUrl()` by a combination of `reduce()` and `map()` which reduces mutiple boxart objects to a single value: the url of the largest box art.\n\n## Reducing with an initial value\nSometimes when we reduce an array, we want the reduced value to be a different type than the items stored in the array. Implement a `getVideoMap()` function which can reduce  an array of videos and into a single map where the key is the video id and the value is the video's title.\n\n## Note: Attribution\nThis kata is part of a series on functional programming in JS/TS.
