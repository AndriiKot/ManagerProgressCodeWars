    "description": "Create the function `h(lhs, operation, rhs)` that performs an arithmetic calculation\n\n`lhs` and `rhs` are positive integers representing the left-hand and right-hand side of the operation \n\n`operation` is a number representing the arithmetic operation used. 1 stands for addition, 2 for multiplication, 3 for exponentiation. You can think of what bigger numbers represent. Your code should handle operations at least untill 5. can you came up with a general unbounded solution?\n\nRestrictions: You cant use any of this operators `+ *`. The usage of `-` is restricted to maximal two.\n\n\nCodegolf\nYoure code need to have not more than 100 characters. Whitespaces and newlines are not counted, you can have them as much as you want.",
