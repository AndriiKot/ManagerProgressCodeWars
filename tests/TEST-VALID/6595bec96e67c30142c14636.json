    "description": "**Problem: Enigmatic Cipher**\n\nLegend speaks of an enigmatic cipher used by ancient scholars. Within the ruins of an ancient temple, inscriptions were discovered. These inscriptions contain a string with various symbols representing both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The task is to uncover the secret code embedded within this string.\n\nYour task is to create a function `maxCipherDifference` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the maximum difference in positions between any two identical alphabetical characters (both uppercase and lowercase) in the string. However, for this cipher, consider the distance to be the absolute difference between positions and not just the direct subtraction.\n\nExamples:\n```lua\nmaxCipherDifference(\"XyZ123xyz\") -- Output: 6 (9 - 3)\nmaxCipherDifference(\"AbC123\") -- Output: -1 (no repeated alphabetical characters)\nmaxCipherDifference(\"a\") -- Output: -1 (only one occurrence of an alphabetical character)\nmaxCipherDifference(\"Hello World!\") -- Output: 7 (10 - 3)\n```\nConsider both uppercase and lowercase alphabetical characters for finding the maximum absolute difference in their positions. Return -1 if there's no repeated alphabetical character in the string or if there's only one occurrence of an alphabetical character.",
