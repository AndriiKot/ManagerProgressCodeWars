Accept 2 integers between 0-9.\n<br>2. Create 2 arrays that count up from 0 to their respective integer.\n<br>3. Create an object that can store both arrays.\n<br>4. Add both arrays as properties to that object.\n<br>4. Multiply each of the first array items by 17.\n<br>5. Multiply each of the second array items by 13.\n<br>6. Return the length of the longer array as an integer.\n<br>7. If both arrays are equal in length, it doesn't matter which one is returned.\n\nI've given this matter a lot of thought and I think this is the best way to go about it, but if you find a better way that recieves 2 integers and outputs the same result - by all means go for it.\n\nAll the best,\nO.C\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
