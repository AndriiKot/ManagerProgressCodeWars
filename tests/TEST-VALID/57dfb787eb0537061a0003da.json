    "description": "Hi! I present you Chrono, a not-so-clever watchmaker.\n\nHe's got a problem: he can't remember the correct clock hands positions.\n\nLet me explain: both hands can point to 360 different positions, not only the 60 drawn on the clock face. And the position of the hour hand it's determined by the position of the minute hand.\n\nEg: if the clock it's pointing `02:30`, while the minute hand points exactly the 30th minute, the hour hand points between the `2` and `3` signs, not exactly the `2`.\n\nSo, Chrono needs a function that given the hands degrees, returns `False` if the positions are wrong, and the time if they are correct.\n\nThe time format goes from `00:00` to `11:59`\n\nNOTE: every minute contains 6 degrees => `360 / 60 = 6`. And every degree must be rounded to the lowest multiple of 6: `5 => 0 = 0 minutes`, `8 => 6 = 1 minute` and `15 => 12 = 2 minute`",
