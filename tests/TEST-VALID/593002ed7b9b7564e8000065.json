Should be in lower case</p>\n<p><b>Word format</b> - Both input and output shall be in the format <code>123.19 = one hundred and twenty three point one nine</code>. No hyphen is needed in numbers 21-99. Words should also be separated with one space and no space padding is allowed. Words after the decimal point should be spelt out one by one (e.g. <code>0.19 = zero point one nine</code> not <code>zero point nineteen</code>)</p>",
