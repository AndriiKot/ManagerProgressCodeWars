    "description": "You are given an array of positive integers and a value `k.` Your task is to perform division operations on the array elements while minimizing their sum. For each division operation, you can select any number from the array and divide it by 2, but you lose 1 unit of `k` every time you perform this operation. Take into account that `k` cannot be less than 0; you must finish the program when `k` is 0, returning the sum of all the elements in the array.\n\nWrite a function `minimizeSum(nums, k)` that takes an array `nums` of positive integers and an integer `k` as parameters and returns the minimized sum achievable by performing the division operations.\n\nExamples:\n\n`minimizeSum([8, 10, 4], 2)` => `13`\nExplanation: Divide 10 by 2 (now k = 1 and resulting array = [8, 5, 4]), divide 8 by 2 (now k = 0) with the resulting array: [4, 5, 4]\nSum of the array: 5 + 4 + 4 = 13\n\n`minimizeSum([16, 12, 8, 6], 4)` => `20`\nExplanation: Divide 16 by 2 (k = 3, nums = [8, 12, 8, 6]), divide 12 by 2 (k = 2, nums = [8, 6, 8, 6]), divide 8 by 2 (k = 1, nums = [4, 6, 8, 6]), divide 8 by 2 (k = 0, nums = [4, 6, 4, 6])\nResulting array: [4, 6, 4, 6]\nSum of the array: 4 + 6 + 4 + 6 = 20\n",
