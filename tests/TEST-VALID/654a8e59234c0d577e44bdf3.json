    "description": "One day you spot those *pesky* foxes digging a hole in your garden again! You run out to scare them away, and glimpse a wooden object partially uncovered in the hole. After digging around it, you pull up a small wooden chest. Opening the chest, you are intrigued to find a jaundiced parchment, upon which is inscribed a long prose in an indecipherable script. You download an app on your phone that transcribes the strange writing into a digital format, allowing you to make out the language: Latin. Unfortunately, your transcription is all in lowercase because you only have the free app version!\n\nYou decide to code a solution that will convert your text to sentence case and convert the word \"et\" to \"&\". You design the following convention.\n1. The first letter of the first word of every new sentence is majuscule.\n2. This selection of words always begins with a majuscule: *Andegavie, Anglia, Angliam, Anglie, Aquitanie, Bolonie, Dei, Deo, Henrici, Hibernie, Lancastrie, London, Londonie, Medeweiam, Michaelis, Michalis, Normannie, Notingeham, Pascha, Precipe, Tamisiam* and *Wallingefordie*.\n3. All other letters are minuscule.\n4. The word *et* is written as *&*.",
