    "description": "In this kata you will train your skills in:\n- static functions\n- read/write to/from file\n- using classes for storing files information\n\nThe idea:\nYou want to learn how to read information from file, write this information to file and how to use classes to help you.\n\nThe task:\nYour task is to complete class Person and class Worker and implement all missing functions.\n\nExplanations:\nYou have some .txt file (“people.txt”), where information about persons is stored. One person is stored in one line.\nWhere \"Oliver;m;23;\" means we have person with name \"Oliver\", he is a man ('m'), 23 years old.\nOr \"Isabella;w;27;\" means we have person with name \"Isabella\", she is a woman ('w'), 27 years old.\n\nClass Person stores information about person (or a line, that is stored per person in a \"people.txt\")\nClass Worker is used for reading (readItems()), saving (writeAllItems()) persons in some file or used for showing (showItems) persons from a vector with Persons.\nwriteSplitedItems() is used for saving persons separated by gender (see details in the initial solution).\nNote.\nTry to implement classes step by step, going test by test.\nHave fun and don't forget to select how you are satisfied with this kata and/or leave  your proposals or comments.
