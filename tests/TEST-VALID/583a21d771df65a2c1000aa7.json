    "description": "So creating \"the matrix\" was probably pretty complicated and required advanced fictional tech although at some point they probably just needed some code to turn strings into cool looking blocks of binary.\nPart of this challenge includes figuring out how to turn a string into binary. Hint: all characters have a unique numerical value.\n\nThe object of this kata is to take a given string and return it in binary format as a square or binary block of n x n (e.g. 4x4) by inserting new line characters ```\"\\n\"``` at every nth index\n```javascript\n\"0101\\n1101\\n1001\\n1001\" \n```\nSome of the string will be lost creating a block, but its all in the name of symmetry and coolness so its fine. The console should log your 'cool' binary block!^^ (you can pass without this but wont see the block)",
