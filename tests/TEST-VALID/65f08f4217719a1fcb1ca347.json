    "description": "#### Activation Functions: Sigmoid\nThe sigmoid activation function, often denoted as sigma(x), is a commonly used non-linear activation function in neural networks. \n\nIt squashes the input value to the range between 0 and 1, which makes it suitable for binary classification tasks or anywhere where a \"yes\" or \"no\" decision needs to be made.\n\n\n#### Formula:\nThe formula for the sigmoid activation function is:\n\n```math\n\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\n```\n\n#### Where:\n- `x` is the input to the function.\n- `e` is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to 2.71828.\n- `sigma(x)` is the output of the function.\n\n\n#### Your Job\nWrite a function that takes in a value x and computes its sigmoid activation.",
