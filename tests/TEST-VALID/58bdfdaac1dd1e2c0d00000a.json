    "description": "### The Problem\n\nDarren is a decorator. He often uses tiles to decorate floors. However, he never knows how many tiles to buy beforehand. He would like to know how many tiles he should order for a given floor space.\n\nThe tiles that Darren buys are all square, and come in two different sizes. Darren finds that the larger the tile, the easier it is to lay them. He has a strong preference for larger tiles. Also, Darren will never, **ever** cut a tile - not since the accident.\n\n### The Challenge\n\nWrite a function that calculates how many tiles of each size are required for a floor space of length `l` and width `w`.\n\n### The Details\n\nTile A has a side length of 21.     \nTile B has a side length of 9.\n\nThere is no minimum or maximum tile-tile distance.     \nAny tile pattern is acceptable, though note that all of the test cases can be solved without rotating the tiles.\n\nTo allow for breakages, the final value for each tile type must include an added 15% margin.\n\nThe function must return an object that has properties `a` and `b`. The number of whole tiles of type A and B must be assigned to the properties `a` and `b` respectively.\n\n`w` and `l` cannot be guaranteed to be positive, non-zero numbers. If either isn't, the function must return a value of false.\n\n### Example\n\nAn area of w = 21, and l = 30 can accommodate 1 A tile and 2 B tiles. Accounting for breakages, howManyTiles will return an object whose a = 2, and whose b = 3.",
