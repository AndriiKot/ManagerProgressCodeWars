You are asked to guess it, given several first terms in the sample tests. Then, you are asked to write a `generator` for the sequence. It will be tested up to its 100 000<sup>th</sup> term.\n~~~\n~~~if:haskell,\nThere is an ascending sequence of integers, the rule for generation of which is unknown.
