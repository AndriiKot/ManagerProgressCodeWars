    "description": "Imagine that you have earned some money.\nBut it turned out that you will need to pay tax on this amount.\n\nYou have reached an agreement with your employer. He agreed to pay you a little more money. So that after you pay the tax, you have the earned and previously agreed amount in your hands.\n\nWrite a function for the employer to help him calculate this amount. \nAs parameters, we will pass ```expected_income``` and ```tax```\n\n\n*Note:*\n\n1) The employer does not really want to mess around with small money and therefore the result of the function should always be an integer.\n\n2) Therefore, in some cases, you will receive a little more money than you expected. But this \"little\" will always be strictly less than 1\n\n3) Percentages are given as a float number. Those. 10 percent is 0.1 and 35 percent is 0.35\n\n4) And our humane financial system will not take taxes at 100 percent or more\n\n*Example:*\n\nI made $150. The tax is 10 percent (0.1).\nThe employer will need to send me the amount of $167.\nThen after paying the tax, I'll get $150 and 3 cents.\nVoila",
