    "description": "Extension of [this kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/514b92a657cdc65150000006/) by jhoffner. If you haven't completed this one, please consider doing said kata first.\n\nGiven a number `number` and a list of numbers `lst`, determine the sum of all multiples of any element of `lst` up to but not including `number`.\n\nFor example, if `lst = [3, 5]`, the problem is exactly like the problem this kata is based on.\n\nFor `number = 10`, `lst = [2, 3, 5]`, the numbers we want to sum are `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]`, and so the sum is 37.\n\nFor `number = 5`, `lst = [2]`, the numbers we want to sum are `[2, 4]`, and so the sum is 6.\n\nFor this kata, `2 <= number <= 10^7`, and `2 <= len(lst) <= 25`. Each `lst[i] < 1000`, but few test cases will test with very large `lst[i]`s.\n\nFor small and large tests, `lst` will only contain coprime numbers, but for large tests, `lst` will only contain primes `2 <= p <= 863`, or coprime square-free numbers `c < 863^2' \n\n",
