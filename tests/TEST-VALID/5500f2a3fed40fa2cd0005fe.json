    "description": "Given an address within an IPv4 CIDR prefix, return the first and last addresses within that range.\n\nRecommended prerequisites and background:\n\n* http://www.codewars.com/kata/ip-validation\n* http://www.codewars.com/kata/ip-address-to-number\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing\n\nCIDR notation is a way to designate a block of IP addresses by providing a _prefix length_.  The prefix is the set of bits that do not vary within that address block.\n\nFor instance, the CIDR block 192.168.1.0/24 has 24 fixed bits and 8 variable bits (32 bits total).  This means that the addresses range between 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.1.255 inclusive, or in binary:\n\n`11000000 10101000 00000001 00000000` through  \n`11000000 10101000 00000001 11111111`\n\nFor network configuration reasons, the first address in the block is referred to as the _network address_ and the last address is the _broadcast address_.\n\nThe input of your function will be a single address in CIDR notation.  It should return the array [_first address_, _last address_].\n\nExample: `ipRange('192.168.1.100/24')` should return `['192.168.1.0', '192.168.1.255']`\n\nYou can assume valid input for the purposes of this exercise.",
