    "description": "There are two rooms,\n\nIn the first one there is machine that turns the light off and on randomly\nand\nIn the second one a person turn the light off and on as he/she wishes.\n\nWe get the log files of the light condition in every second in an array\n\nexample:\nlog = [1,0,0,1,1,1,0] 1 represents on and 0 represents off.\n\nThe problem is someone messed up the log files and lost track of which log is belongs to which room but manage to keep them in pairs.\n\nYour duty is to write a function that takes two arrays (logs1 and logs2)  and find which log belongs to which room.\n\nFunction should return an array [1,2] or [2,1] depends on which logs belongs to which room.\n\nThe only thing you can be sure that one of the logs given is belongs to a person and others to machine. \n\n1 if the log is belongs to machine\n2 if the log is belongs to person",
