    "description": "A group of N golfers wants to play in groups of G players for D days in such a way that each golfer plays exactly once with all other golfers\n\n```\nSun\tABC\tDEF\tGHI\tJKL\tMNO\nMon\tADH\tBEK\tCIO\tFLN\tGJM\nTue\tAEM\tBHN\tCGK\tDIL\tFJO\nWed\tAFI\tBLO\tCHJ\tDKM\tEGN\nThu\tAGL\tBDJ\tCFM\tEHO\tIKN\nFri\tAJN\tBIM\tCEL\tDOG\tFHK\nSat\tAKO\tBFG\tCDN\tEIJ\tHLM\n ```\n \nWrite a function that validates a proposed solution, a list of list of strings, as being a solution to the social golfer problem. Each character represents a golfer, and each string is a group of players. Rows represent days. The solution above would be encoded as:\n\n\n```\n[\n  ['ABC', 'DEF', 'GHI', 'JKL', 'MNO'],\n  ['ADH', 'BEK', 'CIO', 'FLN', 'GJM'],\n  ['AEM', 'BHN', 'CGK', 'DIL', 'FJO'],\n  ['AFI', 'BLO', 'CHJ', 'DKM', 'EGN'],\n  ['AGL', 'BDJ', 'CFM', 'EHO', 'IKN'],\n  ['AJN', 'BIM', 'CEL', 'DOG', 'FHK'],\n  ['AKO', 'BFG', 'CDN', 'EIJ', 'HLM']\n]\n```\n\nYou need to make sure (1) that each golfer plays exactly once every day, (2) that the number and size of the groups is the same every day, and (3) that each player plays with every other player exactly once.\n\nIt is not necessary to consider the case where the number of golfers is zero\n\nAll credits to rtoal for creating this kata, with his permission I just edited to add additional constraint.
