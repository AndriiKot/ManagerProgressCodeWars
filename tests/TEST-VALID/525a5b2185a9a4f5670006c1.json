    "description": "The `new` operator in JavaScript creates objects by following these three steps:\n<ol><li>First, it creates a new empty object. (Already done for you here.)</li>\n<li>Next, it sets the new object’s `.__proto__` property to match the prototype property of the function being invoked.</li><li>Finally, the operator invokes the function and passes the new object as the “this” reference.</li></ol>\n\n<br />\nUse this understanding of the new operator to create an instance of the object MyObject, but do so without calling \"new MyObject()\".\n\n\nNote: Currently there is no way to prevent you from passing this kata just by typing \"var myObj = new MyObject();\". However, I will scrunch my eyebrows when I see your solution and make quiet remarks to myself about how you don't understand what this kata is trying to teach you.",
