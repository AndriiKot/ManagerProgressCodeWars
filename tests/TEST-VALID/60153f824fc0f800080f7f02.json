    "description": "An ape named Gimmy has a prime number in his mind. He challenges you to guess what it is. He will call your `guess_my_prime_number()` repeatedly until you guess it right. The repeated guesses should be returned using `yield`. If you guessed wrong, a clue will be sent to you using `send()`. The clue `too big` means your guess was too big; `too small` means it's too small. Here's the code that the Ape will use to send the clue to you:\n```\n# The Ape's code\ngen = guess_my_prime_number()\nguess = next(gen)\nwhile guess != secret_prime :\n    if not is_prime(guess):\n        guess = gen.send(\"prime!\")   # send no clue if the guess was not a prime number\n    elif guess < p:\n        guess = gen.send(\"too big\")  \n    else:\n        guess = gen.send(\"too small\")\n```\nIn response to the clue that you recieve using `yield`, you can change your guess accordingly using code like this:\n```\n# Your code\nclue = yield my_guess\nif clue == \"too small\" :\n    my_guess += 1   # If the previous guess was too small, now I need to guess a larger number\nelif clue == \"too big\":\n    my_guess -= 1\nelif clue == \"prime!\":\n    do_something  # The previous guess was not a prime number and the ape didn't offer a clue.\n```\n\nApe Gimmy knows only prime numbers. If your guess is not a prime number, he will have no clue and send you `prime!`.\n\nApe Gimmy blinks from time to time. Whenever he blinks, he comes up with a different prime number in his mind. When that happens, he will send you a clue \"blink!\". \n\nIf you guessed it right, a new round will start, again with a fresh call to your `guess_my_prime_number()`. \n\nApe Gimmy has a big brain and prime numbers in his mind can be almost as large as 2<sup>100</sup>.\n\n",
