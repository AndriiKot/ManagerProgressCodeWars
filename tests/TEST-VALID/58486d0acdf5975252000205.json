    "description": "Many people type their last names wrong.  When it happens that data needs to be cleaned.  It turns out \"Johnson\" is often mispelled.  Some examples include missing letters, duplicate letters or incorrect capitalization.\n\nAfter some team discussion it was decided to correct the most common mispelling of Johnson. The corrections were confirmed with the users before hand.\n\nThe task is to return true if the name is most likely a mis-typed version of \"Johnson\".  \n\nThese are all variations of Johnsons that should be changed to Johnson:\n\njohnson, JOhson, Johnso, Johaons, JOshonson, Johnnson\n\nAnything else should be left as is.\n\nWrite a function that returns true if the name should be changed to Johnson.  Return false if the name should not be changed. ",
