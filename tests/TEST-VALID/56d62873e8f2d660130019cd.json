    "description": "As nice as javascript is, it is famous for having somewhat unpredictable behaviour every once in a while.\n\nOne good example is with the modulo (%) operator. While it works for any purposes I can think of right now when operating on two positive whole numbers or zero(es), add a negative number to the the mix and disaster soon unfolds, with results varying from plain wrong to bizarre (\"-1 % 1\" for example returns \"-0\").\n\nYour mission this time is to code a function, ```mod() ```, which takes two parameters, ```a``` and ```b```, and returns ```a % b``` correctly (same way as it would in Python, which is also how the consensus in Number Theory defines the modulo operation). It should also return ```undefined``` in the event of an impossible division.\n\nA few interesting links:\n\nhttp://math.stackexchange.com/questions/519845/modulo-of-a-negative-number ```(related discussion)```\n\nhttp://www.miniwebtool.com/modulo-calculator/?number1=19&number2=-17 ```(useful to test edge cases)```",
