    "description": "**Calculator for expressions with fractions**\n\nProgram a function that evaluates a  mathematical expression in a String which contains fractions:\n\n```( 1|2 + 1 ) * 1|6 / 3 + 5|16 ```\n\n*Expressions*      \nThe expression is composed of the four operations +, -, \\*, /,  (nested)\nparantheses and numbers.\nAll numbers in the expression are either a natural number or a a fraction.\nA fraction has a numerator and a denominator, both natural numbers. One or both of them can be negative.   \nAs doubles and floats are not needed for this Kata they are disabled.\n\n*Format of input and output*   \nFractions are notated with a '|' to separate numerator and denominator, so three quarters would be denoted as   \n```3|4 ```   \nSpaces can occur between numbers and operators but not within fractions or between numbers and their sign.\n\nThe return value is a string representation of the with the '|' as separator where\nthe fraction has to be reduced ( ```21|14 ``` is wrong ```3|2 ``` is correct).\nIf the fraction is negative, the sign **must** precede the numerator (```-3|2 ``` is correct, ```3|-2 ``` is wrong. Yes, negative denominator is valid *input* but\ninvalid *output*). If the resulting fraction corresponds to a natural number, just return the number. Have a look at the test cases for clarification if needed.\n\nIf there is the attempt to divide by zero (either by giving a zero-denominator or by dividing by a zero-valued number) an ArithmeticException has to be thrown.\n\nApart from that the tests will only be valid expressions. \n\nIf you solved the Kata <a href='https://www.codewars.com/kata/precise-fractions-pt-1-basics'>Precise fractions pt. 1 - basics</a> already your class *Fraction*  will come in handy. Just remove the toDecimal-Method as the Test Cases rejects Solutions with floats or\ndoubles\n",
