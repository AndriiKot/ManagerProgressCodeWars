Furthermore, this seems to occur under mutual exclusion via the monitor of the very same `boolean[]` instance, so the bomb will always be armed if run normally. Fortunately, you think you might be able to prevent it from running normally -- after all, you and your squad's lives depend on it.\n\nYou use your trusty bytecode injector to inject your `void defuse()` method, and the game begins...",
