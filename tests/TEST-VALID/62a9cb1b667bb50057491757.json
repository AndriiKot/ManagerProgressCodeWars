    "description": "It's common that house numbers alternate between the 2 sides of a street. \nLooking at one side you'd expect to see numbers such as 4,6,8,10... or 9,7,5, but never -1,1,3, nor 0,2,4 or 1,2,3.\n\nYou receive an array of integers, and should return the length of the sequence if the number sequence in the array represents a valid house number **sequence**, or -1 in any other case.\n\nFor example, [2,4,6] should return 3 but [3] or [2,4,2] should return -1\n\nWhat is required for a valid sequence is either a monotoneous rising or a monotoneous declining sequence, with a minimum lenght of 2, and a constant difference of 2 (or -2 for declining). Only positive numbers allowed.\n\n",
