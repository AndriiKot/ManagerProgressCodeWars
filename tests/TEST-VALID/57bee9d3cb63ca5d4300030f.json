    "description": "Twenty One is a game I always used to play in my childhood. It involved two players, in this case the computer versus the player. Each would say a maximum of 4 numbers, but a minimum of 1, in numerical order. Only whole numbers were allowed- no decimals. Starting at 1, the first person to say the number 21 lost.\n\nAn example game would be:\n```\n  Player- 1, 2, 3\n  Computer- 4, 5\n  Player- 6, 7, 8, 9\n  Computer- 10\n  Player- 11\n  Computer- 12, 13, 14, 15\n  Player- 16, 17\n  Computer- 18, 19, 20\n  Player- 21 (Loss)\n```\nAs long as the Player starts, and the computer keeps counting to a multiple of 5, the computer always wins. Design a program to win against this 'player' (AI).\n\nInput will be the number the player stopped on, for example '1', and the output will be the computer's overall move, with commas and spaces separating the results- for example '2, 3, 4, 5'\n \nIn an event where the input is not an integer, or is a multiple of 5 (no way of guaranteeing an win), or is above 20 (no computer turn needed), or is below 0, return \"Invalid\"",
