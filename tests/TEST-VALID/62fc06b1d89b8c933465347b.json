    "description": "# Write a program that calculates the grade level for a piece of text #\n\nThe program will use the Coleman Liau index formula, the output of this index will\nbe the grade level\n0.0588 * x - 0.296 * y - 15.8 ROUNDED TO NEAREST 1\nwhere x is the average letters/100 words and y is the average sentances/100 words\n\nEx.\n```\nInput: As the average number of letters and words per sentence increases, the Coleman-Liau index gives the text a higher reading level. If you were to take this paragraph, for instance, which has longer words and sentences than either of the prior two examples, the formula would give the text an twelfth-grade reading level.\n\nOutput: 12\n\nInput: Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework, but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of the night. And he also happened to be a wizard.\n\nOutput: 5\n```\n\nAll characters will be from a-z or A-Z all words will have a space between them and all sentances will end with a '!' '.' or '?' \nKeep in mind that the last word of the text doesn't contain a space!\nWatch out for commas, they should be ignored\n\nIf the text grade level is over 16 just return 16\n\nif the text grade level is under 1 just return 0\n\n\n\n--- Kata inspired by Cs50 ---\n\n\n\n",
