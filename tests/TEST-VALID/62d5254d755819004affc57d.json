    "description": "# I bring to your attention a kata called ZY\\sEncode.\n\nHere was supposed to be a motivating story about spies and bandits, but for another time.\n\nSo, to the point.\n\nBefore you, in fact, the cipher.\nEncryption example:\n\n```javascript\n'hello world!' => 'c0gzb gozdd azdkl zekpy fm1zd s4zes gzdkl zc0gz 1i4'\n```\n\nIn order not to turn an interesting kata into a boring torture, here are some research tips for you:\n- you don't need to go deep into bits\n- you don't need any \"key\" to decrypt\n- the encryption method used is... lol jk im not telling you\n- think of a Unicode table\n- carefully selected test cases\n- read the title again\n\nI think that's enough for a start.\n\n## NOTE\nIf you're stuck, here are some more tips. Open them one by one and keep trying!\nSo that you don’t read them by accident, I encrypted them using the incredibly complex ROT13 algorithm, about which you can’t find information anywhere on the Internet and, moreover, an online decryption service.\n\nEven `rot13.com` will not help\n\nSo the list is:\n- frevbhfyl, guvax nobhg gur Havpbqr gnoyr.
