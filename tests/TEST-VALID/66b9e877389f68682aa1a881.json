    "description": "\n<h1>Description</h1>\n\n\nFarmer John needs to build a new fence. He has marked the starting and ending points of the fence line. To ensure the fence\nis sturdy, he wants to place ```n``` posts equal intervals along the line between the startpost ```start``` and the endpost ```end```. John needs a program to calculate the exact positions where he should dig the holes for the posts. Can you help him by writing a function that takes the start and end points of the line and the number of posts and returns their positions?\n\n\n<h1>Task</h1>\n\n\nYou are given two tuples (x,y) as the positions of the first and the last posts, and the number of posts which should be placed between them. Return a list of tuples (x,y) for all posts including start and endpost. Round the coordinates to two decimalplaces. For a negative number of posts or startpost and endpost at the same position return \"Fence could not be build!\"\n\n\n<h1>Examples</h1>\n\n\n(0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 10.0), 4     -->   [(0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 2.0), (0.0, 4.0), (0.0, 6.0), (0.0, 8.0), (0.0, 10.0)]\n\n(0.0, 0.0), (15.0, 15.0), 2    -->   [(0.0, 0.0), (5.0, 5.0), (10.0, 10.0), (15.0, 15.0)] \n\n\n<h1>Hints</h1>\n\nCoordinates can be negative!\n",
