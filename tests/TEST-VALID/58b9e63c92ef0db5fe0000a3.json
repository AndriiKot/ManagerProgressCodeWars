    "description": "#Count Prime\n\nSid wants to generate Prime Number for his cryptosystem. As Prime Numbers are bare-bones of any cryptosystem, Sid is baffled with his approach in finding the prime numbers and counting the prime numbers between two given integers.\n\nAs you are a good programmer, he wants your help in counting the number of Prime Numbers between any two given integers x and y (inclusive of both).\n\n\n**INPUT**\n\n>Two integers x and y (both integers) as  Input.\n\n**OUTPUT**\n\n>A String containing the number of prime numbers between x and y (inclusive of both).\n\n**CONSTRAINTS**\n\n>-1000 < x, y < 1000\n\n\n- Convert the negative numbers to positive.\n- If x or y are not between the specified range, return `\"Numbers should be   less than 1000.\"\n- x might be greater than y, deal with that as well",
