    "description": "Imagine you are working on a farm. Each of your crops has a value. One morning a small snake enters your field and starts eating your crops. Calculate the total value of the crops eaten by the snake.\n\n* The size of the snake will be constant and one.\n\n* The value of each crop will be random integer between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9).\n\n* Crops eaten will not grow again and their value remain as 0.\n\n* Your function should take 3 parameters: _map, start_position, move_orders. (All of them will be random.)\n\n* start_position is the first position of the snake. (It can be middle of your farm).\n\n* The snake will move according to the move_orders.\n  - The length of the move_orders will be equal to _map's height * _map's width.\n  - '>': Snake will move to East.\n  - '<': Snake will move to West.\n  - '^': Snake will move to North.\n  - 'v': Snake will move to South.\n  \n* Your task is to return the total value of your crops eaten.\n\n* Note that the start_position will be (row, column).\n\n* Assume that the field is wrapped.\n\nDetailed Example:\n```\n_map = [[2, 4, 5],\n        [6, 2, 7]]     \nstart_position = (1, 2)\nmove_orders = \">^<vv>\"\n```\n- Solution of total_value_of_crops_eaten(_map, start_position, move_orders):\n- According to the start_position, Snake will eat the crop which has a value of 7.\n- After that, the snake will move according to the move_orders.\n````\n[[2, 4, 5], starting_position is (1, 2), \n [6, 2, 0]]  total_value = 7\n````\n````\n[[2, 4, 5], current move is \">\", \n [>, 2, 0]]  total_value = 13\n````\n````\n[[^, 4, 5], current move is \"^\", \n [0, 2, 0]]  total_value = 15\n````\n````\n[[0, 4, <], current move is \"<\", \n [0, 2, 0]]  total_value = 20\n````\n````\n[[0, 4, 0], current move is \"v\", \n [0, 2, v]]  total_value = 20\n````\n````\n[[0, 4, v], current move is \"v\", \n [0, 2, 0]]  total_value = 20\n````\n````\n[[>, 4, 0], current move is \">\", \n [0, 2, 0]]  total_value = 20\n````\nSo the solution is 20.",
