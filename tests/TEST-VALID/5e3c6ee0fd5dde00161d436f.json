    "description": "Elon Musk wants to drill a set of tunnels to a number of important locations.  Unfortunately, there are multiple ways he could connect all of these tunnels.  Can you help him find the cheapest way to connect all of the locations?\n\nLocations will be given as a list. `['A','B','C', ...]`\n\nTunnels will be given as a dictionary.  Each vertice will be a key, and the values will be a list of all of the points that are connected to that vertice.  So, if 'A' and 'B' are connected then the tunnel will be listed under both vertice 'A' and vertice 'B'.  The cost of the tunnel will be the second value.\ni.e. `{'A':[('B',10),('C',5)], 'B':[('A',10)], 'C':[('A',5)]}`\n\nYour job is to return the minimum cost to connect all of the locations.\n\nRead More: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm\n\nNote: All graphs will be connected.",
