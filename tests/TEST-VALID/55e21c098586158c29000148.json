    "description": "#Postfix Calculator\n---\nPostfix notation gives us the ability to perform calculations without parentheses. When using postfix notation the operands come before the operators. The order of operations for postfix notation is always left to right. \n\n\nSo in order to convert the infix expression of 1 + 2 to postfix notation the expression would be written as 1 2 +.\n\n#Goal\n---\n\nThe goal of this kata is for you to write a postfix calculator that can handle the +,-,\\*, and / operators.\n\nOnly valid input will be tested so no need to worry about invalid expressions. \n\nEach expression will be similar to the following form: 42 6 / 5 +\nPlease take note of the spaces!\n\n*hint - if you are having trouble solving this kata think of a data structure that utilizes LIFO",
