    "description": "# Rethinking the n queens problem for SQL\n\nThis is a version of the classic n queens problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) but reimagined for SQL!\n\n\nImagine an NxN chessboard. You also have N queens. How many possible ways can you place all of the queens on the chessboard such that none of them are threatening eachother?\n\nFor example, with a 4x4 board and 4 queens, we can do the following placements:\n\n```\n- q - -\n- - - q\nq - - -\n- - q -\n```\n\nand \n\n```\n- - q -\nq - - -\n- - - q\n- q - -\n```\n\nAny other arrangement will lead to us not being able to place all 4 queens without at least one queen being threatened. Therefore, there are 2 solutions.\n\n\nYou should create a function `nqueens(n int)` which, given an integer `n`, returns the number of possible solutions on an n by n board with n queens. For example,\n\n`nqueens(4)`\n\nshould return 2.",
