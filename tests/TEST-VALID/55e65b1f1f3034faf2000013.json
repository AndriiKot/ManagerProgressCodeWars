    "description": "# xml to object - xml #1\nYou have been given a task assigned by your friend to parse some XML formatted strings into javascript objects.\n\n## task\nYour task is to interpret an xml formatted string into a javascript object. You will be given a string as an argument and must return an array of obejects. All objects will be formatted correctly.\n\n## preloaded\nYou have been preloaded with a helper, this can be used to display the xml string correctly. To use this helper call ```console.xml({xml string})```\n\n## examples\n```\ninput: xmlToObject('<basic></basic>')\noutput: [{basic:{attributes:{},sub:[]}}]\n```\nThis is an example of the most basic input and output. The input has a star and end tag called basic, you must then return an array with an object with the property of the tag name which is an object that contains ```attributes``` which must always be present, then the second property is called ```sub``` this is an array which contains other objects of any other xml data which may be contained inside the basic tags.",
