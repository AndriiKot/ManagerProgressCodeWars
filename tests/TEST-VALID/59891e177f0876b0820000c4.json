    "description": "Jo-jo is a lonely man with a clever and eternally living cat. However, the cat feels Jo-jo is too lonely, and it decides to leave him; but it also hates to leave him forever. \n\nThen the cat decides to revisit Jo-jo according to the following fixed scheme. \n\n* It leaves on the _t_-th day of the week (1 to 7 inclusive). \n* Its first revisit with Jo-jo is _p_ days later. \n* The time span between revisits are in a geometric sequence. \n\nFor example  \n\n1. First revisit: _p_ days after its leaving. \n1. Second revisit: _p q_ days after the first revisit. \n1. Third revisit: _p q^2_ days after the second revisit, and so on. \n    \n    \nPlease calculate on which day of the week (still 1 to 7, inclusive) the cat\nrevisits Jo-jo for the _n_-th time. \n\nThe numbers _p_, _q_, _t_, _n_ are all positive integers. \nAs usual, _t_ is given as integer, \nbut **_p_, _q_, and _n_ are given in a string represented in decimal ways. The length of such strings are all divisible by 3, padded with\nleading zeros. ** (This format might be a hint, but also might be a misleading to the solution. )\n\nRestrictions: _t_ must be in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]; the length of any string _p_, _q_, or _n_ is guaranteed not to exceed 10002. \nSince the strings are too long, _large random tests do not reveal their values in test messages. _\n\nWell, corner cases will also be tested, but all numbers are guaranteed to\nbe positive integers, and the strings are always in the described format. \n\nWarning\n=======\n\nNEVER even try to calculate the exact numbers involved. \nThe numbers are far too huge. \n\nYou have to find out the patterns to solve the problem. \n\nClarification\n=============\n\nThe time span is counted as difference of moments. For example, between\ntoday (the eighth of August) and tomorrow (the ninth) there is 1 day. \n\nExample Test\n============\n\n_p_ = '001', _q_ = '002', _t_ = 2, _n_ = '004'\n\n1. Today the cat leaves. It is Tuesday (well, for example; you can read it anyway you want, and it will not change your result). \n1. One day later, it will be the cat's first revisit -- Wednesday. \n1. Two days later, the second revisit -- Friday. \n1. _Four_ days later, the third revisit -- Tuesday. \n1. Eight days later, the fourth revisit -- Wednesday. \n\nSo please return 3 as integer. \n",
