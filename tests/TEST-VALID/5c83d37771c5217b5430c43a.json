    "description": "This kata - Petals Around the Rose - is a dice game.\nImagine that you wake up in a room with no doors or windows. You can see one person in the room with a small box in his hand. He tells you that the only way out was to make a computer program for finding the solution of a specific dice game. \n\nThere are no utilitarian things in the room and the person is too strong to be overpowered. So you agree with him. The person opens a box and takes out 5 die. \nAfter each roll, the person arranges the die in a row before telling the answer.\n\nThe objective of this kata is simply to make a function ```petalsAroundTheRoseInTheRow(outcomes)``` where ```outcomes``` is an array of the numbers which come on the die. However, this is not so straight forward as it seems in the start, as it is for you to find out the algorithm (for the logic of the program). The conversation between you and the person is as follows:\n\n                                 ********Conversation**********\n\n```Outcome 1: [4,1,6,3,6]```\n\nYou: \"What is the answer?\"\n\nPerson: \"6\"\n\nYou: \"Would it still be two if I moved the dice without turning any of them over, just rearranging the pattern?\"\n\nPerson: \"All answers in this game - Petals Around the Rose - are even. I am supposed to tell you this much only. Of course I would also tell the answers to the rolls.\"\n\nYou: \"Ok. Roll it again.\"\n\n```Outcome 2: [5,6,5,4,4]```\n\nYou: \"I've no idea! What's the answer?\"\n\nPerson: \"8\"\n\nYou: \"Alright! Roll some more times and tell the answers.\"\n\nPerson: \"As you wish.\"\n\n```Outcome 3: [3,5,5,5,6]```\n\nPerson: \"Answer is 24.\"\n\n```Outcome 4: [2,6,2,1,4]```\n\nPerson: \"Answer is 0.\"\n\n```Outcome 5: [4,3,2,1,3]```\n\nPerson: \"Answer is 10.\"\n\nYou: \"I think I got it.\"\n\nThe person gives you a laptop with codewars interface on it and you start coding to create the function ```petalsAroundTheRoseInTheRow``` ......",
