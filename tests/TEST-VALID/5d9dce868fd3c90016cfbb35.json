    "description": "In statistic is known the term mode. The mode of a set of data values is the value that appears most often. For example suppose the set of data values are {1,2,2,3}. There are three number inside the data set: 1, 2, and 3. Number 1 appears once, 2 appears twice, and 3 appears once. That mean number 2 appears most often so the mode is 2.\n\nSometime we can find that the most often more than one number here the example\n```\nData set    = {2,2,2,3,3,3,4,5,6}\nMode result = {2,3}\n```\nIn this Kata, your task is to make a function called ```int modeCount(int[] data)``` that the parameter is an array of integer and the result is integer. The parameter is a set of data values that you will find the mode. The output is how many kind of mode. Here the example:\n```\nData set    = {2,2,2,3,3,3,4,5,6}\nMode result = {2,3}\nmode Count  = 2\n\nData set    = {1,2,2,3}\nMode result = {2}\nMode Count  = 1\n\nData set    = {2,2,2,3,3,3,4,5,6,6,6}\nMode result = {2,3,6}\nMode Count  = 3\n```",
