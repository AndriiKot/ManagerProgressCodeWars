    "description": "You will make function that is used to find the longest same letter on the board 2D. I will explain by an example below.\n\nHere the board 5 x 5 characters that contains random letters.\n```\n M  I  P  L  L \n M  Z  T  L  W \n M  J  X  B  M \n F  M  M  N  T \n P  I  F  R  Y \n```\nYou have to find the how long the longest character in the board that has the same letter. On that board the longest character with the same letter is letter M. Letter M composes a line vertically and continuesly as long as three character and there is no other character longer than M in that direction.\n\nMore clearly I will clear the other letters except the M that are in the longest segment. It will be shown below.\n```\n M  .  .  .  . \n M  .  .  .  . \n M  .  .  .  . \n .  .  .  .  . \n .  .  .  .  . \n```\n\nYour function will return 3.\n\nYou must know that the continuesly and straight letter could be vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.\n\nIt doesn't matter when there are more than one letter have the same length. You just give the length as the result, not the letter. Here the other example below. There are two letter have the same length. Those are Q and P, both are two. No matter Q nor P you find, you just return 2 and it is correct.\n\n```\n F  P  S  D  A \n Y [Q] J [P] U \n I [Q] C [P] Y \n A  F  E  X  Z \n O  E  H  F  X \n ```\n ",
