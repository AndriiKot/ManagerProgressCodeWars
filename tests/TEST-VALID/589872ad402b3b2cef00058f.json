    "description": "Hello fellow coders!\n\nIf you're familiar with maths you may know of Geometric Sequences. A Geometric Sequence is a sequence that has a common ratio where the previous term is multiplied by the common ratio to make the next term in the sequence. You can calculate the sum of the sequence by using the following formula:\n\n<img src=\"http://mathematicsi.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/sum-formula.png\" alt=\"Image result for sum of geometric sequence formula\"/>\n\nThe parts of the formula that need to be known are:\n\nr = Any one term of the sequence dividied by the previous term.\n\na = The first term of the sequence\n\nn = The number of terms in the sequence\n\nThis formula only works if r > 1. If r < 1, \"r^n - 1\" and \"r-1\" should be switched to \"1-r^n\" and \"1-r\" so that the formula equals: a(1-r^n)/(1-r)\n\nIf r equals 1, the program must return 0.\n\nAll answers should be rounded to 5 decimal places.\n\nYou will be given the sequence in the list, but the last term in the list is n, the number of terms in the sequence. This will be enough data to calculate the sum of the sequence.\n\nAs an example, if you are given:\n```python\n[1, 2, 4, 5]\n```\nThe program should return\n```python\n31\n```\nbecause if you plug the numbers into the formula, where 5 is the number of terms in the sequence, the answer is 31.\n\nHope you enjoy, please report any issues with the kata!",
