    "description": "Through the use of generics, modern programming languages allow you to code a solution to a problem that works for several different types.\n\nIn this exercise, you are tasked with writing a function that takes three values represented by some type, and returns their sum, as that same type. The prototype function is written to use integers, so change that function declaration and fill out the code to work with the following data types:\n\n* `Int`\n* `UInt`\n* `Float`\n* `Double`\n\nDepending on the language you use, it may be possible to pass these test cases using another language feature, such as operator overloading. Try to solve this using generics, or at least be aware of how your code is passing the tests.",
