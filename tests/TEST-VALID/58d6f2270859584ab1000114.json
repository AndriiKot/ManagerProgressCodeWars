    "description": "# Scale\n\nMajor chords are one of the building blocks of our contemporary music, so let's build some! They are comprised of a root note, a major third, and a perfect fifth from that root note. Let's unpack that.\n\nWe have 7 notes to build from (A, B, C, D, E, F, G). The distance between each of these notes is of 2 semitones, except for two intervals. The intervals that go from B to C and from E to F are of only 1 semitone.\n\nEach of those notes can be made \"sharp\" (written as #), which will make them 1 semitone higher in pitch; or \"flat\" (written as b), which will lower them 1 semitone. And so, the interval from C to D would be of 2 semitones, but of only 1 semitone from C# to D, and of three semitones from Cb to D:\n\n```\nC to D = 2 semitones\nC# to D = 1 semitone\nCb to D = 3 semitones\nC# to D# = 2 semitones\nC# to Db = Equivalent\n```\n\nKeep in mind the intervals from B to C and from E to F are originally of only 1 semitone, therefore:\n\n```\nE to F = 1 semitone\nE# to F = Equivalent\nE to Fb = Equivalent\n```\n\n# Major Chords\n\nAs an example, to build the major chord for E (E major) we would need to find its major third and its perfect fifth.\n\n- For a major third, we would **count two notes forward** in the scale (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) from the root (in this case, E), arriving at G. A major third needs to have **4 semitones**, but the interval from E to G only has 3. We'd therefore need to make our G sharp (G#) to get an extra semitone, for a total of 4.\n- For a perfect fifth, we would **count four notes forward**. As our reference scale ends at G, we would continue with A again after that (the distance from G to A also being of 2 semitones), arriving at B. A perfect fifth has **7 semitones**, which is exactly how many we get from E to B.\n\nThe chord of E major would therefore be comprised of E, G#, and B.\n\n# Task\n\nYou will be given a root note as a string, either by itself (natural), sharp, or flat (examples: \"G\", \"Gb\", \"G#\"). Your task is to write a function that programatically returns a list containing the three notes that would make the major chord for that root.\n\n```javascript\nmajorChord('Db') = ['Db', 'F', 'Ab' ]\n```\n\n# Rules\n\n- Any input string other than the notes (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) by themselves, or with a sharp (#) or flat (b) symbol should be considered invalid and return an empty list.\n- Due to their special nature, and for simplicity, E#, Fb, B#, and Cb should always be treated as their natural equivalents. E# will be taken as F, Fb as E, B# as C, and Cb as B.\n\n```javascript\nmajorChord('Fb') = [ 'E', 'G#', 'B' ]\nmajorChord('C#') = [ 'C#', 'F', 'G#' ]\n```\n\n- If we need to add more than 1 semitone up or down to our third or fifth to reach the 4 or 7 semitones needed, we'll jump one whole note forward or backwards. For example, when obstaining the third of D# we'd arrive at F. However, there are only 2 semitones between D# and F. Instead of adding two sharps to F, we'd jump to G, for a total of 4 semitones.\n\n```javascript\nmajorChord('D#') = [ 'D#', 'G', 'A#' ]\n```",
