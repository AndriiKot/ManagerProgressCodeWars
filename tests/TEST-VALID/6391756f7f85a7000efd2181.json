    "description": "I am a huge fan of the FIFA world cup. However, I am currently in the EST timezone which means I miss most of the games because I am at work. I usually keep live track of the scores though. One of my favorite things to do upon seeing the final score is to play out the goal-scoring orders that may have led to that outcome. I tried counting them one time and my brain froze. That's what code is for, amirite?\n\n## Task\nGiven the final score of a football (soccer if that's what rocks your boat) match, provide the count of all the possible orderings of the goals that were scored.\n\nThe function you write will take in a string that represents the final game score as an argument. It is expected to always return a number.\n\n## Example\n\n> Final score: 3-1\n\n> Count: 4\n\n> Explanation: The possible orderings include:\n  1) _team A scored 3 goals, then team B scored 1 goal_\n  2) _team A scored 2 goals, then team B get one back, then team A score final goal, crushing their opponents' hopes_\n  3) _team A scored 1 goal, then team B equalized, then team A scored two more goals_\n  4) _team B scored the first goal but team A pulled an upset comeback by scoring three goals_\n\n## Notes\n1. There will be an unrealistic number of goals being scored, so count efficiently.\n2. We are not accounting for either of the two halves of the game i.e. no need to try and count whether a goal is scored in the first half or the second half. That will probably be for a later kata.",
