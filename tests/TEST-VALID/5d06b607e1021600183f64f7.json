Below is the method to generate such numbers.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Generation of ludic numbers:</h2>\n\n```\nFirst take the natural numbers starting from 2.\n[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 ...]\n1 is the first ludic number -> Ludic = {1}.\nNote that you should not remove every 1th-indexed number, despite 1 being ludic.\n\nTake the first element from the resulting array: 2.\nRemove every 2nd indexed number.\n[3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 ...]\nThe first deleted number is 2 -> Ludic = {1, 2}.\n\nTake the first element from the resulting array: 3.\nRemove every 3rd indexed number.\n[5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 ...]\nThe first deleted number is 3 -> Ludic = {1, 2, 3}.\n\nTake the first element from the resulting array: 5.\nRemove every 5th number.\n[7, 11, 13, 19 ...]\nThe first deleted number is 5 -> Ludic = {1, 2, 3, 5}.\n\netc...\n```\n\n<p>\nWrite a function to return an integer: the sum of the first n ludic numbers.<br>\nYou can assume that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10000.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Sample Tests:</h2>\n\n```\nsumLudic(1) -> 1\nsumLudic(10) -> 107\nsumLudic(25) -> 1100\n```",
