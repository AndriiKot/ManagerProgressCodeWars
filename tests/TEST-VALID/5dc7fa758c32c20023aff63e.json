    "description": "Look at your credit card and check the 16-digit card number. Write the number in alternating fashion. For example, if your card number is 3141592653589793, then your numbers would be 34525599 and 11963873.\n\n1. Add up the digits of the top number, then double it. Write that number down.\n\n2. Add up the digits of the bottom number. Write that number down.\n\n3. How many of the digits of the top number are 5 or greater? Write that down.\n\n4. Now add the three numbers you wrote down, and look at the last digit of your answer.\n\n5. Is the last digit 0?\n\nThere’s no magic here. This is the Luhn system used for credit and A.T.M. cards. The steps you just took are what happens automatically when you use your card. A wrong digit or transposing nearly any two consecutive digits in your 16-digit card number can be detected, without using a database, because the final digit of the total won’t add up to 0. See for yourself. Do the math and your last digit will be 0. Change any number on your card and it won’t.\n\n",
