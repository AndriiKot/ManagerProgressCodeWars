    "description": "In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.\n\nYour task is to write a function that takes exactly 2 arguments (_string, shiftkey_) and encrypts the given string. Any other character than isn't a letter should stay unchanged.\n\n__Assumption__: shiftkey is integer from [-25, 25] interval.\n\nFor example:<br>\n- caesar(\"Abcd\", 2) should return \"Cdef\"<br>\n- caesar(\"message\", -1) should return \"ldrrzfd\"<br>\n- caesar(\"ZZ Top\", 3) should return \"CC Wrs\"<br>\nand so on ...<br>",
