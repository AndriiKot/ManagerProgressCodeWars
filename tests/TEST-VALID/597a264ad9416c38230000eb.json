    "description": "ABC Inspection company has a new pricing table.\n\nThe standard man day cost is ```$315/day```, but there will be a discount for customer ordered for more manday\n\nThe discount calcuated based on 2 parameter - ```manday``` and ```sample size```\n\nHere are the rules to calcuate the discount :\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>More than(or equal to) ```10 days``` and ```50 sample size```, there will be a ```50% off``` per man day</li>\n  <li>More than(or equal to) ```5 days``` and ```25 sample size```, there will be a ```30% off``` per man day</li>\n\t<li>More than(or equal to) ```2 days``` and ```15 sample size```, there will be a ```15% off``` per man day</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>If the number of manday are not falling into above criteria, there will no discount applied.</p>\n\nThe discounted manday ```must be in an integer```, if the result are in float, a ```ceiling rule will be aplpied``` (e.g. If the discounted man day cost = ```170.5```, the final charge will be ```171``` )\n\nAlso there is a minimum sameple size vary by manday :\n<ol>\n  <li>More(or equals to ) ```10 man day```, minimum sample size is ```50```</li>\n  <li>More(or equals to ) ```5  man day```, minimum sample size is ```25```</li>\n  <li>More(or equals to ) ```2  man day```, minimum sample size is ```15```</li>\n</ol>\n\nYour task is write a function to calcuate the final cost of manday. And ```don't forget to add a'$' sign in the final result```\n\n\n\n",
