    "description": "Letters are at either an even or odd position in the alphabet (in this case A is considered to be at position 1).\n\nFor this kata you're supplied with two arrays - one containing words, one containing numbers. Your task is to compare each word to each number to see if they contain a matching even-odd pattern. A valid match would be where either the word contains the even-odd pattern of the number, or vice versa.\n\nTo get the final answer, sum the indeces of all matching pairs.\n\nThe supplied arrays might not be the same length, and the words and numbers themselves will vary in length also.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```javascript\nwords = ['one', 'four', 'nine']\nnumbers = [185, 519, 878]\n```\n\n'one' (O-E-O) matches with 185 (O-E-O), and their indices are [0] and [0]\n\n'four' (E-O-O-E) doesn't match any of the numbers\n\n'nine' (E-O-E-O) matches with 185 (O-E-O), and their indices are [2] and [0]\n\n'nine' also matches with 878 (E-O-E), and their indices are [2] and [2]\n\n\nThe sum of all the matching indices in this case would be 6 (0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 2).",
