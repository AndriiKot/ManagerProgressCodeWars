    "description": "Someone makes a bet with you: if you can guess how much money's in their wallet, they'll hand it over. You get ten guesses.\n\nYou're given a range of possible values. The range is updated after every incorrect guess--depending on whether yours was too low or too high. The value will always be a positive integer within (and including) the minimum and maximum values.\n\nYou're no sucker, so you know guessing blindly won't get you anywhere. You decide to come up with a system for guessing efficiently. Write the guess(min_value, max_value) function and have it return your next guess.",
