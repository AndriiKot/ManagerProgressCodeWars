    "description": "The law of large numbers states that as the sample grows in size the percentage of numbers falling within the standard deviation of the sample nears 68.2%, ultimately showing your sample as a representation of the normal distribution. Calculate the standard deviation of a given array of numbers and then determine how many of the numbers in the sample fall within the standard deviation and display this as a percentage (rounded to two decimal places) of the sample.\n\nAssume the given array will always have at least one item in it and the array items will always be an integer of positive or negative value.\n\n",
