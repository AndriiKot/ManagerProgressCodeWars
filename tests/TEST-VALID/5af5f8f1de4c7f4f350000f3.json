    "description": "Many Games use dice to determine outcome of a move.\n\nAll or nothing! Roll the dice! Lucky sevens! A casino can be vibrant with the noise of slot machines, dealers, and gamblers using the language of luck. Many games, such as craps, use dice rolls to determine the winners and losers. But have you ever wondered what the singular form of dice is?\n\nFirst, what exactly are dice? Most dice are small cubes; on each of their six sides, they have dots that correspond to the numbers one through six. Many games require players to toss (or roll) dice. Depending on the game, players may add the sum of the numbers on the sides facing up when the dice land, or they may try to get doubles (the same number on both pieces.)\n\nDie is the singular form of dice. It comes from the French word des, a plural word for the same objects. In English, the most common way to make nouns plural is to add an S. If die followed that rule, its plural form would be dies. However, English is full of irregular plurals. Along with wolf, cactus, and appendix, die does not follow the normal pattern. The plural form is dice. If you roll dice, you are rolling two or more game pieces. If you roll a die, you are only using one piece.\n\nThis Kata will involve the creation of a function to return the value of the throw of 1 or more Die having 2 or more sides.  \n\nfor example the roll of one common casino die having 6 sides, can have the following output with an equal probability.\n{1,2,3,4,5,6}\n\nThrowing two (2) six (6) sided casino dice can have the following\nresult {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}\n\nIn this Kata, the goal is to define a function that computes (fairly) the results of the throw of 1 to N Die, with each Die having a specific set of sides (2 or more)",
