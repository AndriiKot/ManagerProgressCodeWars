    "description": "A huge of prisoners are going to be executed, but there is an only chance to survive.\n\nThe king, called Josephus, asks them to line up and count off, it means the first prisoner report 1, the second report 2, and keep going until the last. Once the prisoner reports an `odd number`, then sadly he would be executed immediately.\n\nAfter a round of counting, the remaining prisoners still have to count off from 1, 2, ... again, and the execution won't stop until the last prisoner survived.\n\nAssuming you are an extremely clever prisoner, which number would you chooce in the first round, and make sure you are the last lucky guy who successfully survived in slim chance.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nluckiest_prisoner(5) = 4\n```\n\nExplaination:\n\n1st round: 5 prisonsers(`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`, `p5`) start count off `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`\n\n- `p1`, `p3`, `p5` are executed in order and `p2`, `p4` are survivals\n\n2nd round: suvivals(`p2`, `p4`) start count off `1`, `2`\n\n- `p2` should report `1` and is executed immediately\n\n- the last survival is `p4`, who report `4` in the first round\n\n\nNote: The population in this kingdom is really large, and they are definitely not in Earth.\n\n",
