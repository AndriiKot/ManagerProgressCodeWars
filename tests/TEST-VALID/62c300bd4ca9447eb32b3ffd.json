    "description": "Given a list of size \"n\" of any type of comparable elements and an order \"m\" in [1..n] inclusive, determine in which position is stored the element that would occupy the m-th position if the list were ordered .\n\nIt is ensured that m < n.\n\nIt must be ensured that for a list of 10^6 elements, the execution time is less than 500ms.\n\nDuplicate items are not allowed\n\nNote that the order starts at position 1 but the list starts at 0.\n\nExample\n\n* [2,1,5,6,3,4], 3 \n-> sol is 4 because in order ([1,2,|3|,4,5,6]) the 3rd elements is a \"3\", that is in position 4 in the original one.\n\n* [\"j\",\"a\",\"h\", \"l\"], 1 \n-> sol is 1 because the order of the original list is ([|\"a\"|, \"h\",\"j\",\"l\"]), \"a\" is in the first position, that is in position 1 in te original one.",
