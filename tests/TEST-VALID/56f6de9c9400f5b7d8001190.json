    "description": "An integer triangle is one which its side values ```a, b, c``` are integers.\n\nAs all the triangles, the values sides fulfills the condition ```a > b + c```, if ```a``` is the greater side\n\nThe perimeter ```p``` of the triangle is such that ```p = a + b + c```.\n\nWhen ```p = 7```, we have the lowest perimeter in having more than ```1``` integer triangle and are  ```[3, 2, 2], [3, 3, 1]``` and the amount of them is ```2```.\n\nDoing some math we may demonstrate that the amount of integer triangles ```n``` will be equal to:\n\n- if ```p``` is even, the closest integer to ```p²/48```\n\n- if ```p``` is odd, the closest integer to ```(p+3)²/48```\n\nWe need a function, that may give the smallest perimeter that has more integer triangles than a given amount.\n\nFot our example\n```python\nint_triang(1) == [[[3, 2, 2], [3, 3, 1]], 2, 7]\n```\nFor the amount 2 and 3 will be:\n```python\nint_triang(2) == [[[3, 3, 3], [4, 3, 2], [4, 4, 1]], 3, 9]\n\nint_triang(3) == [[[4, 4, 3], [5, 3, 3], [5, 4, 2], [5, 5, 1]], 4, 11]\n```\nNote that each triangle ```[a, b, c]``` is such that ```a ≤ b ≤ c``` and the triangles should be sorted.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
