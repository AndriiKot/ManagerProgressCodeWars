    "description": "You are given a stack of boarding cards for various transportations that will take you from a point A to point B via several stops on the way. All of the boarding cards are out of order and you don't know where your journey starts, nor where it ends. Each boarding card contains information about seat assignment, and means of transportation (such as flight number, bus number etc).\n\nBla bla bla...\n\nIn this simplified kata your need to write sort method for array with order from first `Departure` to last `Arrival`.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nInput array (unsorted)\n\n```php \n[\n  [\n    \"Departure\" => \"Stockholm\",\n    \"Arrival\" => \"New York\"\n  ],  \n  [\n    \"Departure\" => \"Madrid\",\n    \"Arrival\" => \"Barcelona\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"Departure\" => \"Gerona Airport\",\n    \"Arrival\" => \"Stockholm\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"Departure\" => \"Barcelona\",\n    \"Arrival\" => \"Gerona Airport\"\n  ]\n];\n```\n\nOutput array (sorted)\n```php\n[\n  [\n    \"Departure\" => \"Madrid\",\n    \"Arrival\" => \"Barcelona\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"Departure\" => \"Barcelona\",\n    \"Arrival\" => \"Gerona Airport\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"Departure\" => \"Gerona Airport\",\n    \"Arrival\" => \"Stockholm\"\n  ],\n  [\n    \"Departure\" => \"Stockholm\",\n    \"Arrival\" => \"New York\"\n  ]\n];\n```\n",
