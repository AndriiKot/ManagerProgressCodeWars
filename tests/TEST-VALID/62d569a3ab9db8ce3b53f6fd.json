    "description": "It's my birthday, so I baked a cake. Also, I've invited you to come over and celebrate it with me.\n\nI cut it up into slices, but I have forgotten to buy whipped cream so I am headed over to the shop leaving you alone with the cake. \n\nYou start looking and the cake and decide that you can no longer wait, and take a microscopic bite from one of the slices. \nThe taste of the cake is so sweet that it makes you feel like flying... Like nothing could ever go wrong again.\n It's so delicious that you then eat half of the slices plus one. You start feeling bad about yourself, but you already tasted it and it's so good... You then decide to eat half of the remaining slices plus one. You shouldn't have done that, now your body aches from all of the sugar consumption. But you decide that you are going to eat half of the remaining slices plus one again. What a frenzy... There's not much left. You only live once. For a final time, you eat half of the remaining slices plus one, after which point the cake is finished. There is nothing left but crumbs on the plate.\n\nYou still have your mouth full of cake and some chocolate frosting on your face when I open the door.\n\nI can't believe what I am seeing, I don't even get mad... I only have one question.\n\nHow many slices were to start with?",
