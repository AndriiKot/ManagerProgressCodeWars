    "description": "Tiny Tony is a pirate, and he wants to grow a beard. \n\nTiny tony has an ideal beard length in mind, and he knows exactly how fast his beard grows. Tiny Tony also believes that by shaving, he can make his beard grow faster.\n\nFor every day Tiny Tony shaves his beard, instead of just letting it grow. His Beard Growth Speed will be increased. We will call this value the Shave Bonus\n\nUsing Beard Growth Speed, Shave Bonus, and Desired Beard length, please caculate the how it is possible for Tiny Tony to get the beard he wants and return the shaves and days taken like so\n\n```['1 shave', '4 days']```\n\nTony cares about words being properly pluralised, so please be careful. \n\nIf there is no way for Tony to get his beard, please return\n```'Impossible'```\n\nIf there are several possible ways to solutions, please return the one with the least amount of shaves required.",
