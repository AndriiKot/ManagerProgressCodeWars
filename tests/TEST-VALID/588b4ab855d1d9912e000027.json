    "description": "This kata is part of the collection [Mary's Puzzle Books](https://www.codewars.com/collections/marys-puzzle-books).\n\nMary brougt home another puzzle book today, and this time it is full of **palindrome sentences!** However, not every phrase is a palindrome, and she needs your help to find all of the actual palindromes.\n\nA word is a palindrome if it is spelt the same when written forwards or backwards. A sentence is a palindrome if it is spelt the same forwards or backwards, *ignoring all spaces, capitals, and punctuation.*\n\nAn example of a valid palindrome sentence:\n```\nphrase           --> \"Was it a cat I saw?\"\nphrase backwards --> \"?was I tac a ti saW\"\n```\nNotice how, although the phrase and the phrase backwards are *not* equal strings, the phrase is actually a palindrome.\n\nAn example of a fake palindrome sentence:\n```\nphrase           --> \"Madam, I am Adam.\"\nphrase backwards --> \".madA ma I ,madaM\"\n```\nAlthough these strings are similar, the order of their letters is actually slightly different, so it is not a palindrome sentence.\n\n## Your job\n\nCreate a function ```is_palindrome_sentence``` that tests if a sentence is a palindrome. It takes one input (a string) and returns ```True``` or ```False```.\n\n**NOTES:**\n\n- The punctuation that may appear are: ```!?.,'/```\n\n- The input will always be a string. (No need to test inputs)\n\n- The input could be an empty string: ```\"\"```",
