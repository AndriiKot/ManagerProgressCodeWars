    "description": "Singapore airport is fantastic. It has free leg massaging machines all over the place to massage your tired travellers legs. The sad thing, however, is that they are always taken.\n\nWhen you see one of these things free it is like a stand off as everyone eyes up the competition to assess whether they could beat them to the machine in an all out sprint. \n\nIt is your task to see if you could. \n\nThere will be you and two other tourists.... each has a distance from the machine, and a maximum running speed. You have (yd) and (ys), and the others have (t1d), (t1s), (t2d), (t2s) in each case d stands for distance (metres) and s stands for speed (metres per second).\n\nYou will also be given another value (broken) that is a boolean. If this is true, the first runner finds the machine is broken and it is then a straight sprint to a different machine. In this case, return the fastest runner (y, t1 or t2).\n\nIf broken == false, return the person who gets to the machine first.\n\nAll inputs are valid.\n",
