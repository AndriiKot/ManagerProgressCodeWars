    "description": "*\"In mathematics, linear interpolation is a method of curve fitting using linear polynomials to construct new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points.\"* - Wikipedia\n\nIn simpler terms, linear interpolation (or \"lerp\" for short) is when you find the coordinates of a point that lies on a straight line between two other points.\n\nYou are given two color codes in hexadecimal format, `color_1` and `color_2`. Your task is to find the hex color code that lies between these two colors, at distance `d` away from the first color.\n\nWhen `d = 0`, the desired color code has no distance from `color_1`, so you should simply return `color_1`.\n\nSimilarily, when `d = 1`, you should just return `color_2`.\n\n`d` can be any value from 0 to 1. The larger its value, the further away from `color_1` the desired color is and the closer it is to `color_2`. For example, `d = 0.5` means the desired color is exactly between the two given colors, whereas `d = 0.9` means the color is very close to `color_2`.\n\nIf the given color codes are not in hexadecimal format, return the message `\"Invalid color codes\"`. You can assume that `d` will always be in the range `0 <= d <= 1`.\n\nMake sure to round any values you use in your output to the nearest integer, or up if a value is equally close to two integers. Your output should also be in hexadecimal format.\n\nSome examples:\n```python\nhex_color_lerp(\"abcdef\", \"a\", 0.5) -> \"Invalid color codes\"\n\nhex_color_lerp(\"#abcde\", \"gggggg\", 0.5) -> \"Invalid color codes\"\n\nhex_color_lerp(\"000000\", \"ffffff\", 0.5) -> \"808080\"\n\nhex_color_lerp(\"000000\", \"ffffff\", 0.2) -> \"333333\"\n\nhex_color_lerp(\"a1b2c3\", \"6f5e4d\", 0.77) -> \"7a7168\"\n```\nGood luck!",
