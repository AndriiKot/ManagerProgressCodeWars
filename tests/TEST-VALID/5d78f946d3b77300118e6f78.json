    "description": "For this kata you will be given a 2D `n x m` matrix and will need to return True/False if the matrix `percolates`.\n\nA matrix percolates if any node in row `0` can reach any of the nodes in row `n - 1` via a continuous path of active nodes. For the purpose of this Kata, paths that head back 'upwards' are considered invalid. We obey the Laws of Gravity in this kata.\n\nAn active node will be marked with a 1, an inactive node will be marked with a 0.\n\nAn example of a 4x4 matrix that percolates looks like:\n\n```\nmatrix = [\n  [1, 0, 0, 0],\n  [1, 0, 0, 0],\n  [1, 1, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 0],\n]\n```\n\nThis percolates as there is a continuous active path from `[0][0]` to `[3][1]`.\n\nie. `[0][0] -> [1][0] -> [2][0] -> [2][1] -> [3][1]`\n\nOnly direct neighbours can be accessed from a node, so diagonal connections do not count.\n\nThe above matrix with `[2][0]` deactivated does not percolate.\n\n```\nmatrix = [\n  [1, 0, 0, 0],\n  [1, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 0],\n]\n```\n\nThere are 2 paths `[0][0] -> [1][0]` and `[2][1] -> [3][1]` but they do not connect up.\n\n```\nmatrix = [\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n]\n```\n\nThis matrix would be considered invalid as the path reverses back on itself and heads upwards again.\n\nTests will cover `2 <= n <= 3000` `2 <= m <= 5000` including 100 random tests.\nTwo additional cases with `n|m == 10000` have been added for performance testing.\n\nYour solution should not mutate the provided matrix, this will be checked in the tests.",
