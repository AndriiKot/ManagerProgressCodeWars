    "description": "Newton's second law states that force is proportional to what is required for an object of constant mass to change its velocity. This is equal to that object's mass multiplied by its acceleration.\n\n```\nForce Equation: F = m.a\n```\n\n\nWrite 3 functions:\n\n(1) Find force (F) with given mass of an object (m) and acceleration (a)\n\n(2) Find mass of an object (m) with given force (F) and acceleration (a)\n\n(3) Find acceleration (a) with given force (F) and mass of an object (m)\n",
