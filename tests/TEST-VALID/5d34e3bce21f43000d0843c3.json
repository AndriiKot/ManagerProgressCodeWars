    "description": "Given a primary and a secondary list, merge them with an inset telling how many items of the primary list should be added before adding one of the secondary list.\n\nSo lets say, given the lists `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']` and `[1, 2]` and the inset value `2`, the merged list should be equal to `['a', 'b', 1, 'c', 'd', 2]`.\n\nBut there are some other rules:\n\n1) Primary list is very important, and if the secondary list runs out of items, we keep adding primary list's items. So if primary list is `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`, secondary list is `[1]` and inset is `2`, the expected result should be `['a', 'b'. 1, 'c', 'd', 'e']`.\n\n2) Secondary list is not so important, and we never want to see two items of it together. If primary list is `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`, secondary list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and inset is 2, we expect `['a', 'b', 1, 'c', 'd', 2]`.\n\n3) If primary list is empty, the result should also be an empty list.",
