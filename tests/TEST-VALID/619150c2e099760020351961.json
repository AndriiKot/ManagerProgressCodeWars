    "description": "In this kata we're going to implement an interpreter for a simple programming language named [Befunge]. It's based on [this kata], but provides a more detailed test suite to allow you to test-drive your implementation.\n\n## Approach\n\nThis kata is set up to use a test-driven development (TDD) approach. Each iteration of the process looks like:\n\n- **Red** - write a failing test\n- **Green** - write the simplest code that gets the test to pass\n- **Refactor** - clean up the code, keeping all of the tests passing\n\nIt can be difficult when you're new to TDD to plot a course through all of the possible functionality and write high quality tests, so the full test suite is already provided. That means that the **Red** step here is actually: delete the next `.skip` to enable the  next test (the first test is already enabled, so your first action will be to write some implementation to get it passing).\n\n## Stack\n\nA Befunge interpreter stores state in a data structure called the _stack_. The [stack] is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) collection that needs to support two operations\\*:\n\n- **Push** a value to the top of the stack:\n    - `[ 1 2 3 ]` -> push a `4` to the top -> `[ 1 2 3 4 ]`\n- **Pop** a value from the top of the stack:\n    - `[ 1 2 3 ]` -> pop the `3` from the top -> `[ 1 2 ]`\n    - `[ ]` -> pop from an empty stack gives `0` -> `[ ]`\n\nIn this case we're not going to worry about the maximum size of the stack. The stack must _always_ contain numbers - don't store any strings in it.\n\n\\* _The stack you use may support other operations, but these are the only two that Befunge requires._\n\n## Code\n\nBefunge code is a series of characters on a 2D grid. This is represented in our tests as a string, e.g. the `\"74 |\\n   @\\n   #\\n   .\"` represents the code:\n\n| ↓ y \\ x → | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 0 | `7` | `4` | ` ` | <code>&#124;</code> |\n| 1 | ` ` | ` ` | ` ` | `@` |\n| 2 | ` ` | ` ` | ` ` | `#` |\n| 3 | ` ` | ` ` | ` ` | `.` |\n\n## Interpreter\n\nBy default, the interpreter traverses the code from left to right, starting with the first character of the first row (x=0, y=0). Each character is an \"instruction\" that controls the behaviour of the program. Each step of the program runs as follows:\n\n- Read the instruction from the current location\n- Execute the instruction\n- Move to the next location based on the current direction\n\nIf the new location is out of bounds, either horizontally or vertically, the interpreter \"wraps\" back around to the other side of the code.\n\nThe full instruction set is listed below, but to run through one of the examples from the test suite (from level 4, _\"can conditionally move vertically\"_):\n\n 0. Start:\n\n    ```none\n    [7]4   |\n           @\n           #\n           .\n    ```\n    Direction: `→`, stack: `[ ]`, output: `\"\"`\n\n 1. Push `7` to stack then move right:\n    ```\n     7[4]  |\n           @\n           #\n           .\n    ```\n    Direction: `→`, stack: `[ 7 ]`, output: `\"\"`\n\n 2. Push `4` to stack then move right\n    ```\n     7 4[ ]|\n           @\n           #\n           .\n    ```\n    Direction: `→`, stack: `[ 7 4 ]`, output: `\"\"`\n\n 3. Do nothing then move right\n    ```\n     7 4  [|]\n           @\n           #\n           .\n    ```\n    Direction: `→`, stack: `[ 7 4 ]`, output: `\"\"`\n\n 4.  Pop `4` from stack, change direction to up then move up (wrapping around)\n    ```\n     7 4   |\n           @\n           #\n          [.]\n    ```\n    Direction: `↑`, stack: `[ 7 ]`, output: `\"\"`\n\n 5. Pop `7` from stack, send to output then move up\n    ```\n     7 4   |\n           @\n          [#]\n           .\n    ```\n    Direction: `↑`, stack: `[ ]`, output: `\"7\"`\n\n 6. Skip one cell in the current direction then move up\n    ```\n     7 4  [|]\n           @\n           #\n           .\n    ```\n    Direction: `↑`, stack: `[ ]`, output: `\"7\"`\n    \n 7. Pop `0` from stack, change direction to down then move down\n    ```\n     7 4   |\n          [@]\n           #\n           .\n    ```\n    Direction: `↓`, stack: `[ ]`, output: `\"7\"`\n    \n 8. End program and return output -> `\"7\"`\n\n## Instruction set\n\nThe table below shows the full instruction set, in the order it's introduced by the test cases.\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Instruction</th>\n      <th>Description</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Level 1</strong> -
