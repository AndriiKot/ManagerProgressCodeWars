    "description": "Two players play a simple game. Each player is provided with a box with balls. First player's box contains exactly: \n ```\nn1\n```\n balls \n\nand second player's box contains exactly:\n ```\nn2\n```\n balls \n\n  In one move first player can take from 1 to k1 balls from his box and throw them away. Similarly, the second player can take from 1 to k2 balls from his box in his move. Players alternate turns and the first player starts the game. \n\n   The one who can't make a move loses. Your task is to determine who wins if both players play optimally!",
