    "description": "When I started working for my company, I was tasked with recording all users activity in our redactor - click, move, keypress, everything.\nAnd i had to create algorithm which had to understand which changes there were in string after user action and write their down like object with properties:\nindex - index where started change string,\nadd - symbols which was added,\ndeleted - symbols which was deleted.\nUser could copy and paste text in editor that's why you have to handle cases with added more than 1 symbol\nfor example:\n\nfindDifferent('Hello, world!', 'Harry, world!') => {\n  index: 1,\n  addedText: \"arry\",\n  deletedText: \"ello\"\n}\n\nUser click mouse from position 1 and select text 'ello' and paste text arry.\n\nthat's why function have to return {index: 1, addedText: \"arry\", deletedText: \"ello\"}\n\nfindDifferent('It is hard task', 'It is easy task') => {\n  index: 6,\n  addedText: \"easy\",\n  deletedText: \"hard\"\n};\n\nfindDifferent('My first task', 'My second task for you') => {\n  index: 3, \n  addedText: \"second task for you\", \n  deletedText: \"first task\"\n}\n\nif two string are the same then function has to return false.\n\nfindDifferent('The same text', 'The same text') => false;",
