    "description": "This kata serves as a more general case of <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/525caa5c1bf619d28c000335/python\">this one</a>. If you didn't - you probably should start with solving it first.\n\n<h3>Intro</h3>\n\nOK, checking for a state of the game in 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe (TTT for short) is easy, but how about 4x4? 20x20? 100x100? 1000x1000? Obviously, there's a reason why TTT board is 3x3 - it's the perfect size for a quick, simple game; anything larger than that would change the game to a boring, ridiculously elongated and almost impossible to win caricature. But what does it matter to a computer?\n\n<h3>Task</h3>\n\nAs you probably guessed by now - the task of this kata is very similar to the original one, the only difference being the board size. The function should accept a single argument, `board`, which will be a NxN list (`3 <= N <= 1500`), like this one:\n```\n[[0, 0, 1],   # 0 - empty\n [0, 1, 2],   # 1 - X\n [2, 1, 0]]   # 2 - O\n```\nwhich represents a state of a TTT game, in the above case:\n```\n- - X\n- X O\nO X -\n```\nand return a single integer:\n- `-1` if the board is not yet finished (there are empty spots),\n- `1` if \"X\" won,\n- `2` if \"O\" won,\n- `0` if it's a cat's game (i.e. a draw) - no further moves are possible.\n\n<h3>Details</h3>\n\nWe will generalize the winning conditions to be the same for every size of the board, so: any full horizontal row of a single symbol, any full vertical row of a single symbol and any of the two diagonals full of a single symbol. For a standard 3x3 there are 8 winning states (3 horizontals, 3 verticals and 2 diagonals), and we can easily see that for a NxN game this number is 2*N+2.\n\nAs you may expect, the size of the board quickly disqualifies the simpler, iterative algorithms, so you probably need to be a little more creative to pass the tests.",
