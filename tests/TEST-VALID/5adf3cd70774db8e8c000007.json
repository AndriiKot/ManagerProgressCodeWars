    "description": "[Arthur Porges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Porges) was mostly known to be a novelist, but he also wrote a small paper about the mathematical hypothesis stating that recursively summing the squares of the digits of any number will either end up to 1 or go on cyclically.\n\nYour task is to write a simple function that tell return the first number of any cycle, `-1` otherwise:\n\n```c\nporges_cycle(1) == -1 // it stays 1, it is not considered a cycle\nporges_cycle(2) ==  4 // the cycle starts with 4, then 16, then 37, then 58, etc going back to 4 in 8 moves\nporges_cycle(4) ==  4 // same as above, just one less step\nporges_cycle(7) == -1 // 7=>49=>97=>130=>10=>1, no cycle!\nporges_cycle(9) == 37 // a cycle occurs, try to find it!\n\n```\n```javascript\nporgesCycle(1) === -1 //it stays 1, it is not considered a cycle\nporgesCycle(2) === 4  //the cycle starts with 4, then 16, then 37, then 58, etc going back to 4 in 8 moves\nporgesCycle(4) === 4  //same as above, just one less step\nporgesCycle(7) === -1 //7=>49=>97=>130=>10=>1, no cycle!\nporgesCycle(9) === 37  //a cycle occurs, try to find it!\n\n```\n```cpp\nporgesCycle(1) == -1 //it stays 1, it is not considered a cycle\nporgesCycle(2) == 4  //the cycle starts with 4, then 16, then 37, then 58, etc going back to 4 in 8 moves\nporgesCycle(4) == 4  //same as above, just one less step\nporgesCycle(7) == -1 //7=>49=>97=>130=>10=>1, no cycle!\nporgesCycle(9) == 37  //a cycle occurs, try to find it!\n\n```\n```python\nporges_cycle(1) == -1 #i#t stays 1, it is not considered a cycle\nporges_cycle(2) == 4  #the cycle starts with 4, then 16, then 37, then 58, etc going back to 4 in 8 moves\nporges_cycle(4) == 4  #same as above, just one less step\nporges_cycle(7) == -1 #7=>49=>97=>130=>10=>1, no cycle!\nporges_cycle(9) == 37  a cycle occurs, try to find it!\n\n```\n```ruby\nporges_cycle(1) == -1 #i#t stays 1, it is not considered a cycle\nporges_cycle(2) == 4  #the cycle starts with 4, then 16, then 37, then 58, etc going back to 4 in 8 moves\nporges_cycle(4) == 4  #same as above, just one less step\nporges_cycle(7) == -1 #7=>49=>97=>130=>10=>1, no cycle!\nporges_cycle(9) == 37  a cycle occurs, try to find it!\n\n```\n```crystal\nporges_cycle(1) == -1 #i#t stays 1, it is not considered a cycle\nporges_cycle(2) == 4  #the cycle starts with 4, then 16, then 37, then 58, etc going back to 4 in 8 moves\nporges_cycle(4) == 4  #same as above, just one less step\nporges_cycle(7) == -1 #7=>49=>97=>130=>10=>1, no cycle!\nporges_cycle(9) == 37  a cycle occurs, try to find it!\n\n```",
