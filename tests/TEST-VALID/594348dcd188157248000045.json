    "description": "Define three functions:\n\n* a function named `capitalize_string` which takes an input string and returns an identical string but with the first letter capitalized and all other letters lowercased;\n\n* a function named `capitalize_words` which takes an input string and returns an identical string but with the first letter of every word capitalized and all other letters lowercased.\n\n* a function named `capitalize_sentences` which takes an input string and returns an identical string but with the first letter of every sentence capitalized and all other letters lowercased. Here we consider each sentence to be ended by a period, a question-mark or an exclamation mark, and we consider a new sentence to begin with the first non-whitespace character (including newlines as whitespace).\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nIn [0] capitalize_string(\"This is a test. This is only a test.\")\nOut[0] 'This is a test. this is only a test.'\nIn [1] capitalize_words(\"This is a test. This is only a test.\")\nOut[1] 'This Is A Test. This Is Only A Test.'\nIn [2] capitalize_sentences(\"This is a test. This is only a test.\")\nOut[2] 'This is a test. This is only a test.'\n```",
