    "description": "<h1>Once upon a time there were the 3 little pigs</h1>\n\neach of them used to send a letter to his brothers every day to inform them of their movements. But one bad day the bad wolf discovered how to find them all, just read the messages that the postman racapitava to the post box.\n\nrisk the way that day, the most intelligent of pigs then one day he decided to make a program to his brothers to be able to encode their messages on the track, the thing was appreciated by the brothers who wrote the mail from that band.\n\npurtorppo also this time the wolf discovered that the messages were pure white and having an ASCII table it was easy for him to decode.\n\nat this point the intellect little pig asks you to create a software for him and his brothers\n\nthe pig tells you that it will give the program 2 parameters, a random message `stream` consisting of `N` bytes and random bits `data` encoded as an `(N / 8)`-elements long array of bytes.\n\nthe program will have to replace the last bit of each `stream[i]` with the `i`-th bit inside `data`.\n\n### Example:\n\n```\nstream: [11111111,11111111,11111111,11111111,111111111,11111111,11111111,11111111]\ndata:   [10101010]\n\nresult: [11111110,11111111,11111110,11111111,111111110,11111111,11111110,11111111]\n```",
