    "description": "# Harmonious Array\n\nThe famous company Goggle is preparing for its 100th anniversary. All employees and fans of Goggle have formed a large array in Lake View. The array has `R` rows and `C` columns. Every person's height has been measured in centimetres and stored in a 2-D array `heights`.\n\nThe CEO of Goggle values harmony, so he wants the array to be harmonious as well. An array is regarded harmonious, if and only if in each row, the difference between the tallest person and the shortest is no greater than the max `tolerance` of the CEO.\n\nThe original array might not be harmonious. Since there are so many people, it is impossible to make any rearrangements. In order to please the CEO, you need to find the largest harmonious subarray in the original array. Here, a subarray is obtained by choosing an axis-aligned subrectangle from the original array.\n\nSince the CEO does not have much time to listen to your reports, you only need to report the head count of the largest harmonious array.\n\n## Input\n\n- a 2-D int array `heights`, representing the height of each person. (For all test cases, `R`, `C`  <= 500)\n- an int `tolerance`, representing the upper limit of allowed difference between the tallest and the shortest person in each row.\n\n## Output\n\n- an int `headCount`, representing the head count of the largest harmonious array.\n\n## Credit\n\nThis Kata is ported from Goole KickStart 2019 Round C.",
