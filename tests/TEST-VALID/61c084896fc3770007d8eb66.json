    "description": "You are given a RGB or RGBA string in the format \"#RRGGBB\" or \"#RRGGBBAA\".\n\nWrite a function that returns an array of bytes with these informations: [D,R,G,B[,A]]\n\nWhere:\n\n**D** ... Mixing Depth - This value ranges from 0..2 and means:\n\n  - 0.. Pure Color (Zero Color Channels Mixed) - At least 2 of the RGB bytes had a value of zero\n  - 1.. Mixed Color 1st Degree (1 Color Channel Mixed) - Exactly one of the RGB Bytes has a value of zero\n  - 2.. All three of the RGB Bytes had a non-zero value\n\n**R,G,B** contains the binary representation of the R-G-B channels of the input string\n\n**A** ... The fifth Byte may only be returned, if the input string contained an alpha channel.\n\nThe input string has always a length of 7 or 9 characters, you do not need to check this.\nThe first character is always a #-Character, which is one of the standard formats for rgb-strings.\n\n**Note:** #000000 returns a depth of 0! (AT LEAST two of the RGB bytes have a zero value).\n\n## Examples ##\n\"#001100\" should return [0, 0, 17, 0]  (4 Bytes, Zero depth because pure green (R,B are zero), length of 4 bytes because the input string contained no alpha channel)\n\n\"#1200AF80\" should return [1, 18, 0, 175, 128] (5 Bytes, Depth 1 because R and B are non-zero, the fifth byte included because an alpha channel was present)",
