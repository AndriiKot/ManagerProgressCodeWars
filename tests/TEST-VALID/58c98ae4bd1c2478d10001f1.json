    "description": "Suppose all numbers from 2 to 99 are placed in a hat. Two numbers are randomly drawn and Peter is told the product of the two numbers, and Simon the sum. \n\nPeter turns to Simon and says:\n\n\"I don’t know what the two numbers are.\"\n\nSimon: \"I knew you didn’t. Neither did I.\"\n\nPeter: \"I do now.\"\n\nSimon: \"So do I.\"\n\nWrite an SQL query to figure out the two numbers drawn from the hat. You are given a table, ``` nums_in_hat``` which contains one column, ```num```, with the numbers 2 - 99.\n\nThere is only one correct pair and your answer should be in the format \n```sql\n  x   |   y\n------+------\n  n   |   n\n```\n\nWhere x > y.\n\nBonus marks for producing a solution which shows how you worked it out rather than just selecting the answer.  Good luck!",
