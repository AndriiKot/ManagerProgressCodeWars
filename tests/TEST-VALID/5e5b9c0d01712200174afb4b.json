    "description": "Story:\n\nYou should help your robot in its quest to survive. He only knows how to move when you say \"GO UP\", \"GO DOWN\", \"GO LEFT\" or \"GO RIGHT\" Besides there are some items which damage or help your robot.\n\n\n\nTask:\n\nComplete the method move:\n\nGiven an array which expresses the robot's coordinates, x and y: [0,0] and a string, \"GO UP\"; you should return the robot's new position.\n\nExample:\n\n[0,-1] \"GO UP\" -> [0,0]\n\n[99,1] \"GO DOWN\" -> [99,0]\n\n[0,5] \"GO LEFT\" -> [-1,5]\n\n[-1,-1] \"GO RIGHT\" -> [0,-1]\n\nComplete the method lifePoints:\n\nGiven a string which represents the item found by the robot after moving to the new coordinate, and robot's current health, you should return the remaining life.\n\nExample:\n\nHelpful items:\n\n\"💧\" 100 -> 101 (Because water is helpful to put out the fire)\n\"🔧\" 100 -> 101 (Because wrench repairs your robot)\n\"⚙️\" 100 -> 101 (Because a gear improves your robot)\n\nHarmful items:\n\n\"🔥\" 0 -> -1 (Because fire damages your robot)\n\"🌊\" 0 -> -1 (Because a water wave represents a robot's water leakage)\n\"🔌\" 0 -> -1 (Because electric cables are damaged)\n\nNOTE: There could be also other Normal items, which do not change your robot's health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![gameplay4.gif](https://s5.gifyu.com/images/gameplay4.gif)](https://gifyu.com/image/qf3N)\n\n\nThis kata has been inspired by the game \"Go go Fixbot\":\n\nhttps://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/fix-bot-4",
