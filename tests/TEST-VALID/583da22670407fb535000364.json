    "description": "Usually, when you need an IP Address in integer form, you'd split it by its four bytes, merge them into one big 32-bit binary and then convert it to base-10. And that is indeed the proper way to do it, but this exercise isn't about the proper way!\n\nWrite a function that turns that IP Address into a 64-bit integer that *represents that IP Address visually*. In other words, \"remove the dots\" and return the result, except that every byte - apart from the first one - needs to be represented with *three digits* in that integer. A few examples:\n\n```255.255.255.255 => 255255255255```\n\n```1.254.211.216 => 1254211216```\n\n```24.1.55.214 => 24001055214```\n\nThe function takes a string ```IPAddress``` that contains a valid IP Address, so there's no need to check for validity. It has to return a 64-bit integer. Try to solve this without using strings - that includes converting to or from strings - or string arrays!",
