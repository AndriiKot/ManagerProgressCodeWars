    "description": "Write a function that, given a rooted, directed graph, returns true if the graph is an [arborescence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arborescence_%28graph_theory%29) or false otherwise.\n\nA graph is an arborescence if there is exactly one directed path from the root node to every other node. In other words, the graph forms a directed spanning tree.\n\n---\n\nA simple graph node data structure is provided which contains a collection, `Connections`, of all of the nodes that are linked to it. Each node is itself a subgraph.\n\nIn C#, it looks like this:\n\n```csharp\ninterface IGraph\n{\n  IEnumerable<IGraph> Connections { get; }\n}```\n\n# Background Reading\n\n* A [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29) is a set of nodes in which pairs of nodes are connected to each other via a link.\n* A [directed graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph) is a graph in which the links can only be followed in one direction.\n* A [tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28graph_theory%29) is a connected graph without any cycles.\n* A [spanning tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree) is a tree that includes all of the nodes in a graph.",
