If the List contains the day calling the method - return that day.\n\n\nExample:\n```\nvar days = new List<DayOfWeek> { DayOfWeek.Monday, DayOfWeek.Wednesday, DayOfWeek.Thursday };\nvar closestDay = DayOfWeek.Friday.GetNextClosestDay(days);\n// closestDay should equal DayOfWeek.Monday\n\nvar closestDay = DayOfWeek.Wednesday.GetNextClosestDay(days);\n// closestDay should equal DayOfWeek.Wednesday\n```",
