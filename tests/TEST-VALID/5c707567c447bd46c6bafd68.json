    "description": "The main currency in the USA is known as the United States Dollar (USD). You recently took a trip to Europe where the currency is the Euro (EUR). When you got back home you wanted to figure out how much your remaining EUR's were worth in USD. \nGiven the current exchange rate between the USD and the EUR is 1.1363636, write a function that will convert EUR to USD. \n\nDon't forget this is a currency so the result will need to be rounded to the second decimal.\n\n#EXAMPLE: \n`\n\nusd(1) => // 1 Euro ==  '$1.14'\n\nusd(198) => // 198 Euro == '$225.00'\n\n`",
