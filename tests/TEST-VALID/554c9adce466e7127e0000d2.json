    "description": "A polynomial function can be represented by a vector of its coefficients. For instance `p(x) = 5x^3 + 2x + 3` can be described as `(5, 0, 2, 3)`. The latter representation is more 'computational friendly', while the first representation is more human readable.\n \nYour task is to create a `Polynomial` class. The constructor takes an array with the integer coefficients as a parameter. The coefficients array starts with the highest degree.\nFurthermore the class should have a `toString` method which returns the polynomial in a simple human readable form. This means you skip `0` coefficient terms completely and you do not write down `1` coefficients. You also skip The examples should clarify this:\n \n```javascript\nvar poly = new Polynomial([5, 0, 1, 3]);\npoly.toString(); // <- should return 5x^3 + x + 3\n```\n\nIf one element of the array isn't a non-negative integer, the constructor should throw an error. You are provided with a function `assertNonNegativeInt(obj)` which throws an error `\"expected non-negative integer input\"` if invoked with something else than an integer.\n\nDo not forget to upvote if you liked this this kata and/or learned something :-)\n\n**Note:** More on polynomials / polynomial functions: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial",
