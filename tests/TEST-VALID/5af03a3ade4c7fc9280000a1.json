    "description": "You might want to look at my other kata, [Quadratic Enumerator](https://www.codewars.com/kata/quadratic-enumerator-1), for reference on enumerators and a full example of one.\n\nAn arithmetic sequence is one which has a common difference; this value represents the difference between any two continuous elements in the sequence. For example, the sequence [1, 3, 5] is an arithmetic sequence where the common difference is 2.\n\nA geometric sequence is one which has a common ratio, which represents the ratio between any two continuous elements in the sequence. For example, the sequence [1, 3, 9] is a geometric sequence where the common ratio is 3.\n\nA quadratic sequence is one which has a common _second_ difference. Since this is harder to explain, let's take a look at an example.\n\n```\nsequence              3   4   9   18\nfirst differences       1   5   9\nsecond differences        4   4\n```\n\nHere, the second difference is held constant at 4. Therefore, this is a quadratic sequence.\n\nTo determine whether a sequence is arithmetic or geometric, three values are sufficient. But to know whether a sequence is quadratic requires four values.\n\n### Task:\n\nYour task is to write a method called `sequence_enum` that will complete the following:\n\n1. It will take in an array of either three or four elements. It needs to discern whether the sequence is arithmetic, geometric, quadratic, or none of these. If the sequence has three or more elements, _all_ of the first differences/ratios must be equal for the sequence to be classified as either arithmetic or geometric. For geometric sequences specifically, the common ratios must be within 1e-6 of each other for it to be classified as geometric. The same goes for quadratic sequences; both of the second differences must be equal. For a sequence to be classified as quadratic, at least four values must be provided.\n2. If a sequence isn't arithmetic, geometric, or quadratic, it is not a valid sequence and you must return `nil`. Otherwise, return an enumerator that yields values of the sequence one by one. \n\n### Examples:\n\n```ruby\nenum = sequence_enum([1, 2, 3]) # arithmetic sequence starting at 1, with common difference 1\nenum.take(6) # gives us [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nenum = sequence_enum([1, 3, 9]) # geometric sequence starting at 1, with common ratio 3\nenum.take(6) # gives us [1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243]\n\nenum = sequence_enum([3, 4, 9, 18]) # quadratic sequence starting at 3, with first difference starting at 1 and second difference = 4.\nenum.take(6) # gives us [3, 4, 9, 18, 31, 48]\n\nenum = sequence_enum([1, 8, 9, 12]) # not quadratic, arithmetic, or geometric\nenum # is nil\n```\n\nThe tests call `Enumerable#take` and `Enumerable#next`. \n",
