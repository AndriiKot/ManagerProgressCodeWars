    "description": "It is Friday! You want to go home earlier from work, and decide to use your overtime to do just that. There's just one problem: Your overtime is given in decimal hours.\n\nYour job is to write a function that converts a given decimal hour (n) into \"normal\" time (h:mm.ss) so that you can tell exactly when you can go home. \n\n```\nFor example: 8.50 (decimal hour) = 8:30.00 (\"normal\" time)\n```\n\n(Decimal hours are frequently used in accounting for payrolls and hourly billing. Time clocks typically record \nthe time of day in tenths or hundredths of an hour. This is \nintended to make accounting easier by eliminating the need to convert between minutes and hours)\n",
