    "description": "In the game of cricket, for the ODI format, each team bats for 50 overs once. Each over contains 6 legitimate balls. Both teams have 11 players each, where two players from the batting side bats and 11 players cover the ground for the bowling side (1 bowler, 1 wicket keeper and 9 fielders). The batting side scores runs till any one of the two things happen: either 50 overs are complete or they loose 10 wicktets (ie. 10 of their batters have been given in the form of bowled or caught or leg before wicket or runout/stumps).\n\nThe team scoring more runs in their turn wins. For this kata, the following assumptions are to be taken:\n1. The match is complete and not in a running state.\n2. The match is not washed away due to rain.\n3. If both scores the same, its a tie.\n\nFor the entire Cricket Series kata, scores will be represented in the format \"T - R/W (O.B)\" where:\n\nT = Team name ( team name wont contain any of the following \"-\",\"/\",\"(\",\".\",\")\" or digits )\n\nR = Run scored by the team ( only digits )\n\nW = Wickets captured by opponent team ( only digits )\n\nO = Overs competed by opponent team ( only digits )\n\nB = Balls bowled in current over by opponent team ( only digits )\n\nFor example: \"Team A - 196/8 (47.2)\" means \"Team A\" scored 196 runs at the fall of 8 wickets in 47 overs and 2 balls bowled.\n\nThe function winner takes two argumets ie. two scores (as string). It must return the team name of the winner and \"Tie\" if its a tie.\n\nMore katas in this series to follow.",
