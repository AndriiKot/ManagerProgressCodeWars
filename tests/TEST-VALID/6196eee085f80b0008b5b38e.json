    "description": "# Egg Dropping Puzzle (2 eggs only)\n\n## The task:\nYour task is to find the lowest floor, from which a dropped egg will break.\n\n## You can assume:\n* An egg will break if previous one broke from a lower floor.\n* An egg will not break if previous one ddidn't break from a higher floor.\n* The floors are indexed from `0` to `numberOfFloors - 1`.\n* You are always given exactly 2 eggs at the start.\n\n## Requirements\nYour solution needs to meet all 3 requirements:\n* The returned value needs to be the searcher for floor.\n* The number of eggs at the end needs to be higher or equal to 0.\n* The number of guesses can't exeed the maximum (based on the number of floors).\n\n## You are given getters for:\n* `numberOfFloors`: the number of floors.\n* `eggs`: the number of eggs left (can go negative, but won't make the test).\n* `guesses`: array of your previous guesses.\n* `lastBroke`: if the last dropped egg broke.\n\n## How to drop an egg?\nFor this purpose, there is the`dropFrom` method. This method will return `true` if the input given is the index of the searched-for floor. Otherwise, the returned value is `false`. This method will also update the getters accordingly.\n\n## Example:\n```js\nfunction solve(puzzle) {\n  for (let i = 0; i < puzzle.numberOfFloors; i++) {\n    if (puzzle.dropFrom(i)) return i;\n  }\n}\n```\nThis code will try all floors one by one starting from 0. It will return the right answer, but the number of guesses will be too high.\n\n## Links:\n\nMore info about the problem on [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming#Egg_dropping_puzzle) and [brilliant](https://brilliant.org/wiki/egg-dropping/).  \nSimilar kata: [Fabergé Easter Eggs crush test (3 kyu)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54cb771c9b30e8b5250011d4)",
