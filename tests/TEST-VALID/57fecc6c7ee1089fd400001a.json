    "description": "Let's create a mathematical neutral function.\n\nWhat's a mathematical identity function?\n----\nshort explanation: It's a function that returns exactly the same element after performing an operation.\n\nUsually for creatng a group we should define the non empty set E that obviously comprehends some elements.\nFor the group we define a binary operation as a function that receives two elements of the group and returns another element belonging to the group we will call that operation the * operation ( or x the name is not relevant ).\n\nTo consider the group as a group and not only a subset we should have a neutral element, and we will define that neutral element as the element n that when applied the previously defined operation * over n and some element named m will return m for  every element m belonging to E.\nIf a subgroup has some other properties it can be defined as a vectorial space, such as many well known spaces as rational numbers space ( 0.2,8,1216545641 ) or irational number space ( PI number, Euler number, etc )\n\nTask\n---\nYour task is to create a neutral function in the space of the rational numbers R\n",
