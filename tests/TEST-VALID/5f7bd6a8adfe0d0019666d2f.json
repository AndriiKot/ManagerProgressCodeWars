    "description": "# Task\nThere is a function called `mystery()` which takes a string and returns a new string. It is called like this:\n```python\nmystery('Hello world')\n```\n*Note - strings only consist of characters from the Latin/English alphabet and spaces.*\n\nYour task is to try and figure out what exactly this function does, and then replicate it by defining `solved()`.\n\nYou can run several tests by writing lines of code like the following in the Sample Tests Fixture.\n```python\n# to check what the mystery function will return:\nprint(mystery('Hello world'))\n\n# to test your code against the mystery function:\ntest.assert_equals(solved('Hello world'),mystery('Hello world'))\n```\n\n*Note - Remember to remove all comments containing the word 'mystery', or the code will not pass the test suite.*\n",
