    "description": "When working from home, a coder can often treat themselves to a lunchtime beer. Or two... This tastes great, but later in the afternoon can really damage concentration levels.\n\nGiven a piece of work (work) and a number of lunchtime beers (beer), you must return the number of hours the work will take to complete. \n\n*I'm off to get a beer to drink while I finish writing this kata*\n\nThe potential work items and their non-beer timescales look like this:\n\n```\nMini-project --> 3 hours\nProject --> 6 hours\nLarge project --> 9 hours\nNew App --> 12 hours\nRe-factor legacy codebase --> 96 hours\n```\n\nEach working day has 7 hours (to make it easy, and give you a lunch break). 3 hours in the morning, 4 hours in the afternoon (post lunch/beer).\n\nBeer will only slow down work for the rest of the day it is consumed (day 1), the following day the coder will be fresh again.\n\nBeers slows work as follows:\n\n```\n1 --> 10%\n2 --> 20%\n3 --> 35%\n4 --> 50%\n5 --> No more work that day\n```\n\nYou have to return the total amount of hours it will take to complete the given project. \n\n",
