The only rule is that drivers don't have over a minute penalty.\n\nThere are some information provided as an object in array your job is to assign a position to them and arrange based on position.\n\nInput array is arrived based on time they are achived.\nBetter position is taken by racer achieved it earlier.\n\nMake sure the you calculate their ```amended``` time.\n\nResult should look the same\n```\n[{   \n  racerNumber:47,\n  racerName:'Mick Schumacher',\n  qualificationTime: '1:22.248',\n  penalty:0,\n  amended: '1:22.248',\n  startPosition: 1\n},{\n  racerNumber:14,\n  racerName:'Fernando Alonso',\n  qualificationTime: '1:21.069',\n  penalty:5,\n  amended: '1:26.069',\n  startPosition: 2\n}]\n```",
