    "description": "The Collatz conjecture states that all numbers reach 1 using the Collatz sequence. The Collatz sequence goes like this: If the number is even then divide by 2; if the number is odd then multiply by 3 and add 1.\n\nA simple sequence woud go like this:\n\n```\nFor the number 3 \n1. 3 x 3 + 1 = 10\n2. 10 / 2 = 5\n3. 5 x 3 + 1 = 16 \n4. 16 / 2 = 8\n5. 8 / 2 = 4\n6. 4 / 2 = 2\n7. 2 / 2 = 1\n```\n\nCreate a function called `collatzCount` that takes a number and returns the number of steps it takes to get back to 1. Although this problem can be solved without recursion, don't you think it would be more fun with? \n\nYou can expect that the number passed to `collatzCount` will not be less than zero. You can only pass one argument to `collatzCount` and you can only use that variable in the solution. No counting!\n\nThe test cases will expect for your solution to be recursive.",
