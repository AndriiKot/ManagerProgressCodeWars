    "description": "Your job in this kata is to find the average of two letters and output that said letter.\n\nYou will be given two letters (from ASCII printable characters). That is from ASCII value 32 to value 126.\n\nYou will find the average of these two letters, then print it out. \n\nYour input will be letters and output will also be letters.\n\nif the average is a decimal point value __dont round it up__ so if value is 67.5 your output will be 67\n\n\n** Note : max length for code is 30 (the tests only read BF instructions, so feel free to add comments and whitespaces to your code)\n\nDont ask for input more than twice\n\n\n---\n\nExample\n\n```\ngiven two letters A Z output will be M\nthis works like this : A has ASCII value 65 while Z has value 90. their average is 77.5\nyou will print out 77\n```\n\nThis is my first kata so forgive me if something is wrong (if you can find issue i will do my best to fix it.)\n",
