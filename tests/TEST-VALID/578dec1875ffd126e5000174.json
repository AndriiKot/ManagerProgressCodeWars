    "description": "Write a function to calculate how much weight you will gain or lose on your diet.\n\n\n```\nfunction diet(meals, requiredCalories, time)\n{\n}\n```\nThe function will take an array of Meal objects, your daily caloric requirement and a time in days. Your task is to calculate the amount of calories you will get from your food and use that information to see how much your weight will change.\n\n<b>Meal</b> object has three properties:\n\n<b>protein</b>\n\n<b>fat</b>\n\n<b>carbohydrates</b>\n\nEach of those is in grams. Assume the following caloric content per gram of nutrient:\n\n<b>protein</b> - 4 calories per gram\n\n<b>fat</b> - 9 calories per gram\n\n<b>carbohydrates</b> - 4 calories per gram\n\n<b>Note:</b> To lose 1kg of weight, you have to spend 7700 calories.\n\nRound to second decimal place.",
