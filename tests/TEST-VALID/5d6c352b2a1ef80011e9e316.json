    "description": "# RealLife #1: RESTAURANT MENU FORMAT\nThe other day I was creating a menu for my parents restaurant \nas for the tenth time. I was working again in the repetitive task of **separating perfectly the name of the product and the price with dots so it can perfectly fit in one line**. Then I fugured that it can easily be solved by a program. And here we are.\n\n# What do we want?\nImagine you got limited space on a page, in Monospace 12 you can place 30 characters on each line, you will have to use all the space available. \n* If the product name and the price uses more than 30 characters you have no space to place in. \n* If product name and the price uses less than 30 characters you have to fill the gap with dots.\n\nSo, your task is to format ProductName and Price into something like this: \n```\n[CapitalizedProductName][Dots as filler][$Price]\n``` \nAnd join them into a single string separated by **\\n**\n\n# Here is an example:\nA program that given **DATA** (an array like this):\n```\n[[\"PRODUCT\", 1], [\"PRODUCT\", 10], [\"PRODUCT\", 100], [\"PRODUCT\", 1000]]\n```\nand **MX** (max line length) = 30, returns:\n```\nPRODUCT..................$1\nPRODUCT..................$10\nPRODUCT..................$100\nPRODUCT..................$1000\n```\n# String conditions\n* Return each line separated by **\\n** in a single string\n* Separate name and price with dots\n* There is at least one dot\n* Return empty string if there is no data\n* A line never can be longer than **MX**\n* No white spaces at the beginning or ending of product name\n* No white spaces at the end of each line\n* Product name has to be in capital letters\n* Im mexican so i want the **$** symbol before the price\n* If there is no space between name and price, return **None**\n",
