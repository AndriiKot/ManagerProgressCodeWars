I'm just an awesome developer, I know nothing about MMA..\"\n\nDana: \"It's Bruce Buffer, our ring announcer, he's caught a bad case of flu and can't attend tonight's main event. It's such short notice that we can't find another annoucer, so can you write some code that will do the annoucing for us?\"\n\nYou: \"Shiiiiiit! I guess so?!\"\n\nDana: \"Awesome! I will email you the brief\"\n\nClick...\n\n\nEmail From: dana@ufc.com\n\nSubject: Annoucer Brief\n\nHey,\n\nThanks again for helping!\n\nPlease can you write a function that creates a fighter. This function will be our template for all the fighters fighting on tonight's card.\n\nEach fighter has 4 key details: their name, weight, fighting style, and corner. These will be passed as arguments to the function.\n\nYou will need to create a 'profile' function within the fighter function that can be called. This will return a string that announces the fighter's corner, their name, their fighting style, then their weight. \n\nFor example: In the blue corner! We have Conor McGregor, a fighter specializing in striking, weighing in at 155lbs!\n\nWe are counting on you!\n\nThanks,\n\nDana White\nUFC President\n\n",
