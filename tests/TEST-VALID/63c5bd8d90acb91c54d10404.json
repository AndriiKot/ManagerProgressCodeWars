    "description": "Monsters are attacking our base! We need to quickly find the sword worthiest of conquering the attacking monsters! The worthiest sword is the sword that will suffer the least damage after slaying all of the monsters. To calculate the damage a sword takes from slaying a monster first calculate the sum of the ASCII values of the letters in the sword's name. Then, calculate the sum of the ACII values of the letters in the monster's name. The damage is the absolute value of the difference in these two sums.\n\nHere is an example of the math:\n\nLet's say we have a sword named \"Fire Scimitar\" and a monster named \"Dragon\".\n\nTo calculate the damage that the sword takes, we first need to find the total of the ASCII values of the name of the sword (excluding the space):\n\n```Fire Scimitar = 70 + 105 + 114 + 101 + 83 + 99 + 105 + 109 + 105 + 116 + 97 + 114 = 1218```\nThen we find the total of the ASCII values of the name of the monster:\n\n```Dragon = 68 + 114 + 97 + 103 + 111 + 110 = 603```\nFinally, we find the absolute value of the difference between the two totals:\n\n```|1218 - 603| = 615```\nSo the sword \"Fire Scimitar\" takes 615 damage when used to kill the monster \"Dragon\".\n\nYou'll receive an array of swords and an array of monsters. The `worthiestSword` function should return the sword that takes the least damage after slaying all of the monsters. In the event of a tie, you should return the sword with the lowest index in the input array.",
