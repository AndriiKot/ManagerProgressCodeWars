    "description": "You and your colleague work in a lab. The colleague does the dirty job of doing the tests. You, on the other hand, collect and write down the results.\n\nThe results of the tests always come is pairs e.g. ```11 22``` or  ```33 44``` etc.\n\nSo, you store all of them consecutively in a single array - ```[11, 22, 33, 44]```.\n\nThis is all good but...\n\nThe chief of the lab likes to view the results of the tests in the following format with a specified delimiter of his liking. For example:\n\n```'[11:22], [33:44]'```, ```'[55-66], [77-88]'```, ```'[99 & 11], [22 & 33]'``` etc.\n\nYour task:\n\nComplete the function ```chop_it_up \\ chopItUp``` that takes two arguments:\n- an array of positive integers\n- and a string delimiter\n\nand returns the result (as a string) as in the examples above and below.\n\n```chop_it_up([1,2,3,4], \" vs. \")``` --> ```'[1 vs. 2], [3 vs. 4]'```\n\n```chop_it_up([10,20,30,40], \" | \")``` --> ```'[10 | 20], [30 | 40]'```\n\nNotes:\n\n- There's a preloaded list of your chief’s seven favorite string delimiters called: ```delimiters```\n\n- The array of integers that's passed into the function will always be of even length.\n\n- Finally, you don't have to worry about an empty array or a missing delimiter. The minimum array length is ```2``` and there's always a single delimiter.\n",
