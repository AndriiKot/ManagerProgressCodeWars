    "description": "In mathematics, we can calculate the distance between any two things. I have two dogs: Puffy is black (`rgb(0,0,0)`) in color and Wuffy is white(`rgb(255,255,255)`). One boring day, I wanted to calculate the RGB color distance between my two dogs. After some struggle, I kinda did it. Since I was excited on knowing how to calculate it, I wanted to expand the idea and calculate the distance between any two colors between black and white given in `rgb`. Oh man! I am struggling. Here I seek your assistance for doing it right: **rounded to two decimals and as a string.**",
