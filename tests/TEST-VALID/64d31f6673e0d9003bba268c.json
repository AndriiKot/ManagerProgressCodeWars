    "description": "# Task\nThe task requires a function to process a given string of digits and construct a list of numbers that satisfy the following conditions:\n\n- The resulting list must contain a minimum of three numbers.\n- When all numbers are concatenated, they should form the original string. Therefore, the string can only be divided into segments without rearranging the digits.\n- Starting from the third number, each number must be the sum of the two preceding numbers, i.e., `lst[i - 2] + lst[i - 1] == lst[i]`.\n- A number cannot have a leading zero, except when the number itself is zero (e.g., 0 is allowed, but 01 is not).\n- The goal is to find a list of numbers that meets these criteria and return it. If it is not possible to create a sequence resembling the Fibonacci series, an empty list should be returned, [].\n\n\n# Examples\n```python\nsplit_fibonacci(\"11235813\") ➞ [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]\n\nsplit_fibonacci(\"112358130\") ➞ []\n\nsplit_fibonacci(\"123456579\") ➞ [123, 456, 579]\n\nsplit_fibonacci(\"0000\") ➞ [0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nsplit_fibonacci(\"1031316\") ➞ [10,3,13,16]\n```\n# Notes\n- Multiple solutions to some tests are possible. That is why there is a helper function `check_split` in the preloaded section to check that the output list satisfies the requirements. This allows freedom to finding a sequence.\n- First two numbers may not be in order (see last example).",
