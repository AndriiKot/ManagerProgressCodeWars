    "description": "The karaoke star Cat Ning Kole has a particular affection for palindromes, squares, and his personal favorite: palindromic squares.\n\nSo what is a palindromic square? It's an integer number that reads the same forwards and backwards (a palindrome), and is also a square of an integer.\n\nFor example 131 is a palindrome, but it is not a square.\nOn the other hand, 10201 is a palindrome. And it is the product of 101 * 101, so it is also square.\n\nYour job is to help Cat determine if a given number is a square, a palindrome, or best of all a palindromic square.\n\nWrite a function that returns the following song title depending on the input:\n\nIf the input is a square, return the song title 'When I Fall In Love'\n\nIf the input is a palindrome, return the smash hit 'L-O-V-E'\n\nIf the input is a palindrome square, return the unforgettable song title 'Unforgettable'\n\nOtherwise return the lesser known song 'Darlin, je vous aime beaucoup'\n",
