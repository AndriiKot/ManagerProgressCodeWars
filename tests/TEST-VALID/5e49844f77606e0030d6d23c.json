    "description": "Write a function:\n\n```haskell\nestimateSqrt :: Double -> Double\n```\nwhich calculates the square root of any positive ```x :: Double``` to a first approximation\n\nIn the tests, ```x``` will always be greater than zero, but may be very large or very small.\n\nYour results should be accurate to within 10%, so they will be checked by a function something like this:\n\n```haskell\ncheckSqrt :: Double -> Bool\ncheckSqrt x = y <= 1.21 && y >= (recip 1.21)\n              where y = x / (estimateSqrt x)^2\n```\nThe functions ```sqrt``` ```log``` ```exp``` ```sin``` ```cos``` and ```(**)``` have been hidden.\n\nDon't worry, there are still some functions in ```Prelude``` which can help you.\n",
