    "description": "In this kata, you will write a function that calculates and returns how many steps it will take for a positive integer to reach 1 using the Collatz conjecture. If the number is even, divide it by two. If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. In the end, you will always reach 1. Here's an example:\n\n6/2 = 3  3 x 3 + 1 = 10 10/2 = 5  5 x 3 + 1 = 16  16/2 = 8  8/2 = 4  4/2 = 2  2/2 = 1\nThat was 8 steps to reach 1.\n\nIf n is already 1, return 0. If n is 0 or less, return null.\n\nIn case you still don't understand, check out the video that Numberphile made of the Collatz conjecture on YouTube.",
