    "description": "Hey warriors, now is your opportunity to save the ancient city of Troy and change history!\n\n---\n\nSometimes in order to accomplish a task we have to shell out to the system.\n\nWrite a function that returns the output of the `which` linux command for the given filename as argument. The argument either exists as a file or not.\nYou shouldn't have to manipulate the stdout returned by the command.\n\n---\n\nExample:\n\n* argument: `mkdir`\n \n* return: `/bin/mkdir`\n\n---\n\nCode injections are one of the most common vulnerabilities in IT systems. <b>Security is hard</b>, weak code will be punished, trolled and given to the dogs!\n\nEnough said. <b>WARRIOR, ARE YOU READY TO DEFEND TROY !?!</b>",
