    "description": "Your task is to write a function `calculate`, which accepts a string with a mathematical exprssion written in [Polish prefix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation). This means that all operations are placed before their operands. For example, the expression `3 + 5` is written in Polish notation as `+ 3 5`, and `(3 + 5) / (2 * 2)` is `/ + 3 5 * 2 2`.\n\nThe function must return a number resulting from evaluating this expression. Note that operators are applied as they are written, without precedence rules: for example, `* + 2 3 4` computes `+ 2 3 (== 5)` first and `* 5 4` second, while `+ * 2 3 4` calculates `* 2 3 (== 6)` and then does `+ 6 4`.\n\nThe only valid operations are `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`. Because all of them accept exactly 2 arguments, no parentheses are used for grouping. The input string is guaranteed to be a valid expression.\n\n### Examples:\n\n    calculate('+ 3 5') === 8\n    calculate('* + 2 2 3') === 12\n    calculate('/ + 3 5 * 2 2') === 2\n\n### Input:\n\nA non-empty string consisting of numbers and arithmetic operators separated by spaces. This string is a valid arithmetic expression written in prefix polish notation.\n\n### Output\n\nA number, result of evaluation of the expression.",
