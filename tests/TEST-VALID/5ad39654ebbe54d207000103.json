    "description": "Write a function which taken an integer in the range of (-46340, 46340) and returns the square of that integer. Sounds simple, doesn't it?\n\nOh, but you are not allowed to use any of the basic arithmetic operands +, -, \\*, \\*\\* and /. Also the `Math` class is not allowed, same applies for the `eval` function and external libraries.\nFor your sample tests the arithmetic operands are not tested to get you started more easily, but you can not pass with them included.\n\nTo make things a little more compact, just solve this Kata in 200 characters or less. The reference solution has exactly 99 characters, so this should be easy for you! ;-)\n\nThis kata was inspired by: <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/one-line-task-square-a-number-without-star-plus-or-math-dot-pow\" target=\"_blank\">One line task: Square a number Without *, + or Math.pow()</a>",
