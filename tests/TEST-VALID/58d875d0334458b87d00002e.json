    "description": "**Overview**\n---\nYou are asked to create a 3-dimensional structure (a rectangular prism) with dimensions `w` x `h` x `d` using cubes of dimension `y` x `y` x `y`. **However, you want to use as few cubes as possible, and therefore only fill in the outside (visible) layers of the structure, leaving the inside hollow.**\n\n**Objective**\n---\nWrite a function `cubecalc([w, h, d], y)` that will return the minimum amount of cubes you will need to make the structure, or `null` if such a structure cannot be made using cubes of that dimension.\n\nYou will be given the dimensions of the structure (`w`, `h`, and `d`) as an array, and you will be given the side length `y` of a cube.\n\n* You must return the minimum number of cubes (as an integer) needed to create the structure.\n* All dimensions are in whole numbers.\n* If you cannot create the structure with the given cube size, you must return `null`\n* Cubes cannot change shape or size, or be cut into multiple parts.\n\n**Examples**\n---\n```\na 3x3x3 structure requires 26 1x1x1 cubes to build, leaving a 1x1x1 area hollow.\ncubecalc([3, 3, 3], 1) -> 26\n\nan 8x6x10 strucure takes a total of 54 2x2x2 cubes to build\ncubecalc([8, 6, 10], 2) -> 54\n\nthese structures cannot be made\ncubecalc([9, 14, 15], 2) -> null\ncubecalc([1, 1, 1], 10) -> null\n```",
