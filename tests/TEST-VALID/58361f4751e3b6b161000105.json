    "description": "Classic Crypto. Ceasar would send his generals encrypted messages using a simple ROT13 cypher. If the king of Rome can make this algorithm, so can you.\n\nROT13 rotates takes every letter and advances them 13 spaces in the alphabet.\n\na->n<br>\nB->O<br>\nc->p<br>\n...<br>\nZ->M<br>\n\nWrite a function that encrypts an ascii string with the ROT13 cypher.\n\nThis time Caesar wants his generals to be able to use full sentences and punctuation. In English for some anachronistic reason. So today we learn the joy of edgecases.  Have you thought about empty strings, capitalized letters, spaces, and puntuaction?\n\nBonus: try and make a program which turns the cypher back into plaintext.",
