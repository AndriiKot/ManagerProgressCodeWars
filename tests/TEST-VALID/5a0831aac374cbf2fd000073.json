    "description": "# A Caesar Cipher\nA Caesar cipher is one of the most simplest and famous ciphers. It is also known as a shift cipher, where each letter is shifted by a set number of positions.\n\nROT13 is a common example of the Caesar cipher, where each letter has been replaced with a letter 13 places after it in the alphabet (thus ‘A’ becomes ’N’, ‘B’ becomes ‘O’ etc.).\n\n# The Task\nCreate a function that takes an encoded string and the number of positions each letter has been shifted by. Return the decoded string.\n\n* If there are any non-alphabetic characters, return them as they are.\n\n* The encoded string can include a mixture of uppercase and lowercase characters. The decoded string should maintain the relevant case.\n\n* The number (n) can be any number between -25 and 25.\n  * For positive numbers, each letter has been replaced with a letter n places after it in the alphabet. \n```javascript\n decoder('Khoor', 3); //Should return ‘Hello’.\n ```\n  * For negative numbers, each letter has been replaced with a letter n places before it in the alphabet.\n```javascript\ndecoder('Ebiil', -3); //Should return ‘Hello’.\n ```",
