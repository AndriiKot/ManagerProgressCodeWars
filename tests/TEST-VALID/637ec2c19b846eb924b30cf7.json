    "description": "You are a mathematician who was interested in the Collatz conjeture and wants to know what was the maximum value reached by the algorithm proposed by Collatz.\n\nYour job is to find this value using a program.\n\ncollatz conjecture:                \nThe algorithm is simple, if the number entered is EVEN it is divided by two, if it is ODD it is multiplied by three and one is added.",
