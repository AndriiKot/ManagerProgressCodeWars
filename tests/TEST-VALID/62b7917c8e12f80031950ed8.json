    "description": "## Description:\nYou have been given a list of airport IDs ranging from ``` 0-n``` in an array. Along with each ID you also recieve the airport IDs that it connects directly to with one flight. \n#### Note\nThese connections are only one way, meaing that being able to travel from x-y does not mean you can immediately travel from y-x (though it could still be possible depending on the given data).\n## Task\nCreate a function ```airlines``` which, given the airports and their connections, returns the ```minimum```  number of ```new```  connections that you will need to make to be able to travel from any airport ```x```  to any other airport ```y```. The number of airlines it takes to do this does NOT matter.\n## Input\nOne list in the form ```[[a1, a2...], [b1, b2...]...]``` where the index of each sublist is the airport's ```ID``` and each integer in the sublist is the airports that it connects directly to.\n## Example\nGiven the input: \n\n``` [[1], [0, 2], []]```\n\nSomeone can travel directly forom airport ```0 -> 1```; from ```1 -> 0 or 2```; and cannot travel anywhere from airport ```2```. \n\nWe would return ```1``` here because we can add an airline from airport ```2 -> 0``` which then allows us to travel from ```0 -> 1 and 2```, ```from 1 -> 0 and 2``` and ```from 2 -> 0 and 1```.",
