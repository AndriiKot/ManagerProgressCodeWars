    "description": "Given an array of places calculate the shortest distance between each destination to create travel route. A place in the list will look like this: \n``` javascript\n[{ \"city\": \"Vancouver\", \"lat\": 49.2827, \"long\": 123.1207 },...]\n```\n\nThere will always be at minimum two places in the array with attributes as outlined above.\n\nThe order of the list is somewhat important. The first place in the array is your starting point, the last place is the final destination. Every place in between the first and last are subject to reorder for the sake of travelling efficiency. \n\nWe are planning our trip on a map which is flat, so we only need to calculate the distance between two points when calculating an efficient route. No complex geographic calculations will be required here.\n\nThe expected output will be a string of city names in order of the next closest city with the exception of the starting and end place. The output string will be formatted as so:\n``` javascript\n\"Toronto, Houston, Jacksonville\"\n```\n\nThis is not the same as a travelling salesman: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem\n",
