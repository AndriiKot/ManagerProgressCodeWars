    "description": "Write a function that returns an average of all numbers (or strings that are string representations of numbers) found in the arguments. \n  - The function should accept any number of arguments\n  - Any argument that is a number should be considered for the average\n  - Any argument that is a string should only be considered for the average if it is a direct representation of a number i.e. you should ignore any strings that contain any characters other than digits (The negative \"-\" symbol is allowed at the beginning of a string): \n    * '-12' WOULD be considered because it only contains digits and the negative symbol at the beginning of the string\n    * '12-' would NOT be considered because there is a negative symbol in a location other than the beginning of the string\n    * '51' contains only digits (the digits 5 & 1) so we would consider the 51 for the average (see examples below)\n    * '5f' contains characters other than digits, so we would not consider '5f' or any part of the string '5f' for the average\n    * \"'5'\" contains characters other than digits, so we would not consider \"'5'\" or any part of the string \"'5'\" for the average \n    * The string \"[4, 2]\" would not be considered, nor would any part of it since it is not a direct representation of a number\n  \n  \n  - Any argument that is an array should be traversed to find additional numbers/strings that need to be considered for the average. Arrays will be nested multiple levels deep\n  - Any argument that is an object literal should be traversed to find additional numbers/strings that need to be considered for the average. Objects will be nested multiple levels deep\n    *Note: only consider values in the key-value pairs of object literals; ignore any keys that happen to be numbers\n  - 0 and '0' should both be considered for the average i.e. the average of 6, 0, & '0' would be 2\n  - All test cases will contain at least one valid argument that can be considered for the average\n\n\nExamples:\n1. averageEverything(5, 3) // 4 (8 / 2)\n2. averageEverything(5, '3') // 4 (8 / 2)\n3. averageEverything(5, 3, '7g', 'hello') // 4 (8 / 2)\n4. averageEverything(5, 3, 6, '6', 0, '0') // 3.333333... (20 / 6)\n5. averageEverything([6, 0, '0', [2, '2', [10, 8]], 8], 8, 3) // 4.7 (47 / 10)\n6. averageEverything(5, 3, 6, '6', 0, '0', [5, 6, 7, true, false, null, undefined, NaN, '2f3', [8, 3, {name: 'test', a: 10, g: 6, c: false}, []]]) // 5 (65 / 13)\n7. averageEverything({name: 'test2', a: 10, g: 6, c: false}, 5, {nested: {a: 4, b: 6}}) // 6.2 (31 / 5)\n8. averageEverything(1, 2, [3, {a: 4, b: 5}, 6, {c: 7, nested: {d: 8, e: [9, 10]}}, 11]) // 6 (66 / 11)\n\n\nWalk Through Examples:\n\n1. averageEverything( {a: 1, b: \"[4,2]\", c: [5, {d: '6'}]} ) // 4 (12 / 3) \n    - the only argument passed in is an object literal, so we traverse it and check each key/value pair. The value in the first pair, a:1, is a number (1) so we consider that for the average. b is a string that contains characters other than digits, so we do not consider it for the average. c is an array, so we traverse the array and check each index. Index 0 is a number (5) so we consider that for the average. Index 1 is an object literal, so we check each key/value pair. d is a string that contains only digits (the digit 6) so we consider 6 for the average. That leaves us with (1 + 5 + 6) / 3 which equals 4",
