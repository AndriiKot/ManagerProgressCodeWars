    "description": "A country uses an unique 11 digit id number for its citizens. This id number has some characteristics and in this kata you should write a function that takes id number as input, and returns whether it is valid or not.\n\nID number has following characteristics:\n- Never starts with 0\n- Last 2 digits are calculated digits:\n  - 10th digit is remainder from division by 10 of the number calculated by subtracting sum of every even digit from 7 times of sum of every odd digit.\n  - 11th digit is the remainder from division by 10 of the sum of first 10 digits.\n\nExample:\n-\nFor the number 10562272296, first 9 digits are: 105622722\n\nCalculation of 10th digit:\n- Sum of odd digits: 1 + 5 + 2 + 7 + 2 = 17\n- Multiply by 7: 17 * 7 = 119\n- Sum of even digits: 0 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 10\n- Subtracting sum of even digits from 7 times of sum of odd digits: 119 - 10 = 109 \n- Remainder from division by 10: 109 % 10 = 9 gives the 10th digit.\n\nCalculation of 11th digit:\n- Sum of first 10 digits: 1 + 0 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 7 + 2 + 2 + 9 = 36\n- Remainder from division by 10: 36 % 10 = 6 gives the 11th digit.\n\nFor the example both 10th and 11th digits are correct. Hence the validation function should return True.\n\nYou can guarantee input will always be 11 digit number.\n",
