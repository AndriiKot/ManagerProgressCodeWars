    "description": "## Background\n\nA team of researchers has developed a new way of measuring the heights of bridges...by dropping stones!\n\nBy simply measuring the time it takes for the stone to reach the river underneath, they are able to quite accurately measure how tall the bridge is.\n\nHowever, to avoid silly mistakes, they would like your help.\n\n## Task\n\nWrite a function **height_of_bridge** which calculates the height of the bridge (in meters) when given the **time** it takes for the stone to reach the river (in seconds).\n\n## Note\n\nTake acceleration due to gravity (g) as **9.8** m s^-2.\n\n## Hint\n\nAs stones are **dropped**, initial velocity of the stone will be 0 m/s.\n\n## GOOD LUCK!",
