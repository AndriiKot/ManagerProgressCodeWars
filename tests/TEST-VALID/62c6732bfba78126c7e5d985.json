    "description": "## Description\n\nAs a doorman, you see many guests come and go. You've memorized all of their full names, and must greet each and every one of them with the polite Japanese suffix, \"-san\", or you'll lose your job!\n\nGiven a list of guest names, figure out the correct way to greet them. If they have more than one name (eg. a first name and a last name), make sure to only address them by the LAST name in the string. So, \"Hayao Miyazaki\" should be greeted as, \"Miyazaki-san\". But it's okay to greet \"Gandalf\" as simply \"Gandalf-san\".\n\nAnd watch out! Some \"guests\" are actually friendly stray animals just stopping by for head pats. Don't greet them! Your boss will scold you if you do! You can tell the animals apart from the people by the fact that animal names are entirely lowercase.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\ngreetGuests([\"Hayao Miyazaki\", \"Gandalf\"]) => [\"Miyazaki-san\", \"Gandalf-san\"]\ngreetGuests([\"fluffy dog\", \"Samuel L. Jackson\"]) => [\"Jackson-san\"] \n```",
