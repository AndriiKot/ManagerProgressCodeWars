    "description": "You're looking for a new car. Of course you wan't to approach this in a systematic way. You have to implement the evaluateCars function which takes a list of cars and a criteria object as inputs. As a return, a list of all cars satifying the criterias is expected.\n\nConditions:\n- The price should not exceed the maxPrice criteria\n- The power-to-weight ratio is calculated as follows (horsepower/weight)\n- The power-to-weight ratio of the car has to exceed that value from the criteria\n- Multiple colors are allowed as criteria, the cars have to match one of the colors from the criteria\n- Colors are not case-sensitive\n\nObject definitions:\n\nclass Car{\n  private String name;\n  private String color;\n  private int weight;\n  private int horsepower;\n  private int price;\n}\n\nclass Criteria {\n  String[] colors;\n  float powerToWeightRatio;\n  int maxPrice;\n}\n\nThe attributes are private and have to be accessed using GETTER methods.\ne.g. name -> getName, powerToWeightRatio -> getPowerToWeightRatio\n",
