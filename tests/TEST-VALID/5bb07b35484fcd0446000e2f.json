    "description": "There are ```n``` people, and each of them have their own hat. They place their hats on a table, and you have to distribute those hats among the people in any way you like, with each person getting one hat.\n\nHow many ways are there to rearrange the hats among the people such that not even one of them gets their own hat? Or, how many derangements of ```n``` objects are there?\n\nA derangement is a permutation of objects where every object is not in its original position. For example, for the case with the hats above, a derangement of the hats would be a distribution of the hats such that none of the people get their own hat.\n\nYour task is to write a function ```DontGetYourHat``` that has an input of an integer ```n``` and returns the number of derangments of ```n``` objects.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nDontGetYourHat(2) --> 1\nDontGetYourHat(3) --> 2```\n\nIf ```n``` is not positive, return ```0```.\n\nHint:\nFirst try finding the formula for the number of derangements of n obects.",
