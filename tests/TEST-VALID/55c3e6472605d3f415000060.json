    "description": "Wee Tommy Tanker works in a call centre. He needs to set accurate call back dates otherwise he loses his clients trust.\n\nCreate a function that takes a given name, date (first call) and period (time between the first call and the next call). The period can be number of days, weeks or months. Tommy doesn't think arranging a call back in a year is worth it.\n\n e.g  \n \n     callBack('Mr Pink', 15/07/2015,'in 6 days') \n     // so call back Mr Pink  in 6 days.\n     => \"Call back Mr Pink on Tuesday, July 21, 2015\"\n\n     callBack('Mr White', 15/07/2015,'in 1 week') \n     // so call back Mr White in 1 week.\n     => \"Call back Mr White on Wednesday,July 22, 2015\"\n\nThe call centre is located in the UK and closed on Saturdays, Sundays and all public holidays. Your function should account for this and return the next best date to call. \n\nUK Public Holidays 2015\n    \n    01/01/2015\n    03/04/2015 \n    06/04/2015\n    04/05/2015\n    25/05/2015\n    31/08/2015\n    30/11/2015\n    25/12/2015\n    26/12/2015\n    28/12/2015\n    \n",
