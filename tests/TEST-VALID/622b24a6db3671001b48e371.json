    "description": "<h1>not quite python</h1>\n\nAs the title says,<br>\nits not just python that you need to know to complete this kata but also **JS**.\n\n\n<h2>task 1</h2>\n\nyour task is to create a `index.js` file in the current working directory. That file should contain the definition of a function named `reset` taking no arguments and whose role is to print to the standard output the value equal to the sum of the elements in the list passed to your `python function`. Note that this file could/n't already exist.\n\nwell that was the JS part, now on to the python part.\n\nThe Python part of the kata is to make the index.js and return True. **thats all**\n\n\n\n<h2>task 2</h2>\n\nGiven a file in like `abc.js` in parameter, There will be no such case where the task2 file doesnt exists.You can expect that JS file's will only output some data to the console and you have to return the logged content.\n\nif there is any escape sequance in the output, `trim it`\n\n<h2>example</h2>\n\n```python\ntask1([1,2,3]) # returns True but in js logs 6\ntask2(\"Kacarott.js\") # returns Kacarott loves Factor.\n```\n",
