    "description": "We have a family called \"three\" where the family is divisible by 3. So, intruders from five family entered three family secretly. So they need a spy to save their family. \n\nAs a spy, your task is to remove the intruders i.e '5' and check, is it a three family or not. If it belongs to three family return the family without intruders in it else return -1.\n\nExamples of 3 family are [.....,-12,-9-6,-3,0,3,6,9,12,......]\n\n\nExamples:\n\nn = 3 => 3\n\nn = 55 => -1  \n55 cannot be in family of three's\n\nn = -55 => -1  \nAfter removing intruders from -55 we have nothing but '-' which is not the family of three's, so return -1. \n\nn = 6553 => 63  \nAfter removing intruders from 6553 we have 63 which is divisible by 3. simple right ;-)\n\nn = 956451 => -1\n\nfor more examples check testcases.\n\nNOTE : 0 is also considered to be in the family of 3.   \n\nHAPPY CODING :-)\n\n",
