    "description": "Consider the sequence formed by the following steps:\n\n1. Start with ```0```\n2. take a copy of the sequence\n3. Add ```1``` to each value in the copy\n4. Append the copy to the sequence to produce a new sequence, twice as long as the previous one\n\nRepeat steps 2 to 4\n\nSo the sequence will grow as follows in the first few iterations:\n\n```\n[0]\n[0,1]\n[0,1,1,2]\n[0,1,1,2,1,2,2,3]\n```\n\nWrite a function ```getElement``` which will return the n'th element of the sequence:\n\n```haskell\ngetElement 1 -- returns 0\ngetElement 2 -- returns 1\ngetElement 8 -- returns 3\n-- etc\n```\n\nThe tests will include values of n up to 10^100\n",
