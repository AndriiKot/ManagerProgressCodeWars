    "description": "N By N Skyscrapers is the 4th installment in the exciting adventures of producing a solution to the Skyscapers (or Towers) puzzle game.\n\nSkyscrapers is a puzzle where the goal is to solve a Latin square using hints arrayed around the board that give information about the values and/or ordering of values in a row or column. \n\nThe number on each square represents the height of the building on that square. Taller building block to view of smaller buildings.\n\nThe hints around the outside of the row (or column) tell you about the number of buildings that can be seen if looking directly down that row (or column). For example, if a 4-long row had a hint of 2 at the left end and a hint of 3 at the right end, it could be { 1, 4, 3, 2 }, {2, 4, 3, 1} or {3, 4, 2, 1}.\n\n* There is only one answer to a given problem.\n\n* A hint of 0 means no hint, as an ordering of 0 would be impossible.\n\n**Previous Versions**\n\nI would recommend attempting previous Kata's in this series before attempting this Kata. Previous installments include:\n\n4 By 4 Skyscrapers - https://www.codewars.com/kata/5671d975d81d6c1c87000022\n\n6 By 6 Skyscrapers - https://www.codewars.com/kata/5679d5a3f2272011d700000d\n\n7 x 7 Skyscrapers  - https://www.codewars.com/kata/5917a2205ffc30ec3a0000a8\n\nAdditionally, these Kata's provide excellent descriptions of the Skyscrapers problem(I am not as gifted with markdown as the other authors).\n\n\nThis Kata provides a variant on the previous fixed size solutions to the Skyscrapers problem. This Kata requires that you build a solver that can accept solutions with a varying side length, though they will always be square. Additionally, the limit to the problem size has been increased to 15x15. All squares have a single solution. Most squares are partially filled.\n\n",
