    "description": "You receive a value from the third party library. Unfortunately the value is an unsigned byte. Convert it to a integer.\n\nExplanation:\nWhat does unsigned mean? Signed means positiv or negative. In java byte, short, int and long always are signed. This means that the first bit (msb) represents the signe. 0 means it is a positive value, 1 means it is a negative value. \nFor other programing languages this is not always true. They may have unsigned data types. This means they only have a value. If the value of an unsigned data type is provided to a java program, java still thinks the first bit means positive or negative.\n",
