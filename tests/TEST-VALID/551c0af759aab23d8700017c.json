    "description": "Templating isn't that hard if you put your mind to it. Write a function that will compile any code (in the form of a string or function), turning any marked text into a regular string, then running the code and returning the result (a function should become a function, a string will become whatever the expression returns). Text is marked as a \"literal\" by starting with the characters `_/*` and ending with `*/`.\n\n(Don't worry about closures and whatnot with the functions.)\n\n```javascript\ncompile(\"_/* string \\\"with\\\" 'quotes' and \\\\ slashes */\") === \"string \\\"with\\\" 'quotes' and \\\\ slashes \";\n\ncompile(function(url, text) {\n  return _/*<tag>\n    <a href=\"*/ + url + _/*\">*/ + text + _/* \\ (new window)</a>\n  </tag>*/;\n})(\"http://www.google.com/\", \"Google\") === \"<tag>\\n    <a href=\\\"http://www.google.com/\\\">Google \\\\ (new window)</a>\\n  </tag>\";\n```\n\nSee how few lines you can manage to write a fully-working template compiler in without using any libraries whatsoever!",
