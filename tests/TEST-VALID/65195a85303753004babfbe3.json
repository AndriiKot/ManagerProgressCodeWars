    "description": "# Beam Ball Balance\n\n>Ahoy!\n>A small ball sits on a solid beam.  \n>Keep the ball on the beam with naught but a sensor and a knob.  \n>Just read the position and turn the knob!\n\nThe scenario is a virtual, frictionless, and two-dimensional physical system that you cannot see. The beam pivots on a central point connected to a motor. The ball's weight affects rotation force. The ball loses contact with the beam only if it rolls off an end. It is very similar to this: \n\n[Video Example Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEV5Tkr2u3g)\n\nThere are some properties you do not know: \n* Initial beam angle, initial ball position, ball mass, gravity, motor max torque, speeds, accelerations, etc. \n\nThe test is a loop at `10` frames per virtual second. **Your function is called every frame before forces are applied. Use the motorKnob function to keep the position of the ball between 0 and beamLength (left and right ends of beam) for 600 frames (60 virtual seconds).**\n\n`position` is the per-frame distance from the left end of the beam to the center of the ball. Call `motorKnob(power)` to set the motor's power level and direction `-1 to 1`, strong left to strong right and anywhere in between. Beam hard stops at -90 degrees (left) and 90 degrees (right), 0 degrees being level.\n\nJust turn the knob! (Hint: use the position to determine how to set the power.)",
