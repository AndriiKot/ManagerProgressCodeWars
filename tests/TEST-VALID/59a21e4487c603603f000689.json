    "description": "Congratulations! You just got hired as a data analyst for our very important company, ONTIME! At ONTIME! the most important thing is that you get your work done on time! \n\nAt ONTIME! whenever we give you an assignment, we will also give you a deadline! The deadline will be the number of calendar days from today (the codewars current system day), or calendar days from some other date we specify, that the task should be completed. \n\nOne nice thing about the company culture here at ONTIME!: weekends are very important! Nobody works on the weekend, and you should never complete anything on a weekend. If a deadline falls on a weekend, it should be completed the following Monday. \n  \n\nWrite a function `day_due(days)`that takes the deadline (an integer, the number of days from today) and an optional argument `from` and returns the date you actually need to have the task completed. This means if the due date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the function should return the date for the following Monday.  \n\nYour function should return a date object, in the form `\"1970-01-01\"`\n\nA few notes:\n1. If it's Monday and the ONTIME! team says your deadline is 1, that means you need to complete the task on Tuesday. \n2. Though weekends are sacred to us here at ONTIME!, Holidays are for lazy slobs. \n3. The random tests will include negative deadlines (ONTIME! Needed it before the Roman empire fell) and deadlines very far into the future (ONTIME! needs it sometime before the sun swallows the earth).",
