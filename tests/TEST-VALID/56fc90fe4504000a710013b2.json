    "description": "Given an integer <i>n</i> (n>=0 and n<=100) return the minimum number of guesses that it would take to find that number in a guessing game using an optimal solution. This is an example of the optimal guessing game solution in case you didn't know:<br>\n<br>\n  The answer is 42: <br>\n  Is the number 50? (min: 0, max: 100)    Answer: lower\n  \n  Is the number 25? (min: 0, max: 50)     Answer: higher\n  \n  Is the number 37? (min: 25, max: 50)    Answer: higher\n  \n  Is the number 43? (min: 37, max: 50)    Answer: lower\n  \n  Is the number 40? (min: 37, max: 43)    Answer: higher\n  \n  Is the number 41? (min: 40, max: 43)    Answer: higher\n\n  Is the number 42? (min: 41, max: 43)    Answer: Yes!\n  \n  The total # of guesses in this case is 7, so that is what you will return. Note to round down.\n  \n  Good luck!",
