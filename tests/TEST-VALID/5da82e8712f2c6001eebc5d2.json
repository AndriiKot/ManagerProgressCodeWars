    "description": "You need to get to the nth stair, the challenge is to get the number of different ways you can get to the nth stair with taking 1,2 or 3 steps at a time. \n\nSo for exmaple how many ways to get to the 3rd step. You can get there 4 was as shown here:\n[1,1,1]\n[1,2]\n[2,1]\n[3]\n\nWrite the method findCombs that finds all the different combinations of ways you can reach the nth step!",
