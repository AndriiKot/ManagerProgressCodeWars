    "description": "Betting accumulators allow you to place one stake (initial amount of money) against several different events, with the winnings of each being put against the next in a waterfall effect. Effectively you're betting that you can guess the correct results of many things at once, and any 1 of your choices being wrong will result in no winnings for you.\n\nYou will need to create a function, accumulator, to calculate the returns on a given accumulator bet with a given stake. You should allow for accumulators of any length - this bookmaker loves the high risk lifestyle. You should also be able to accept odds in string format (as over/under e.g., '2/1') or decimal (e.g., 2).\n\nFor example - I want to place a £2.00 bet on 3 horses with odds of 2/1, 3/1, and 4/1. If I place each bet individually, I spend £6.00 (£2 per bet) with potential returns of:\n\n```\n£2 @ 2/1 = £6 \n£2 @ 3/1 = £8 \n£2 @ 4/1 = £10 \nTotal = £24 (profit of £18)\n```\n\nHowever with an accumulator, I place just a single bet at £2! Lower initial cost, for the risk that any 1 of my horses losing I will receive £0. For the sake of this kata, we are all winners. So this breaks down as such:\n\n```\n£2 @ 2/1 = £6 -> @ 3/1 = £24 -> @ 4/1 = £120\nTotal = £120 (profit of £118)\n```\n\nThe first winnings seed the second winnings, which seed the third, and so on, leading to much larger winnings.\n\n```javascript\naccumulator(4.7, ['7/2','20/7','15/20'])\n```\n\nThe above is placing a 4.7 initial stake on to 3 selections at 7/2, 20/7 and 15/20.\n\nThe returns will need to be in decimal, to 2 decimal places.\n\nSomething to keep in mind - you will always get your stake back if you win, so a £2 bet at 2/1 returns £6.
