    "description": "## Task\n\nFind the n-th fibonacci number. \n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this Kata is to teach some very basic dynamic programming techniques with the sliding window trick. You do not need to know about these specifically to be able to solve this problem. The point is to give an intuitive understanding of dynamic programming.\n\n## Details\n\nThe fibonacci numbers are an integer sequence that is commonly found in nature. For the purpose of this Kata, do not consider negative integers n. If called on increasing integers starting with 0, the output should be `0,1,1,2,3,5,...`.\n\nFibonacci is typically implemented in three ways, all of which you will need to code.\n\n1. Naively, via the definition. The definition of fibonacci is `f_n = f_n-1 + f_n-2`\n\n2. Recursively. This should be similar to the naive solution, except it should run in linear (O(n)) time.\n\n3. Iteratively. This should be similar in runtime to the recursive solution, but it should only call the method once.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThere should only be three functions in your solution. If there are any more functions, then it will fail the tests. The fibit function should never call any functions, and the two other functions must have the correct calls as specified per the above details. Also, hardcoding various fibonacci values will not be accepted past the base case of `fib(0) = 0` and `fib(1) == 1`.",
