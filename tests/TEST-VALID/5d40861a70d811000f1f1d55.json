    "description": "Shall we play a game?\n```powershell\n>\n```\n\nHow about Rock Paper Scissors?\n```powershell\n>\n```\n\nGood!  I know exactly what I'm going to throw every turn!  \nCan you win a perfect round of 20 throws by round 40?\n\nMy throws are random but I'll give you some time to figure it out.  I'll even tell you how many throws you got right the previous round!  Helpful as always I am!  I even gave you a template to keep track of your wins.\n\nYou just need to guess what I am throwing by returning your guess to me in an int[] array.\n\n\n```csharp\n\n//The Rules\n\nRock = 0;\nPaper = 1;\nScissors = 2;\n? = 3;\n...\n\nMyPossibleMoves = possibleMoves;\nThrowsPerRound = roundLength;\nRounds = ?;\n\n```\n\nGood Luck!",
