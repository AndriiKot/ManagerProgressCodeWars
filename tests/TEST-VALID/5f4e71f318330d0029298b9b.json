    "description": "**Story**\n\nYou and a friend have been locked up and are awaiting your imminent excecution for not writing any comments in your code or some other similarly grievous crime. However the warden is a bit eccentric and he says that he will let you go if you can redeem yourselves by solving his puzzle.\nThe puzzle involves one person going into a room which has a chess board in it, as well as the warden. The chess board has a coin on every square, either heads or tails, the warden then places a small key in a recess under a coin. The person then has to flip one coin, after this they are taken to another room.\nThe second person is then brought into the room, if he can find the key you will both be set free. However he only knows the state chessboard and no other information.\n\n**Requirements**\n\nFor this kata you will need to write a function coin_finder, which takes as input a list with the board state and the key position and returns position of the coin to flip to encode the key placement.\nThe other function you will need to write is key_finder, which takes an encoded board state and returns the key placement.\n\n\n\n**Notes**\n\nthe warden's chessboard may not be 8x8 but it will always have a size 2^n, an example of the input for a 2x2 board would be ```['heads', 'tails', 'tails', 'heads'].```\n\nI was inspired to make this kata by [What's Your Poison?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58c47a95e4eb57a5b9000094) but the method used for that kata will not work for this one\n",
