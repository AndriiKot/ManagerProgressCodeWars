    "description": "You are a new code warrior who have recently stumbled on a website called Codewars and started using it, and quickly you are deeply annoyed that Codewars puts an arbitrary 12 seconds limit on all solutions. A valid solution being rejected due to inefficiency is annoying, right?\n\nBut little does it know that you are the number one contrarian in the world, who takes the pleasure to oppose every single possible rule! Screw efficiency, slow code for the win! From now on, every solution of yours shall be as slow as permitted by Codewars platform.\n\nYou shall write a function `antiOptimize` that receives a function `task` as its argument, and wraps it such that it returns the return value of the solution `task` **at least 11 seconds after `antiOptimize` is called**. `task` is an arbitrary function that might run for any duration between 0 to 10 seconds.\n\n\n\np.s Codewars has a startup overhead which is counted into the 12 seconds limit. For JavaScript this is around 300ms.",
