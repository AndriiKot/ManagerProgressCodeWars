    "description": "Wee Johnnie Rocker was adding a bit of jazz to his website and decided to start adding some CSS classes to his text. Being the alternative type he wanted to apply his class to the n'th character of each word(punctuation is included as a char) in a given string. \n\nHe did this by adding some 'css' and some 'html' code \n\nCSS & HTML code: \n\ncss:  `<style>.rocker { color: green; font-size: 2em } </style>`\n\nhtml: `<span class=\"rocker\"></span>` \n\n\n\n",
