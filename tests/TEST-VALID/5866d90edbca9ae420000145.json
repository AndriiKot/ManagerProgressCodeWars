    "description": "**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students**\n\nAll Star Code Challenge #26\n\nAll of Raj's once loner friends are now happily in a relationship. Even Sheldon!   \nRaj has hired you to manually change his group status to \"In a relationship,\" so he can show it to his friends!  \nCreate a function called missionImpossible() that takes a Group object as input that changes the \"Raj\" key, if it exists, to \"In a relationship\". The, now altered, object should be returned.\n\n```javascript\nvar wholeGroup = { Leonard: 'Married',\n  Penny: 'Married',\n  Howard: 'Married',\n  Bernadette: 'Married',\n  Sheldon: 'In a relationship',\n  Amy: 'In a relationship',\n  Raj: 'Single' }\nmissionImpossible(wholeGroup);\n// =>\n// { Leonard: 'Married',\n//  Penny: 'Married',\n//  Howard: 'Married',\n//  Bernadette: 'Married',\n//  Sheldon: 'In a relationship',\n//  Amy: 'In a relationship',\n//  Raj: 'In a relationship' }\n```\n\nNote:\nIf Raj is not part of the input group, he should NOT be added to it.",
