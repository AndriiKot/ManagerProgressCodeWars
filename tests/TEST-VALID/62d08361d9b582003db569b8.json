    "description": "# The Dutch National Flag Problem\n\nThere is a row of balls, each ball is either red, white, or blue.\n\nYour task is to rearrange (if necessary) the balls in the order of the Dutch national flag, i.e. first the red, then the white, and finally the blue balls.\n\nYou will receive a list of integer representing the row of balls and their colors:\n- 0 for red\n- 1 for white\n- 2 for blue\n\n## Examples (input -> output)\n\n```\n[1,2,0] -> [0,1,2]\n[1,2,1,0] -> [0,1,1,2]\n[1,2,2,0,2,1,1,0] -> [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2]\n```\n\nGive it a shot without using buit in sorting functions :)\n\nProposed by [Edsger Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_Dijkstra) in his book [_A Discipline of Programming_](https://seriouscomputerist.atariverse.com/media/pdf/book/Discipline%20of%20Programming.pdf#page=126) Prentice-Hall, 1976",
