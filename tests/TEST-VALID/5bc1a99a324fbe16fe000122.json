    "description": "The Maasai speak a very peculiar language. The general rules are: \n```Pearl\n-There has to be a vowel after every consonant, but there can be any letter after any vowel. Vowels are any of \"aeiou\".\n-The only exception is the consonant \"n\"; after this letter, there can be any letter (not only a vowel) or there can be no letter at all.\n```\nYour task is to write a method that recognizes a Massai word. Words will lower case only.\n\n```Haskell\nFor example:\nsolve(\"maasai\") = true \nsolve(\"codewars\") = false, because there has to be a vowel after every consonant.\nsolve(\"ab\") = false, because there has to be a vowel after every consonant.\nsolve(\"a\") = true, because there can be any letter after a vowel, but it's not a must.\n```\n\nMore examples in test cases.\n \nGood luck!\n",
