    "description": "You are provided an input string which was generated on a device where them mathematical operation keys are not usable and had to be replaced with the dsma keys. \n\nYou are required to write a function which can parse that so generated string as input and performs the corresponding mathematical operations (d = /, a = +, m = *, s = -) :\n\n`d (e.g: 7d4 = 1.75)`\n\n`s (e.g: 4s2 = 2)`\n\n`m (e.g: 5m5 = 25)`\n\n`a (e.g: 16a3 = 19)`\n\n\nThe calculator function needs to handle both decimal or integer results (decimals need to be rounded up to **3 decimal points**). Any other non-relevant characters or whitespace should be **ignored.** (this includes dsma not inbetween numbers).\n\n`Any leading zeroes of a number in the math operation are to be ignored/removed `\nand division by zero number sequences in the operation, are to return \"NaN\".\n\n*Example usage1: stringCalc(\"473d3\") should output 157.666*\n\n*Example usage2: stringCalc(\"5 m 5 \") should output 25*\n\n*Example usage3: stringCalc(\"5umu5\") should output 25*\n\nThe calculator needs to also be able to handle **division, multiplication** cases where math operations are **inconsistent or non-existent** as such:\n\n*Examples1: *\n\n*\"md\" or \"dm\" changes to \"d\"*\n\n*\"dd\"         changes to \"d\"*\n\n*\"sd\"         changes to \"d\" (\"ds\" stays as-is)*\n            \n*\"ad\"         changes to \"d\" (\"da\" stays as-is)*\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n*Example2: When there are no mathematical operators avail, only give the numbers in sequence.*\n\nNote :\n\n- there are cases with multiple operations\n- return \"NaN\" instead of NaN or Infinity",
