    "description": "\n## Description\nIn the age of big sailing, sea trade means wealth and adventure. If you have a ship that can sail in the sea and enough capital, you can begin your journey of wealth.\n\nFirst select a destination. Then buy a large number of cheap goods locally, transported to the destination to sell, to obtain the maximum profits. Of course, as a businessman, returning with an empty ship is unforgivable. You must buy cheap goods at destination and spend all your money. Bring back the goods and sell them for the maximum profit.\n\nThis is the sea trade. What is the most important? First of all, you need to have enough `capital`:\n\n```\ncapital=5000\n```\nOK, You have $5000. What is the second important? That is the `information`, you need to know what goods are shipped to the destination to get the maximum profit, and also need to know which goods are shipped back from the destination to get the maximum profit. \n\n```\n//information1 is the local product information\ninformation1=[\n{name:\"Leather\",price:2,quantity:2000},\n{name:\"Wine\",price:0.5,quantity:6000},\n{name:\"Spice\",price:20,quantity:300},\n{name:\"Silk\",price:15,quantity:1000}\n]\n\n//information2 is the destination product information\ninformation2=[\n{name:\"Leather\",price:6,quantity:200},\n{name:\"Wine\",price:5,quantity:1000},\n{name:\"Spice\",price:5,quantity:5000},\n{name:\"Silk\",price:4,quantity:5000}\n]\n\n```\nWe choose our goods according to the information:\n\n```\nIn the local, buy:\n\nWine (0.5) x 6000 = $3000\nLeather(2) x 1000 = $2000\n\nTransported to the destination, sold:\n\nWine (5)   x 6000 = $30000\nLeather(6) x 1000 = $6000\n\nYour $5000 became to $36000, nice profit ;-)\nAnd you're going to spend all that money.\n\nIn the destination, buy:\n\nSpice(5) x 5000 = $25000\nSilk (4) x 2750 = $11000\n\nTransported to the local, sold:\n\nSpice(20) x 5000 = $100000\nSilk (15) x 2750 = $41250\n\nIn the end, you get the profit:\n\n$141250 - $5000 = $136250\n```\n\n## Task\nComplete function `seaTrade` that accepts 3 arguments `capital` and `information1`, `information2`. Returns the final profit after your journey of wealth.\n\nNote: If there is not enough goods for you to buy, you can only buy the maximum amount you can get and don't buy the goods that no profit. For example, it is a foolish idea to buy Spices from local to destination.\n\nI'm not sure all random tests work properly, please help me to test it. Many thanks ;-)\n\n",
