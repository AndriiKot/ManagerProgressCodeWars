    "description": "# You have a store...\n...and you need a way to get the tax of an item (obviously), so, you create a JavaScript function\nthat will do it for you! You also need to total the costs to get the final price.\n\nYou are given two paramaters. The first parameter, `tax`, is the tax percentage. The second paramater, `subtotal` is the price before taxes are added. You also need to add a dollar sign ($) before your output, and you need to round the total to two decimal points.  So, if say the output is `\"$2\"` it should be `\"$2.50\"`.\n\n### Example:\n\nInput: `getPrice(13, 50)` <br>\nOutput: `\"$56.50\"`\n\n\n_This is my first kata, so please report any issues/suggestions._",
