    "description": "Welcome, Agent #139801. You have been hired as a secret agent on a top secret mission for a very secretive agency. We have been intercepting our enemy's messages, and their subject matter is of no relevance to you... HOWEVER, the messages come over using some strange and unsophisticated ciphering. We're a bit underfunded, though, so we can't afford any sophisticated deciphering technology.\n\nThat's where you come in. Your job is to analyze the incoming messages and determine the conversion rules used in the messages, then write a program to decode them. We have determined that not all of the same rules are used in every message, but each rule should have an ID associated with it. We were able to intercept the IDs as well, so we'll send that to you along with the original messages. Your decoder should only decode the rules with the IDs specified for that particular message. The IDs are listed in the order they were used for encoding. Those hooligans may even apply some rules more than once to a single message!\n\nGood luck, Agent #139801!\n\n<b>HINT:</b>\nThe example test cases will show you the rule IDs for each message. Look for correlations between the expected string and the IDs in the test cases to narrow down what rules do what. It is entirely possible to solve the kata using the provided example test cases. Press submit once you have programmed a decoding mechanism for all rules! (Submission test cases are not intended to give you the expected text or the rule ids; only the encoded input and the text your decoder would output.)",
