    "description": "Deadnauts are cruising in the spaceship lost in the universe.\n\nYour task is to find them.\n\nImplement a Simulator object that will be initialized with information about the ship - it's mass and it's initial velocity.\n\nShips get caught in gravity wells etc. and their course may be changed. Therefore, simulator may be additionaly initialized with array of events - every event consists of a beginning time, duration and force vector (the force is applied to the ship for given duration since begin time).\n\nEvents cannot overlap other events in time.\n\nAssume the ship always starts at point (0,0,0);\n\nThe Simulator.findThem function should take time as an argument and return position of the ship in given time.\n\nThese are some basic formulas to get you started:\n```\nvelocity = distance/time\nacceleration = velocity/time\nacceleration = force/mass\n```\n\nAbove formulas work for instantaneous vectors.\n\nPlease ignore relativistic effects.\n\nAll input will be valid (no negative masses etc.).\n\nReference on dynamics: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion",
