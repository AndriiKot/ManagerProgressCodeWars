    "description": "# Point in a Polygon with curves\nGiven a 2d polygon description and a point coordinate, determine whether the point exists inside or outside the polygon.\n\nThe polygon may be simple or complex, and can include curves. The polygon description must be for a closed polygon, in which the first and last point\ndescribed are the same.\n\nThe polygon description will use three operators: moveto, lineto, and curveto, similar to a subset of Postscript path operators.\n\n'moveto' sets the current x y point\n\n'lineto' draws a boundary to the next x y point, which becomes the new current x y point\n\n'curveto' draws a Bezier cubic spline, starting at the current x y point, and ending at the fourth (third supplied) point\n\nA typical polygon descriptor\n```javascript\n  var thisPolygon = {'polygon' : [\n\t\t{'moveto' : {'x' : 10, 'y' : 10}},\n\t\t{'lineto' : {'x' : 20, 'y' : 10}},\n\t\t{'curveto' : [{'x' : 25, 'y' : 12}, {'x' : 25, 'y' : 18}, {'x' : 20, 'y' : 20}]},\n\t\t{'lineto' : {'x' : 10, 'y' : 20}},\n\t\t{'lineto' : {'x' : 10, 'y' : 10}}\n\t]}; ```\n\nA typical point descriptor\n```javascript\n\tvar thisPoint = {'x' : 12, 'y' : 18}; ```\n\nA good starting point for the point in polygon algorithm test can be found here: http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/wrf/Research/Short_Notes/pnpoly.html\nThere are other examples as well. It will require that any curves be rendered into straight-line segments.\n\nGiven a polygon and a point, the pointInPoly function will return true if the point is in side the polygon, false if it is outside, or a string: 'Error!'\nif the polygon is not closed properly. (This last because the Test.expectError() call does not seem to handle errors as stated.)\n\n# About Bezier splines\n\nFrom the Adobe Postscript Reference Manual:\n\n<div style=\"padding: 12px; background-color: #666;\">\n\nMathematically, a cubic Bézier curve is derived from a pair of parametric cubic equations:\n\n<div style=\"padding-left: 12px\">x(t) = a<sub>x</sub>t<sup>3</sup> + b<sub>x</sub>t<sup>2</sup> + c<sub>x</sub>t + x<sub>0</sub></div>\n\n<div style=\"padding-left: 12px\">y(t) = a<sub>y</sub>t<sup>3</sup> + b<sub>y</sub>t<sup>2</sup> + c<sub>y</sub>t + y<sub>0</sub></div>\n\nThe cubic section produced by curveto is the path traced by x(t) and y(t) as t ranges from 0 to 1.\n</div>\n\nBut don't panic, there is an easier way.\n\nThe Bezier cubic spline consists of two end points and two control points:\n\n<img src=\"http://www.e-cartouche.ch/content_reg/cartouche/graphics/en/image/curves/cub_bez_curve.jpg\">\n\nSource http://wikipedia.com\n\nTo plot the midpoint of the curve, find the midpoints of the three vectors between the four points (P01, P12, P23). Find the midpoints between\nthose three points (P012, P123). Find the final midpoint between those two points (P0123).\n\n<img src=\"http://www.deluge.co/sites/deluge.co/files/benzier.gif\">\n\nSource: http://www.deluge.co\n\nThis may seem unnecessarily complicated, but since a lot of the calculation is simply dividing by two, it can be done very quickly with binary\nbit shift operations. This meant a lot in 1984, as PostScript was heading to market in early laser printers. Complex curves could be described and\nplotted with minimal computation.\n\nNotice that the two remaining point sets (P0, P01, P012 and P0123) and (P0123, P123, P23 and P3) describe the next two Bezier curves down. One can\nrecurse this function to the precision needed, and return all the points to form the straight-line segments for the polygon.\n\nAnother way to do this is to plot a percentage of each midpoint, and range across them to the end: 10% of the distance from each point and midpoint to the next,\n20%, 30%, etc. will product 10 line segments whose endpoints are on the described curve. Adjust your precision as necessary.\n\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Bezier_3_big.png/240px-Bezier_3_big.png\"> <img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Bezier_3_big.gif/240px-Bezier_3_big.gif\">\n\nSource: https://github.com/mammenx/synesthesia_zen/wiki/Curve-Surfing",
