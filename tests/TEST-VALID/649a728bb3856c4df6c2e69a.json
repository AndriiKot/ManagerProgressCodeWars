    "description": "Your maths teacher decided to give you a challenging problem which requires strong mental maths skills. Luckily, you have secretly brought your laptop with you to find the answer using Python! The question is as follows:\n\n\nGiven the first two terms of the fibonacci sequence m and n, he asks you to check whether positive integer k in the sequence and return its position in the sequence. Create a function called ```fib()``` with parameters ```m``` (first positive integer), ```n``` (second positive integer), and ```k``` (target number).\n\n\nAdditional messages: m and n are different positive integers.\n\n\n\nIf integer k is in the sequence, return it's position in the form of an integer. It k is not in the sequence, ```return None```.\n\n\n```\nExample: fib(1,1,34) would return 9 since 35 is the 9th fibonacci number in this sequence.\n\nfib(1,1,4) would return None because 4 is not in the sequence.\n\nFibonacci sequence starting with 1,1:\n1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n```Good Luck!```",
