Since it can be a pain to convert meters to light-years in your head, you need to write a function to do that. Note: The goal is not to perform the division(that would be too easy), it's to figure out the conversion factor or somehow hack the `ly` function.\n\n```python\ndef light_year(meters):\n\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst lightYear = meters =>\n```",
