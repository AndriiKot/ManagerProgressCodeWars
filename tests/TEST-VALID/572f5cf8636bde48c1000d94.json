Now he have a chance to escape this gloomy place.\n\n###Goal\nYour goal is to escape the Arkhil's castle.\n\n###Input\nYou have a function called 'Move'. it takes 4 parameters:\n\n1. ```map``` - map of current level represented as 2 dimensional array filled with ```true``` - empty cell and ```false``` - wall\n2. ```playerPosition``` - current player position\n3. ```exitPosition``` - position of the exit. You need to reach it\n4. ```enemies``` - enimies is an array filled with objects(enemies) that have next fields:\n```\nposition - object with fileds 'x' and 'y'\nlastPosition - object with fileds 'x' and 'y'\ndirection - Enemie's movement direction. It can have 4 states:\n  0 - UP\n  1 - RIGHT\n  2 - DOWN\n  3 - LEFT\n```\n\n###Output\nWhen you function calculated all thing that it needs, it can make decision where player need to move.\nFunction need return movement direction as Object with fileds ```x``` and ```y```.\n\n###Preloaded\nTo draw map you can use function ```printMap( map, playerPosition, exitPosition, enemies )```\n\nPreloaded movement\n```javascript\nSTAY       = { x:  0, y:  0 }\nMOVE_UP    = { x:  0, y: -1 }\nMOVE_DOWN  = { x:  0, y:  1 }\nMOVE_LEFT  = { x: -1, y:  0 }\nMOVE_RIGHT = { x:  1, y:  0 }\n```\n\nIf you need to compare positions you can use preloaded function called ```comparePositions```. It will return ```true``` if positions are equal otherwise it will return ```false```\n\nTo work with positions you can use 2 preloaded functions. ```sumPositions( pos1, pos2 )``` and ```subPositions( pos1, pos2 )```\n\n### Preconditions\n```map``` always have borders\n\n```exit``` it always reachable",
