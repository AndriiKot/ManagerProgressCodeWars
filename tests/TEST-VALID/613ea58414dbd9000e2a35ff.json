You're given a height of the pine you will be growing. But you already have top and bottom, so you need to care only about its branches.\n\n- The pine always starts with ```^```, it's its top.\n- The pine core is its branches. (minimum given height is 3)\n- The pine always ends with ```| |```, it's its bottom.\n\nThe pine image should have spaces only in the biginning of lines as in the example above.\nTop and bottom of the pine counts as height too.\n\n***This could be duplicate of https://www.codewars.com/kata/577c349edf78c178a1000108****",
