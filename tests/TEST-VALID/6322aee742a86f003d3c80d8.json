    "description": "A [Bipartite Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets *U* and *V* such that every edge connects a vertex in *U* to one in *V*.\n\n![Example Bipartite Graph](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Simple_bipartite_graph%3B_two_layers.svg/2880px-Simple_bipartite_graph%3B_two_layers.svg.png)\nThis graph is bipartite because the numbered vertices and the lettered vertices can each be put into their own set such that there are no edges internal to either set.\n\n![Example not Bipartite Graph](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Complete_graph_K3.svg/1920px-Complete_graph_K3.svg.png)\nThis graph is not bipartite, because no matter which way you split up the 3 vertices into two groups, there will always be at least one edge within a group.\n\nYou are given an undirected graph passed as a list of edges like so:\n```python\n[\n  (1, 2),\n  (2, 3),\n  (3, 1)\n]\n```\nEach edge is a 2-tuple of integers with each element being the ID of a node at one end of the edge. Given this graph, write a method that returns `True` if the graph is bipartite and `False` if it is not.\n\nNotes:\n* The partitioning of a bipartite graph into two distinct sets is not necessarily unique.\n* You may assume that the vertices of the graph are exactly the numbers that appear in at least one edge.\n* The same edge may or may not appear more than once.\n* The edges `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)` are the same edge. The list of edges might have one or both.\n* It is possible for an edge to connect a node to itself.\n* The graph is not necessarily a single connected component.",
