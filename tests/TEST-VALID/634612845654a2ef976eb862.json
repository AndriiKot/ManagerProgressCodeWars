    "description": "Witches will turn on their colleagues when they don't have anyone to pick on.  If the witches outnumber the goblins and spiders, they will prevail.  However if the goblins put the spiders on their head, they turn into horrific looking Spidy-Gobs and multiply their powers by 8, which makes them equivalent to 8 regular Goblins(the spiders are not counted in this situation).  In order to turn into a Spidy-Gob, there needs to be a minimum of 8 spiders  \n\nYour job is to prepare the spiders and goblins to have an optimal chance against the witches (i.e create the largest count of Spidy-Gobs or (Goblins and Spiders), if they are equal no need to create Spidy-Gobs).\n\nWe don't care about the number of witches, we want the most powerful army to prepare for them broom-riding, toad sacrificing, wackos\n\nArguments are passed in as (goblins: int, spiders: int)",
