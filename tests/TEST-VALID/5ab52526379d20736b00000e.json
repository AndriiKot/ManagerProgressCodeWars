    "description": "In this kata you have to write a function that determine the number of magazines that every soldier has to have in his bag.\n \nYou will receive the weapon and the number of streets that they have to cross.\nConsidering that every street the soldier shoots 3 times. Bellow there is the relation of weapons:\n\n\nPT92 - 17 bullets </br>\nM4A1 - 30 bullets </br>\nM16A2 - 30 bullets </br>\nPSG1 - 5 bullets </br>\n\nExample:\n\n[\"PT92\", 6] => 2 (6 streets 3 bullets each) </br>\n[\"M4A1\", 6] => 1\n\nThe return Will always be an integer so as the params.\n\n~~~if:fortran\n*NOTE: In Fortran the weapon and number of streets are passed in as two separater arguments (the first one a string, the second an integer) instead of a single array.*\n~~~\n\n~~~if:c\n*NOTE: In C the weapon and number of streets are passed in as two separate arguments (the first one a string, the second an integer) instead of a single array.*\n~~~",
