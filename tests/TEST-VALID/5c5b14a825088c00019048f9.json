    "description": "Imagine that you are a chemists and you prepare serial dilution of some substance solution, with known concetration (stock). \n\nYou dilute this substance to prepare series and on each step you dilute solution two times. \n\nFunctions should return a list of concentrations of this dilutions series (concentrations are floats). \n\n- series is always positive integer number\n- stock is always positive number\n- if stock is 0.0 it should return series of 0.0\n- if series is 0 functions should return empty list\n",
