    "description": "Hannah has set an alarm, but keeps hitting the snooze button.\n\nToday she set the alarm for 6am. And every time she hits the snooze button, the alarm is set to go off again 7 minutes later. So if she hits the snooze button twice, the alarm will go off at 6am, 6:07am and 6:14am.\n\nYour job is to write a generic getAlarmTimes function that will return an array listing all the times Hannah's alarm will go off on a given day, based on how long her snooze button is set to last for, and how many times she pushes it.\n\nThe function should take the parameters: startTime (the initial time she sets the alarm for), numberOfSnoozes (the number of times she hits the snooze button), and snoozeDuration (how long until the alarm goes off again).\n\nIt should return an array of strings listing the time stamps in 24 hour time, in the format \"6:07\" (4:07pm would be \"16:07\").\n\neg.\ngetAlarmTimes(\"6:00\", 3, 7);\n\nThe output is:\n[\"6:00\", \"6:07\", \"6:14\", \"6:21\"]\n\nThe startTime will always be given in 24 hour time, as a string in the described format. numberOfSnoozes and snoozeDuration will always be positive integers.",
