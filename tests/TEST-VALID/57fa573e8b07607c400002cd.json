    "description": "One of the simplest forms of encoding data is to perform a simple XOR encoding.  This takes the input and XORs it with a pass phrase to produce an encoded message.  The encoding is reversable by performing the same XOR operation against the encoded message.  This means that encoding isn't particularly secure, however it is sufficient to withstand a passing glance.\n\nThe purpose of this Kata is to complete the two provided classes so that a message can be encrypted and decrypted using XOR encryption.  The `MessageEncryptor` is responsible for translating `String`s to `byte`s for encryption and back again.  The `XOREncoder` is responsible for the actual encoding.  The provided `TestCases` should lead you to a solution.\n",
