    "description": "In this Kata, you will learn how to set a new user into a Database, then evolving and clearing with given Predicates required to do so.\n\nFirst off, you will create a Database, either with `class Database {}` or the pre-given `function Database() {}`; Whichever one you feel most comfortable with.\n\nIt should hold a property called `users`, which will be an instance of `Map`\n\nA `create(id)` method should push a user into the Map with the given ID. If there is no given ID, it should be the user size + 1\n\n* If the given ID already exists in the Database, it should throw a new `Error` instance, of any kind.\n* When called on, a new user should hold properties `age`, `veteran`. Respectively, their default values should be `0` and `false`.\n\nAn `evolve(fn)` method, when called, users in the `Map` should be checked to see if they meet the filter predicate given.\n\n* If they pass, their age should be incremented by 1.\n* When they evolve, if their age is at least `10`, their own Veteran status should become `true`.\n* Any time the `fn` argument is not passed, its default should evolve all.\n\nFinally, there should be a `clear(fn)` method. All users that pass the given filter should be deleted from the database.\n\n* If they pass, they should be deleted from the database.\n* Any time the `fn` argument is not passed, its default should delete all.\n\nPredicate Arguments:\n* `info` - The user's value in `users`.\n  * Example: `{ age: 9, veteran: false }`\n* `id` - The user's ID in `users`.\n  * Example: `2`\n* `index` - The zero-based index of the current iteration.\n  * Example: `1`\n\n**Extra Information**\n  * `create(id)` - The input will always be a string\n  * `evolve(fn)` & `clear(fn)` - The input will always be a function",
