    "description": "The oldest farmers found that only rain can increase the yield of strawberries. Help them prepare for the harvest and forecast how many kilos of strawberries will be to harvest.\n\nYour task\n\nKnowing that farmers have historical data of rainfalls (eg. [134,12,13,134,142,1435,132]) and data of strawberries quantity they harvested (eg. [50,7,14,41,23,121,12]) try to discover how one entity of rainfall impacts on strawberries quantity. For example 1 entity of rainfall increases quantity of strawberries to be harvested by 0.07 units.\n\nAll numbers are strictly positive. Round down the outcome to two decimals.\nIf observetions are inconsistent (different number of rainfalls and strawberries quantity) please return \"Invalid input data\".\n\nHint: Simple statistical method is valid for this task.\n\n",
