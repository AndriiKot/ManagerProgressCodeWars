    "description": "You are a newly hired tech employee and are tasked with filtering through a list of customer comments and ranking them from most positive to least positive, in order to allow the company to better target and track their relationships with customers.  \n\nThe criteria you've been given is to use the following words to develop your ranks:\n\nPositive words: [\"great\", \"amazing\", \"good\", \"happy\", \"wonderful\", \"phenomenal\", \"super\", \"superb\", \"helpful\"]\n\nNegative words: [\"awful\", \"sad\", \"bad\", \"rough\", \"terrible\", \"mean\", \"rude\", \"unhelpful\"]\n\nEach comment should be evaluated based on how many positive/negative words are included, with equal weight given to each word.  (e.g., a review of \"Annie was great, but James was rude\" would be given a neutral rating as one positive word negated the one negative word.)\n\nYour function should return a string of customers ranked from happiest to least happy, seperated by commas.",
