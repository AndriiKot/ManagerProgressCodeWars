    "description": "Given an array of 3 or more integers, where all but one integer are either even or odd, return the integer that is not like the others.\n\nFor example:  \n  - `findOutlier([2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36])`  \n    Should return: `11`\n\nWhile:  \n  - `findOutlier([160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21])`  \n    Should return: `160`\n\nIf you get an error, like:  \n```\nThe server timed out waiting for the code to finish executing. \nIt is possible that this is due to high server load. It may also \nbe caused by inefficent code. Please try your request again.\n```  \n_OR_  \n```\nProcess was terminated. It took longer than 12000ms to complete\n```  \n\n_Then you need to find a more efficient algorithm!_ \n  \n  \n---\n  \n  \nThis specific kata is based largely on [obnounce](https://www.codewars.com/users/obnounce)'s \"[Find The Parity Outlier](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-parity-outlier/)\", but requires at least a little bit of optimization.\n\nThanks to [yumaikas](https://www.codewars.com/users/yumaikas)' \"[Multiples of 3 and 5 redux](https://www.codewars.com/kata/multiples-of-3-and-5-redux)\" for the performance inspiration!\n\nThanks to [Benjamin Kästner](https://www.codewars.com/users/bkaes) for \"[The conjured Codewars codex](http://bkaestner.github.io/codewars-rules/#always-test-all-corner-cases-of-your-input-domain)\".
