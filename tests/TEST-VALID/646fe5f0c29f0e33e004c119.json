    "description": "John likes to go down stairs to do what he wants every night.\n\nThere is one problem though, John doesn't want to wake his dad up, Luckily John knows exactly how loud what he is going to do is, (this will be arr, an array of numbers that represents the volume of what John is going to do), and how loud his dad is (m).\n\nYour task is given arr and m, find out if his John can do what he wants without waking his dad up. If he can (he is quiet enough) return true, other wise return false.\n\nthe numbers will represent the volume in decibals.\nRemeber that for every ten decibals it gets ten times louder.\nso 60DB = 50DB * 10, which means ([50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50],60) would return true\nand ([50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50],60) would return false\n",
