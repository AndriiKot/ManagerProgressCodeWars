    "description": "<font color=\"red\">Alice</font> and <font color=\"yellow\">Bob</font> need to send secret messages to each other and are discussing ways to encode their messages:\n\n> <font color=\"red\">Alice</font>: “Let’s just use a very simple code: We’ll assign ‘A’ the code word 1, ‘B’ will be 2, and so on down to ‘Z’ being assigned 26.”\n\n> <font color=\"yellow\">Bob</font>: “That’s a stupid code, Alice. Suppose I send you the word ‘BEAN’ encoded as 25114. You could decode that in many different ways!”\n\n> <font color=\"red\">Alice</font>: “Sure you could, but what words would you get? Other than `BEAN`, you’d get `BEAAD`, `YAAD`, `YAN`, `YKD` and `BEKD`. I think you would be able to figure out the correct decoding. And why would you send me the word `BEAN` anyway?”\n\n> <font color=\"yellow\">Bob</font>: “OK, maybe that’s a bad example, but I bet you that if you got a string of length 5000 there would be tons of different decodings and with that many you would find at least two different ones that would make sense.”\n\n> <font color=\"red\">Alice</font>: “How many different decodings?”\n\n> <font color=\"yellow\">Bob</font>: “Jillions!”\n\nFor some reason, <font color=\"red\">Alice</font> is still unconvinced by <font color=\"yellow\">Bob’s</font> argument, so she requires a program that will determine how many decodings there can be for a given string using her code.",
