    "description": "Given multiple lists (name, age, height), each of size n :\n\nAn entry contains one name, one age and one height. The attributes corresponding to each entry are determined by the index of each list, for example entry 0 is made up of ```name[0], age[0], height[0]```.\n\nA duplicate entry is one in which the name, age and height are ALL the same.\n\nWrite a function ```count_duplicates(name,age,height)``` which takes in the attributes for each entry and returns an integer for the number of duplicated entries. For a set of duplicates, the original entry should not be counted as a duplicate.",
