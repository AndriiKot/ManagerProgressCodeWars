    "description": "I first started to think about this issue when I saw a MythBusters TV program where they managed to fold a paper in half 11 times. Current record is 12 times.<br>\nBut if we could have an infinite piece of paper and could fold it any time we want, what would be the thickness of all the layers?<br>\nLet's check it out!\n\nYour task is to write a function which gets 2 arguments: \"thickness\" in millimeters of 1 sheet of paper and \"n\" - number of folding times.<br>\nFunctions should return total thickness of all layers of paper when you fold it n times.<br>\nIf answer is less than 1 meter return it in millimeters, if it is less than kilometer return it in meters, or in km.\n\n0 < answer < 1'000   ---> answer + mm <br>\n1'000 ≤ answer < 1'000'000   ---> answer  + m <br>\nanswer ≥ 1'000'000 ---> answer + km <br>\n<strong>The answer should be formatted to correct units and then rounded exactly to 2 decimal places. Example: \"1.00 mm\", \"2.00 m\", \"1.00 km\"</strong>\n\nIf thickness of 1 sheet of paper a = 0.09 (mm)<br>\nwe are folding it in half b = 3 (times):\n\n1st time = 0.09 + 0.09 = 0.18 mm <br>\n2nd time = 0.18 + 0.18 = 0.36 mm <br>\n3rd time = 0.36 + 0.36 = 0.72 mm <br>\nso the result should be \"0.72 mm\" <br>\n\nIt is hard to believe but the thickness of paper folded in half 70 times will be more than 11 light years )) \n\nGood luck!\n",
