    "description": "<h2><font color=\"LightSeaGreen\">Kakurasu</font></h2>\nsometimes called Bokkusu is a Japanese logic puzzle with simple rules.<br>\n\nThe goal is to fill some of the cells with 'X' in such a way that:\n1. The 'X'-cells on each row sum up to the number on the right.\n2. The 'X'-cells on each column sum up to the number on the bottom.\n3. If a 'X'-cell is first on its row/column its value is 1. If it is second its value is 2 etc. \n\nFor more info, see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tYprDy6sAA\">tutorial video</a> or play it <a href=\"https://www.puzzle-kakurasu.com/\">online</a>.\n\n<h2><font color=\"LightSeaGreen\">Example</font></h2>\n\n            1     2     3     4    \n         +-----+-----+-----+-----+  \n       1 |     |     |  X  |  X  | 7\n         +-----+-----+-----+-----+\n       2 |  X  |  X  |     |  X  | 7\n         +-----+-----+-----+-----+\n       3 |     |  X  |     |  X  | 6\n         +-----+-----+-----+-----+\n       4 |     |  X  |  X  |     | 5\n         +-----+-----+-----+-----+\n            2     9     5     6    \n            \n<h2><font color=\"LightSeaGreen\">Task</font></h2>\n\nWrite a method that takes an array of values as an argument and returns the solution as a string. <br>\nThe first four values of the input array will be the target sums for each row, from top to bottom; the last four values will be the target sums for each column, from right to left. The size of the grid is 4x4 and the input array always consists of 8 valid numbers (from 1 to 10). In the example above, the order would be ```7, 7, 6, 5, 6, 5, 9, 2```. <br>\nThe result should return ```\"  XX\\nXX X\\n X X\\n XX \"```.\n\nGood Luck!\n\n",
