    "description": "Dave is obsessed with saving.  He likes to save time, space, money, everything.\n\nDave reckons that it is possible to take most of the vowels out of a sentence and still read what it says.  His experiments show that readablity is much better if the first and last letters of each word are retained - even if they are a vowel.\n\nYour challenge is to to write a function that extracts all the vowels from the inside of words in a sentence.  You should maintain punctuation and capitalisation and treat non A-Z characters as if they are a space.  You should also return the number of characters saved as a proportion of the original characters and as a % (rounded to a whole number).\n\nFor example, \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\" becomes:\n\"The qck brwn fx jmpd ovr the lzy dg. 9/45 20%\"",
