    "description": "Provide a color that equals every other color:\n```\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors:_A%E2%80%93F\n```\n\nThe test fixture I use for this kata is pre-populated.\n\nIt will compare the provided color with a random color generated using:\n```python\nrandom.choice(color_list)\n```\n\nIn order to pass, you require a color that can freely transform into every other color when needed. How does one make such a color? Now that is a good question, time to find out!\n\nThe key to success lies in understanding the hidden mechanisms that make a defeat device work.\n```\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeat_device\n```\n\nRiddle:\n\nA powerful tool lies hidden in the depths of the forest, waiting to be discovered. It has the power to alter the course of events, and can be used to craft the perfect ending. But beware, the path to harnessing this power is long and winding, and those who are ill-prepared may find themselves caught in a web of misdirection. To find the answer, one must take a closer look at the true nature of the unseen.\n",
