    "description": "# Story\nPeru-Peru has decided to move to a big city and needs an apartment.\n<br>But not simple, but corresponding to his desires.\n<br>Turning to the real estate service, he was provided with a database with offers.\n<br>Having received it, Peru-Peru turned to you for help.\n\n# Input data\n`dict, dict`\n> 1 - dictionary with wishes. `{item: set}`\n>- **key**: `str` requirement in wish, **value**: `set` set of desired intersections\n\n> 2 - dictionary, where the main key **key** is the address of the apartment, and the **value** is a nested dictionary. `{address: dict}`\n>- In the nested dictionary, a **key**: some item of description, and **value**: set with clause conditions. `{item: set}`\n>- **structure identical to wish dictionary**\n\n# Output\nThe task is to return a `list` of addresses of apartments *whose requirements have the most **intersections*** with the wishes of Peru-Peru: `['address', 'address', ...]`\n<br>*If no matching apartments can be found*, **return**: `'Not found!'`\n\n# Additional Information\n- The *wishes dictionary* is always full, as is each item in the nested dictionary of the database.\n- The apartment must meet at least **4 conditions**.\n- If several apartments have overcome the threshold of 4 matches, then only those apartments whose matches *have the largest number and are equal to each other* are subject to return. Peru-Peru will select a suitable apartment from your list independently.\n- The **Agreement** and **Local establishments** clauses do not require full compliance. That is, only the intersection with the desires of Peru-Peru is important.\n\nThe form for filling out an offer for an apartment looks like this:\n>**Address**:\n>- 221b Baker street\n\n>**Items**: \n>- Floor - 5\n>- Status - Requires repair\n>- Agreement - Jacuzzi, Home cinema\n>- Nearest stops - 7\n>- Subway accessibility - True\n>- Local establishments - Hospital, Club, Bar\n\n```python\ndatabase = {'221b Baker street':\n                {'Floor': {5},\n                 'Status': {'Repair required'},\n                 'Agreement': {'Jacuzzi', 'Home cinema'},\n                 'Nearest stops': {7},\n                 'Subway accessibility': {True},\n                 'Local establishments': {'Hospital', 'Club', 'Bar'}\n                 }\n            }\n```\n- **Again, the structure of the nested dictionary with items is identical to the wish dictionary**",
