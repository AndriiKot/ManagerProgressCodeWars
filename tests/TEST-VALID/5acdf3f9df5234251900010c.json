    "description": "dots and boxes is a game played by players taking turns to connect two dots, vertically or horizontally but not diagnolly. When all three lines of a box is linked , the player who \nconnects the final link and completes the box earns a point.\n\nAt the end when all dots have been connected, the player who completes most boxes wins the game. \n\nthe co-ordinates of the dots are given as:\n\n.(0,0)  .(0,1)  .(0,2)\n\n.(1,0)  .(1,1)  .(1,2)\n\n.(2,0)  .(2,1)  .(2,2)\n\n\nfor the 2 by 2 dots and boxes game :\n\n.    .    .\n\n.    .    .\n  \n.    .    .\n\nWrite a function for 2 by 2 box dots, where already connected links is supplied in argument as array of lines with two end-points co-ordinates. \n\nArray_of_lines = [line1, line2, line3,.....]\n\nwhere, \n\n  line = [one_end_point, another_end_point]\n\nand \n\n  end_point = [x, y]\n  \n\neg \n\n[ [ [0,0],[0,1] ], [ [0,1],[0,2] ], [ [1,1],[1,2] ], [ [1,1],[2,1] ], [ [1,2],[2,2] ] ]\n\nhas five lines already connected or linked where\n[ [0,0],[0,1] ] means the points (0,0) and (0,1) is already linked .\n\n\nThe function will check if there is any place where one line can be connected and box can be\ncompleted hence winning a point and so returns true on finding a first match, or if no match is found returns false.\n\n\n\n\n",
