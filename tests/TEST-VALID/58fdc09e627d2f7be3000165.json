    "description": "Pascal triangle / Yang Hui triangle is a rather familiar topic in various katas. \n\nHowever, in this kata, the problem is very simple (but an effecient solutio n is appreciated). \n\nImagine the triangle is a pine, and a value as a leaf. \n\nHere we call the summit as Line 0, and below is Line 1, etc. \nIn each line, there is Point 0, Point 1, ... etc. \nIn this way, the value in Line n and Point k should be \n<pre>\n  k\nC \n  n, \n</pre>\nor \n<pre>\n( n )\n( k ). \n</pre>\n\nIn the tree here, if the value of a point is odd, we see it as a green leaf; if even, a yellow one. A green leaf will have the colour code 1, and a yellow leave, 0. \n\nPlease judge the colour code of a leaf (n, k).\n\nExample: \n<pre>\ncolour_leaf(3, 2) = 1   # As C(3, 2) = 3, it is green, so return 1. \n</pre>\n\nIf possible, please refrain yourself from using large number operation in Python. \n\nDo you have a smart solution? For example, does an O(log n) algorithm exist?  [I can prove one. In C, the standard judgement is it. In Python, I had not proved it when I drafted the kata, so a slower but sure solution is there for random tests. ]\n\nIf you discover some patterns, can you prove them? [Of course, the kata judgement does not judge your mathematical proof. ]\n",
