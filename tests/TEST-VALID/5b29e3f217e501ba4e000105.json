    "description": "This kata is inspired by [Don't rely on luck HARDCORE](https://www.codewars.com/kata/dont-rely-on-luck-hardcore). You should be able to finish that kata before this.\n\n---\n\nThis time, you will provide your answer by calling `solve` with a number `solution`, your answer, like this:\n\n```javascript\nsolve(42 /* solution */);\n```\n\nAnd the answer you provided will be compared to a random number, like this (but not exactly in this way):\n\n```javascript\nsolution == Math.floor(Math.random() * 1e6);\n```\n\nThe test will be repeated multiple times, so that the probability of you passing by luck would not be much higher than cosmic ray flipping a bit in Codewars servers and letting you pass.\n\nYou will need to cheat the system again. However, this time the anti-cheating tests are EVEN HARDER. (At least I designed it to be.) See if you can still beat it.\n\n---\n\nA kind note from the author of the 'hardcore' version:\n\n> Also note that there are cheating methods that can solve all katas, but please do not use them, they will be detected by the Codewars system (by testing if tests that should fail actually pass) and you will lose your points. Please use a method that only works for this particular kata.\n\n---\n\nThanks so much to [tianshuo](https://www.codewars.com/users/tianshuo) for the original idea!\n\n",
