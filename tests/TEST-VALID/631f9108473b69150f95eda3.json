    "description": "In tennis, players get two chances (serves) to start the point, which they can later win or lose. If they miss their 1st serve, they get a 2nd serve. If they miss the 2nd serve, they lose the point. \n\nCommon stats for a player's serve are\n  - percentage of 1st serves in play\n  - percentage of 1st serve points won\n  - percentage of 2nd serves in play\n  - percentage of 2nd serve points won\n\nWrite a function that takes these four values as floating point numbers between 0 and 1, and returns the percentage of total points won on 1st and 2nd serves for this player. Format as a floating point number.",
