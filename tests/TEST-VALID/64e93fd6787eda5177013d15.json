    "description": "Pushing the wagon\n\nYou are a wagon pusher who need to load wagons on a rail with goods inside a warehouse.\nThe goods are placed in a straight line, and has specific weights.\nYou can only push one wagon at a time and must follow certain rules to complete the task.\n\nTask:\nWrite a function push_wagons(weights) that takes a list of wagon weights as input and returns the minimum number of wagons required to move all the goods from the starting point to the endpoint, while following these rules:\n\n1. You can only push wagons from the back of the line.\n2. You can only push a wagon if the sum of the weights of the wagons you've pushed so far is less than or equal    to the weight of the wagon you're about to push.\n3. If the sum of the weight is greater than the next, a new wagon needs to be used.\n\n\nInput:\nweights: A list of integers representing the weights of the goods in order from the starting point to the endpoint. Each weight is a positive integer.\n\nOutput:\nAn integer representing the minimum number of wagons required to move all the goods to the endpoint.\n\n",
