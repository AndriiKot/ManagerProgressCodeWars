    "description": "Using equations `scanl` can be defined as follows:\n\n```haskell\nrs !! 0     = s0\nrs !! (n+1) = rs !! n <+> xs !! n \n\n=>\n\nrs = scanl (<+>) s0 xs\n```\n\nWhat that means for us is that if we can express our problem in terms of those two equations we may as well rewrite it as `scanl`.\n\nHere is an example:\n```haskell\nfibs !! 0     = 0\nfibs !! 1     = 1\nfibs !! (n+1) = fibs !! n + fibs !! (n-1)\n\n  {- Substitution -}\nfibs = 0 : rs \nrs !! 0     = 1\nrs !! (n+1) = rs !! n + fibs !! n\n\n  {- Definition of scanl -}\nfibs = 0 : rs\nrs = scanl (+) 1 fibs\n\n  {- Substitution -}\nfibs = 0 : scanl (+) 1 fibs\n```\n\n<h3>Your task is to implement:</h3>\n\n1) The infinite series of the successive powers of two: \n\n`[1, 2, 4, 8, 16..]`\n\n2) Tribonacci numbers (similar to the Fibonacci numbers, but start with 3 predefined numbers): \n\n*Here you only need to use only one scanl. The second sum can be solved any other way*\n\n`[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13..]`\n\n3) [Pell numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell_number) (also similar to the Fibonacci numbers, but the previous number is summed twice instead): \n\n`[0, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29..]`\n\n*Note*: You should use provided function:\n```haskell\nscanl :: (Int -> Int -> Int) -> Int -> [Int] -> [Int]\n```",
