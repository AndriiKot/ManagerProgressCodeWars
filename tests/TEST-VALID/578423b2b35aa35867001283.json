    "description": "You are a research assistant in an experimental physics lab. Your professor asks you to write code dealing with points in two dimensions. You create a simple matrix and access it using the following notation:\n\n```javascript\narray[x][y];\n```\n\nThis allows you to handle all of the data produced by your professor's experiments.\n\nOne day, however, your professor discovers an extra dimension! You're very pleased, but now the data your professor is producing has a 'z' dimension that requires all of your array access notation to be rewritten. You change it to the following:\n\n```javascript\narray[x][y][z];\n```\n\nThen, your professor finds another dimension! Again, you update the notation:\n\n```javascript\narray[x][y][z][t];\n```\n\nThen, your professor starts talking to you about her nine, ten, even eleven dimensional theories! After marvelling at the absurdity of the universe you decide to write a function that can take coordinates as an array of any length, just in case your professor comes up with even more dimensions.\n\n```javascript\nvar search = function(array, coords) {\n  // ????\n}\n```\n\nTo keep things simple, you may assume that each dimension will be of regular length and depth. E.g. in a four dimensional matrix, each array will contain four elements (which may be arrays themselves). You should check that the correct number of coordinates have been provided and return the value of the element at those coordinates or throw an error if not.",
