    "description": "Imagine some extraordinary computers in a far far galaxy, which are based to compute not on two but **five** 'bits': `0, 1, 2, 3, 4` .\n\nIn such a computer, every register stores `n` extraterrestrial 'bits', so one such register can contain integers up to `5 ^ n` .  \nNegative numbers are represented analogously to Two's complement, i.e. `0` turns to the maximal representable number `44...4444` when decreased by `1` . E.g. `-14 = 44...4431` (with `n` digits). (For this kata, the actual cutoff between negative and positive numbers is irrelevant.)\n\nFor this kata we will let the size `n` of registers vary.\n\nAs mathematical operations are executed using single registers,  any potential overflow bits get lost. In practice, it means that only the last `n` 'bits' of the result are stored. For example, if `n = 2`, we get `12 * 12 == 44` on the register, because `12 * 12 = 144` holds even in number base `5`, and only the last `2` digits are kept. Similarly, `44 + 1 == 0` here.\n\nYour task is to write a function that returns the set of all register values `z` that satisfy `z * z == -1`, when the size of registers, `n` , is given.  \nThe expected result set contains the string representation of the solutions on `n` 'bits', i.e. with potential leading zeroes.",
