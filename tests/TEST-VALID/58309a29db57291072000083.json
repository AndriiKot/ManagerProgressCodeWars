    "description": "A group of businesspeople from various timezones around the world need to schedule a conference call at a time of the day which works for everyone.\n\nFor each person, their business hours are **9 AM–5 PM** local time and their \"reasonable hours\" are **7 AM–9 PM** local time.\n\n### Arguments\n\n  * an array of time offsets from UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) (always multiples of 0.5), \n  * the length of the call (always a multiple of 0.5).\n\nFor example: input `[-2, 4.5], 1.5` means there are two people, one living in UTC-02:00 (behind) and one in UTC+04:30 (ahead). The first person's business hours are 11 AM–7 PM UTC, the second's 4:30 AM—12:30 PM UTC. Just enough overlap to fit the 1.5-hr long call in both of their business hours.\n\n### Return value\n  \nAn array of two elements: \n\n  * the starting time of the call in UTC in the 24-hr format,\n  * a flag:\n    * `0` if the *entire* call fits into everyone's business hours\n    * `1` if it fits at least into everyone's reasonable hours\n    * `2` otherwise\n    \nFor the example above, the output would be `[11, 0]`.\n\n### Rules\n\n* Fit the call entirely in everyone's business hours.\n  * If more than one solution is possible, pick the earliest one (in UTC).\n* If not possible:\n  * Maximize the number of people who are in their reasonable hours throughout the call.\n  * If more than one solution is possible, maximize the number of people in their *business* hours throughout the call.\n  * If more than one solution is still possible, pick the earliest one (in UTC).\n\nNote: if in the middle of the call someone's business hours end and, *at the same time*, someone else's start, we count that as 1 person being in their business hours throughout the call. But if there is a 30 minute gap, for example, then we obviously can't count that as \"1 person being in their business hours *throughout* the call.\" (Same for reasonable hours.)\n\nNote: UTC-12 === UTC+12; that is, we don't care about days of the week.",
