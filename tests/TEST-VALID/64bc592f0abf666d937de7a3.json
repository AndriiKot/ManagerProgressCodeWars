    "description": "In the mystical world of alchemy, an adept alchemist faces the challenging task of crafting a potent magick potion with a specific concentration. This extraordinary elixir must be formed by skillfully blending two preexisting mixtures, each boasting distinct concentrations of mystical elements.\n\nTo illustrate, envision a scenario where the alchemist seeks to create a 500ml potion of precisely 40% concentration. To achieve this mystical harmony, they ingeniously combine 250ml of a 30% solution with an equal measure of 250ml from a 50% solution. Through this artful alchemical union, the desired 40% potion emerges, brimming with mystical power and potential.\n\nAs input you get the desired volume in milliliters (`volume`), the desired concentration in percentage (`c0`), and the already available concentrations (`c1` and `c2`).\n\nThe output should be a list with the volumes in milliliters of mixture 1 and 2, i.e., in the example above: `[250, 250]`.  If it is not possible to create a mixture with the desired properties the result should be `[0, 0]`.\n",
