    "description": "It is Christmas time at the Office !\n\nEveryone is piling gifts in the break room and you get to choose one from each pile as you got in early, being assitant Regional manager has its perks!\n\nHowever, if you pick the exact set of gifts that Michael would want you are fired, and if your sixth-sense notes that some of the gifts are missing then you fire up your pepper spray and go looking for the thief.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=462w5DGSDIM\n\nProblem :\n\nGiven a set of integers which represent the number of unique gifts each office member is contributing, determine the probability (as a decimal, rounded to 4 places - Shrutes take probability seriously) that you will get fired.\n\nHowever if any gifts are missing (any of the contributions are negative) then return \"Thief!\". \n\nEx. \n\n[1,4]       -- Right 0.25\n\n\n[1,4,6,-2]  -- Left \"Thief!\"\n\n--\n\nWithout the back story, if you are given a number of piles of distinct objects (the number in the pile is an element in the array), what is the probability of getting any one particular set when you picking one from each pile at random. \n\n\n```haskell\nUse Right for the probability and Left for the string. The gift array can be positive or negative Int's but won't contain zeros. \n```",
