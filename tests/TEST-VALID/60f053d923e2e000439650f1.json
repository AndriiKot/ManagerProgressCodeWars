    "description": "Fibonacci has lost his marbles! A number in his sequence is incorrect, can you find it for him?\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...\n\nIf you hadn't noticed, each new number is the sum of the two before: \n\n1 + 1 = 2 \n\n1 + 2 = 3\n\n2 + 3 = 5\n\n3 + 5 = 8\n\nAnd so on...\nWhich starts with 1, 1\n\n\nComplete the function so that for any section of the Fibonacci sequence given, the incorrect number is returned\n\n\nYou will be given an array with elements of the sequence in order at random sections of the sequence, this array will never be empty (at least length 4) and only 1 inccorect number will be in it\n\nThe incorrect number will replace the number that should have been there\n\nFor example\n\n[3, 5, 8, 17, 21]  \nShould return 17 as 13 should be there instead\n\n[21, 3, 5, 8, 13]  \nShould return 21 as 2 should be there instead",
