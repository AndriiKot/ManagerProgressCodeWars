    "description": "You have to fill an int Array with numbers from 0 to 3999999.\n\nThe numbers have to be in ascending order.\n\nBut there is a problem. You have to do this very quick.\nBesides, the content will be asserted, there is also a time measurement.\nIf your code is too slow, your solution is not valid.\nBut don't be afraid, the time measurement uses 50 runs and uses the average.\nAlso the allowed time will be always calculated on the fly.\nSo also when Code Wars is slow, you should get an comparable result.\n\nIf you think, this was too easy, then try \"Performance #3 - Fill an Int-Array - Need Highest Speed\". ;-)",
