    "description": "# Advanced Types\nThis kata is purely an exercise in advanced types. Only types need to be exported from your solution, and this will involve the usage of some advanced Typescript features.\n\n# The Challenge\nExport the type `Range<N extends number>` (with any number of additional optional type parameters) such that `Range<n>` gives a union of the numbers from 1 to n. For example, `Range<4> = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4`.\n\n## Restrictions\n* This should work for values of N up to at least 25.\n* N will always be provided as an integer value greater than 0.\n\n## Note\nDue to the nature of the testing framework, we can't directly test the types exported. As such, the tests are designed so that they will only compile if the solution is valid, and in such a way that the compiler errors provide some insight into the failure. If you can get the tests to compile, they will pass!",
