    "description": "## Overview\n\nImagine that you work as a Data Scientist and you are tasked with creating an algorithm that will classify a huge amount of data. But how do we test the accuracy of that algorithm?\n\nThere are many ways to do this. In our case, we will use such a popular thing as [F-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score).\n\nThe input will be a ready report of the algorithm. Based on this information you will need to write an F-score function that will evaluate the performance of the algorithm.\n\nTo calculate the F-score use the formula:\n\n* ```math\n\\displaystyle F = 2\\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{precision} \\cdot \\mathrm{recall}}{\\mathrm{precision} + \\mathrm{recall}}\n```\n\nTo calculate precision and recall use the formulas:\n* ```math\n\\displaystyle \\mathrm{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP+FP}\n```\n* ```math\n\\displaystyle \\mathrm{Recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP+FN}\n```\n\n**Note:**\nIf one of the `TP+FP` or `TP+FN` is zero, then the F-score should be zero. But if both values are zero, the function should return 0.5 (because the accuracy will be 50%).\nAlso, if *Precision* and *Recall* are zero, F-score should return zero\n\n### Input:\n\nThere are 4 values at the input:\n* `TP` (True Positive) - values that were correctly classified as positive\n* `FP` (False Positive) - values that were correctly classified as negative\n* `TN` (True Negative) - values that were wrongly classified as positive\n* `FN` (False Negative) - values that were wrongly classified as negative\n\nHappy coding :)",
