    "description": "EUI-64 is a common method to generate an interface id for the local-link IPv6 addresses.\n\nAn Ethernet 48-bit MAC address is a combination of a 24-bit Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI) and a 24-bit device identifier, written in hexadecimal.\n\nThe modified EUI-64 takes 48-bit MAC address as input, insert `fffe` between the OUI and device identifier, then invert the U/L bit, which is the bit 1 of the highest byte of the MAC address.\n\nThe process would be:\n\n```\n00:50:3e:12:34:56         # sample mac address\n00:50:3e:ff:fe:12:34:56   # insert ff:fe\n02:50:3e:ff:fe:12:34:56   # invert bit 1 of the highest byte\n```\n\nNormally IPv6 address is represented in group of 16 bits (called hextet), so the final interface id should look like `0250:3eff:fe12:3456`.\n\nWrite a function which takes a string representation of a MAC address, and returns the interface id generated using the EUI-64 method.\n\n**Note**: all hexadecimal characters should be in lower case.",
