    "description": "For this exercise you will have to implement the following algorithm in order to estimate the reading time of an article:\n\n1. Find your total word count.\n2. Divide your total word count by 200\n3. The first part of your previous decimal number is your minute\n4. Take the second part — the decimal points — and multiply that by 0.60. Keep only the first two decimals and those are your seconds.\n5. print the output in the format `Time to read: n minutes and m seconds`\n\n\nExample\n---\n\ninput: `\"Convert words into minutes here, some decimals into seconds there, a little rounding at the end… and you can calculate estimated time to read manually\"`\n\n1. word count: 25\n2. 0.125\n3. minutes: 0\n4. seconds: 7\n5. \"Time to read: 0 minutes and 7 seconds\"\n\noutput:\n\n> \"Time to read: 0 minutes and 7 seconds\"\n\n\nExtra reading\n---\n\nhttps://marketingland.com/estimated-reading-times-increase-engagement-79830",
