    "description": "# Overview\n\nIn this kata you will implement a whacky way to transmit messages via [Morse-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) over the duration of the execution of a function.\n\n# Task\n\nImplement the class `Morser` with the functions `beep` and `append_to_buffer`.\n\n1. Buffer Management:  \n   - The `add_to_buffer(msg)` method appends the given string `msg` to the Morser’s internal buffer.  \n   - The `beep()` method, when called repeatedly, will send the Morse code for each character in the buffer until it is fully transmitted.\n\n2. Morse Timing Rules:  \n   - Each Morse character is made up of dots (`.`) and dashes (`-`).\n   - A dot lasts 1 \"dit\" unit (about 1 ms).\n   - A dash lasts 4 \"dit\" units (about 4 ms).\n   - After a full character is sent, there is an 8-dit (8 ms) pause before the next character.\n   - Spaces between words are transmitted as a 12-dit (12 ms) pause.\n\n3. Empty Buffer Behavior:  \n   - Once the entire buffer has been transmitted, any further calls to `beep()` should finish as quickly as possible, signaling to the `Decoder` that the transmission has ended.\n\n4. Character Encoding:  \n   - All letters should be treated as uppercase.\n   - A predefined dictionary `MORSE` maps each character (A-Z, 0-9) to its Morse code sequence.\n\n# Example\n```\nm = Morser()\nm.add_to_buffer(\"HELLO\")\n```\n\nThe Morse code for `H` is `....` (four dots). Calling `m.beep()` four times will each take 1 ms (for each dot). After sending these four dots, the next `m.beep()` call will take 8 ms to indicate that `H` is complete.\n\nThen for `E` (which is `.`), one `m.beep()` call takes 1 ms for the dot, followed by another `m.beep()` of 8 ms to mark the end of the character.\n\nThis pattern continues for `L` (`.-..`) and `O` (`---`), each time sending dots and dashes with their respective timings, and then an 8 ms pause after the character.\n\nWhen all characters have been sent, subsequent calls to `m.beep()` complete as quickly as possible to signal that the entire message has been transmitted.\n\nUsing the preloded `Decoder`, a message of a `Morser` with a filled buffer, can be decoded:\n\n```\nd = Decoder()\nresult = d.decode(m.beep)\n```\n\nHere `result` should be `\"HELLO\"`.\n",
