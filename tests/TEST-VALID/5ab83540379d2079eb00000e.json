    "description": "This kata is based off another popular kata of the same name, but with much stricter performance requirements and one or two additions.\n\nThe goal is to find all the divisors of a given number (except 1 and itself), and return them as an array (the order doesn't matter). If the number is prime, return \"(number) is prime\". If the number is anything other than an integer, or < 2, throw an error of your choosing (we wouldn't want our function returning something like 'string is prime')\n\nExamples:\n```javascript\ngetDivs(625) => [5, 25, 125]\ngetDivs(2136195961) => [46219]\ngetDivs(\"-22.5\") => Should throw an error\ngetDivs(872568404527691) => '872568404527691 is prime'\n```\nNote that although the performance requirements are astronomically higher than \"Find the divisors!\", you still don't need the world's fastest algorithm, or one that uses pure math.\n\nMake sure you're not doing more work than you need to.\n\nHave fun!",
