    "description": "To solve this kata, you  to create a character class that can be used for a roguelike game. Instances of this class must have the characteristics strength, dexterity and intelligence and can call some test-generated methods that will change these characteristics or give the character a new weapon.\n\nThe Character class must have 2 mandatory instance methods - one will display character information and the other will display the event log. Only these output methods will be checked by tests The names of the properties or how the user stores any values is entirely up to the user and individual properties will not be checked.\n\nCharacter\n-\nThe character has a `name` and 3 main characteristics: `strength`, `dexterity`, `intelligence`. Name and characteristics are set randomly when creating a character; if some characteristic is not specified, then the default value is taken equal to `10`, name default value is `'Hero'`. Initially, the character is armed only with his `'limbs'`(lowercase), the damage from which is equal to the sum of his characteristics.\n\n```ruby\nch = Character.new(name: 'Kroker', strength: 15, intelligence: 7)\n```\n```javascript\nconst ch = new Character({name: 'Kroker', strength: 15, intelligence: 7});\n```\n```python\nch = Character(name='Kroker', strength=15, intelligence=7)\n```\n```dart\ndynamic ch = Character(name: 'Kroker', strength: 15, intelligence: 7);\n```\n\nThe method giving the character's info returns a multiline string. Let's check, the missing characteristic will be equal to 10, and the weapon will be `'limbs'`\n\n```ruby\nputs ch.character_info #=> \"Kroker\\nstr 15\\ndex 10\\nint 7\\nlimbs 32 dmg\"\n```\n```javascript\nconsole.log(ch.characterInfo()); //=> `Kroker\\nstr 15\\ndex 10\\nint 7\\nlimbs 32 dmg`\n```\n```python\nprint(ch.character_info()) #=> \"Kroker\\nstr 15\\ndex 10\\nint 7\\nlimbs 32 dmg\"\n```\n```dart\nprint(ch.characterInfo()); //=> \"Kroker\\nstr 15\\ndex 10\\nint 7\\nlimbs 32 dmg\"\n```\n\n```\nKroker\nstr 15\ndex 10\nint 7\nlimbs 32 dmg\n```\n\nThe character finds a weapon\n-\nWeapons can be found using an instance method, the name of which is the name of the weapon. The name of the weapon method can be anything, but always consists of 3 words: the type of weapon (for example, \"axe\"), the word \"of\" and the property of the weapon (for example, \"fire\").\n\n```ruby\nch.axe_of_fire(3, 1, 0, 20) # weapon method name can be anything as long as it matches weapon_of_something\n```\n```javascript\nch.axeOfFire(3, 1, 0, 20); // weapon method name can be anything as long as it matches weaponOfSomething\n```\n```python\nch.axe_of_fire(3, 1, 0, 20) # weapon method name can be anything as long as it matches weapon_of_something\n```\n```dart\nch.axeOfFire(3, 1, 0, 20); // weapon method name can be anything as long as it matches weaponOfSomething\n```\n\nWeapon damage is set by parameters passed to the method, which give damage depending on characteristics and additional damage.(always the order: strength, dexterity, intellect, extra damage), the number of parameters are always 4.\n\nIn this case, the Axe of fire has parameters `3, 1, 0, 20`. This means that the damage from this weapon will be calculated according to the formula\n\n```math\n3 \\times strength + 1 \\times dexterity + 0 \\times intelligence + 20 = 3 \\times 15 + 1 \\times 10 + 0 \\times 7 + 20 = 75\n```\n\nThe weapon and its total damage should appear in the character info output. Damage computation calculation, hence the output of the character info thing is done with the stats of the Character at call time. Since the `'Axe of fire'`, unlike the `'limbs'`, is a name, it must be capitalized\n\n```\nKroker\nstr 15\ndex 10\nint 7\nAxe of fire 75 dmg\n```\n\nAll events with found weapons go into the event log\n\n```ruby\nputs ch.event_log\n```\n```javascript\nconsole.log(ch.eventLog());\n```\n```python\nprint(ch.event_log())\n```\n```dart\nprint(ch.eventLog());\n```\n\n```\nKroker finds 'Axe of fire'\n```\n\nThe character finds another weapon that will do more damage\n-\n\nThe character should always choose the weapon with the highest damage, if he received a stronger weapon, If 2 weapons have the same damage, then choose the first one in alphabetical order.\n\n```ruby\nch.staff_of_water(1, 0, 2, 60)\n```\n```javascript\nch.staffOfWater(1, 0, 2, 60);\n```\n```python\nch.staff_of_water(1, 0, 2, 60)\n```\n```dart\nch.staffOfWater(1, 0, 2, 60);\n```\n\nStaff of water has 89 damage`(1 * 15 + 0 * 10 + 7 * 2 + 60)` this is more than the 'Axe of fire', which means we need to change weapons.\n\n```\nKroker\nstr 15\ndex 10\nint 7\nStaff of water 89 dmg\n```\n\nThe character retains all the weapons found, that is, although we replaced the 'Axe of fire' with the 'Staff of water', the 'Axe of fire' will remain in the character's inventory\n\nEnhancement\n-\nIf a character has 2 weapons with the same name, then he enhances one of them and destroys the other.\n\n```ruby\nch.axe_of_fire(1, 2, 1, 10)\n```\n```javascript\nch.axeOfFire(1, 2, 1, 10);\n```\n```python\nch.axe_of_fire(1, 2, 1, 10)\n```\n```dart\nch.axeOfFire(1, 2, 1, 10);\n```\n\nNow there are 2 'Axe of fire', so let's enhance one of them by destroying the other one. The enhancement will make each damage parameter maximum from those of the 2 original weapons.\n```math\n(3, 1, 0, 20) and (1, 2, 1, 10) \\Rightarrow (max(3,1), max(1,2), max(0,1), max(20,10)) \\Rightarrow (3, 2, 1, 20)\n```\nThe character info output shows enhanced weapons. In the output, `'(enhanced)'` is added to the name of the improved weapon\n\n```\nKroker\nstr 15\ndex 10\nint 7\nAxe of fire(enhanced) 92 dmg\n```\n\nFor the new enhancement, an `'(enhanced)'` weapon is considered the same as a non-enhanced weapon with the same name. For example: from `'Axe of fire(enhanced)'` and new `'Axe of fire'` we will make an enhancement and get new `'Axe of fire(enhanced)'`\n\nRandom events that changes characteristics\n-\nCharacter characteristics can be affected by random events. An event occurs using an instance method, the name of which is the name of the event, and the parameters (the order is always: strength, dexterity, intelligence; quantity is always 3) are stat modifiers\n\n```ruby\nch.strange_fruit(-2, 0, 2)\n```\n```javascript\nch.strangeFruit(-2, 0, 2);\n```\n```python\nch.strange_fruit(-2, 0, 2)\n```\n```dart\nch.strangeFruit(-2, 0, 2);\n```\n\nThe 'Strange fruit' does not change dexterity, as the 2nd coefficient is 0, but it adds -2 strength and +2 intelligence.\n\nThe character should always choose the weapon with the highest damage; if a random event changed characteristics so that some weapon from the previously found one became stronger than the one equipped, then you need to change to a stronger one from the inventory. Accordingly, we change the 'Axe of fire(enhanced)'  back to the 'Staff of water'\n\n```\nKroker\nstr 13\ndex 10\nint 9\nStaff of water 91 dmg\n```\n\nAll random events end up in the event log. For random events, you do not need to specify modifiers equal to 0, but only those that changed the character's characteristics.\n\nEvent log displays all events in order\n-\n\nEvent log method returns all events as a string. Each event on a new line.\n\n```ruby\nputs ch.event_log\n```\n```javascript\nconsole.log(ch.eventLog());\n```\n```python\nprint(ch.event_log())\n```\n```dart\nprint(ch.eventLog());\n```\n```\nKroker finds 'Axe of fire'\nKroker finds 'Staff of water'\nKroker finds 'Axe of fire'\nStrange fruit: strength -2, intelligence +2\n```",

    "description": "The fight between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson, the 2 best lightweight MMA fighters of the 2nd half of the 2010s, failed 5 times for various reasons and never took place. But what if their fight did happen, how would it end? So, in a parallel universe, the fighters entered the cage. At the commentary table are Joe Rogan and Nate Diaz. But there is one problem, your pirate stream has stopped showing the picture, so you only need their comments to understand what is happening in the fight.\n\nDescription:\n-\nIn this kata you will be given a string with comments from Joe and Nate. Based on the sequence of words from this string, you will need to determine the result of the fight between Khabib and Tony.\n\nInput:\n-\n__You get a string containing 3 types of words:__\n1. Khabib's actions: `'jab'`, `'overhand'`, `'takedown'`, `'hammerfist'`\n2. Tony's actions: `'elbow'`, `'punch'`, `'kick'`, `'imanary'`\n3. The action may belong to either Khabib or Tony depending on the context: `'submission'`\n4. Words from Joe and Nate that have nothing to do with the actions of the fighters\n\nRules:\n-\n\n__The fight can take place in 2 main positions, standing and on the floor.__\n1. Starting position _standing_\n2. Actions that mean that the position is now standing (change the position if it was on the floor, the position changes before calculating the damage for this action): `'jab'`, `'overhand'`, `'punch'`, `'kick'`\n3. Actions that mean that the position is now on the floor (change the position if it was standing, the position changes before calculating the damage for this action): `'takedown'`, `'hammerfist'`, `'imanary'`\n4. Actions that do not change the position (the position remains the same as it was during the previous action): `'elbow'`, `'submission'`\n\n__Rules for dealing damage and scoring judge's points for each action:__\n1. Initially, both fighters have _100 hit points_ and _0 judge's points_\n2. Upper case and with an exclamation mark - damage is _10 hit points_, reward _2 judge's points_. Example: `'ELBOW!'`\n3. Upper case - damage is _5 hit points_, reward _2 judge's points_. Example: `'ELBOW'`\n4. With an exclamation mark - damage _3 hit points_, reward _2 judge's points_. Examples: `'elbow!'` or `'Elbow!'`\n5. Without an exclamation point and not the entire word in upper case - damage _1 hit point_, reward 1 _judge's point_. Examples: `'elbow'` or `'Elbow'`\n6. Damage is always _0 hit point_ (regardless of case or exclamation mark) if the action is: `'takedown'`, `'submission'`, `'imanary'`. Judge's points for the actions `'takedown'`, `'imanary'` are awarded according to the normal rules. For `'submission'` judge's points are awarded only if the rule for submission described in the next paragraph is met\n\n__Submission__ is always carried out by the fighter whose hit points are greater than those of the opponent, while the opponent's remaining hit points must be _less than 20_. Otherwise, the submission is considered unsuccessful and does not bring judge's points to anyone, so it doesn't matter to us who performed it\n\n__The result of the battle can be:__\n1. __Submission__. To win using this method, it is necessary (in addition to the conditions for submission in the paragraph above) that the difference in the number of hit points between the attacker and opponent is greater than 10 if the position is standing otherwise by 5 if the position is on the floor.\n    * _Submission example 1_ (Tony: 25hp, Khabib: 20hp, action: `'submission'`): 25 > 20 Tony makes a submission attempt; 20 >= 20 Khabib defends too easily and therefore the judges do not give Tony points.\n    * _Submission example 2_ (Tony: 25hp, Khabib: 19hp, position: standing, action: `'SUBMISSION!'`): 25 > 19 Tony makes a submission attempt; 19 < 20 The judges give Tony 2 points; 25 - 19 <= 10 Failed to finish off Khabib, the fight continues\n    * _Submission example 3_ (Tony 25hp, Khabib 19hp, position: on the floor, action: `'submission'`): 25 > 19 Tony makes a submission attempt; 19 < 20 The judges give Tony 1 point; 25 - 19 > 5 Tony won by submission\n* Output: `'Khabib won by submission'` or `'Tony won by submission'`\n2. __Knockout__. To win by knockout, you need to deal 10 damage in one action and the remaining (remaining before this action) hit points were less than: for Tony, 30 hit points if the position is on the floor, otherwise 20 if the position is standing. For Khabib, 30 hit points if the position is standing otherwise 20 if the position is on the floor.\n    * _Knockout example 1_ (Khabib: 25hp, action: `'KICK!'`): This action means that the position is standing and the damage is 10; 25 < 30 Tony wins by knockout\n    * _Knockout example 2_ (Khabib: 25hp, position: on the floor, action: `'ELBOW!'`): 25 >= 20 Tony deals 10 damage and gets 2 points from the judges, but no knockout occurs, the fight continues\n    * _Knockout example 3_ (Tony 29hp, action: `'HAMMERFIST!'`): This action means that the position is on the floor and the damage is 10; 29 < 30 Khabib wins by knockout\n    * _Knockout example 4_ (Tony 18hp, action: `'OVERHAND!'`): This action means that the position is standing and the damage is 10; 18 < 20 Khabib wins by knockout\n* Output: `'Khabib won by KO'` or `'Tony won by KO'`\n3. __Technical knockout__. To win using this method, the hit points of one of the fighters must become 0 or less. (if both a knockout and technical knockout occurred at the same time, then the result is a knockout)\n* Output: `'Khabib won by TKO'` or `'Tony won by TKO'`\n4. __Victory on points__. Possible if no one has won ahead of schedule until the end of the battle, then you need to count the judges' points, whoever scored more wins, or a draw if there is a tie\n* Output: `'Khabib won by decision'` or `'Tony won by decision'` or `'Draw'`\n\nThere is strange smoke and a suspicious smell coming from Joe and Nate, so they can continue to comment on the fight even if it has already ended early by knockout or submission, you should not pay attention to them after that",
