    "description": "Write an object constructor for darts games!\n============================================\n\nYou should probably read or refresh your knowledge about the rules your games will be played from:\nhttp://www.flyordie.com/games/help/darts/en/game_rules_501.html\n\n( So 'double out' will be needed. Also, I didn't implement most of the `III. End of the game` section to the tests, so you guys won't have to worry about counting rounds.)\n\nArguments for the constructor:\n------------------------------\n- `players`, an  array of player names, eg.:\n```javascript\n['Huey','Dewey','Louie']\n```\n\n- `game`\n - a starting score for each player to begin with, should be 301,501,701 or 901\n - if it isn't one of thoose, set it to 501\n\nProperties and Methods I will test for:\n---------------------------------------\n- `.points`\n - an object, its keys shall be the player names, and the values should equal the current points of the players\n ```javascript\n{'Player1':321, 'Player2':501, 'Player3':501}\n```\n \n\n- `.score(player, [value1, value2, value3])`\n - removes points of the player if it isn't a bust\n\n - values given will ALWAYS be VALID strings, following the notation:\n ```\nsimple 7    => '7'\nsimple 20   => '20'\ndouble 20   => 'd20'\ntriple 20   => 't20'\nsimple bull => '25'\nbullseye    => 'd25'\nmiss\t    => '0'\n```\n\n- `.state()`, returns 'Game still in progress'\n\tor 'Game won by Y'",
