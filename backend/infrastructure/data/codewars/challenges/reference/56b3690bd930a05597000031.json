    "description": "A vanity plate is a custom license plate that will usually contain a word or abbreviation. If a word or phrase doesn't fit on a license plate, peoplewill often remove the vowels and the word can still be understood.  \n  \n\nFor this kata, the maximum charactar count on a license plate is 8, that includes letters numbers and spaces  \n  \nYour goal is to write a program that takes a string as an input and returns a string that could be put on a license plate.  \nIf the input string is 8 or less characters, return the input string  \n  \nIf the string is more than 8 characters, remove all vowels excluding vowels at the beginning and end of words.  If that string is 8 or less characters,return it.  \n  \nIf that is still too many characters, remove spaces between words.   \n  \nIf the string is still not within the character limit, return a string that has the first letter of each word without spaces, like an anagram. \n  \nIf that still fails return an empty string.  \n  \nRegardless of the input string your return value should have only capital letters  \n  \nSome examples:\n```python\nvanity_plate(\"boss\")\nreturn \"BOSS\"\n\nvanity_plate(\"boss dude\")\nreturn \"BSS DDE\"\n\nvanity_plate(\"b0ss dude\")\nreturn \"B0SS DDE\"\n\nvanity_plate(\"the big boss\")\nreturn \"THEBGBSS\"\n\nvanity_plate(\"the biggest boss around\")\nreturn \"TBBA\"\n```\nnotes:  \ncount \"y\" as a vowel  \nThe input string will always be a string of words made up of 1 or more lettters and numbers with a single space inbetween each word.",
