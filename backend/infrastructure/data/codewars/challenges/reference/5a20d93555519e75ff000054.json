    "description": "It's class picture day!  Everyone in Ms. Frizzle's third grade class showed up in their Sunday best to take a proper class picture together.  In the excitement, the kids jumped out of their seats and are now talking amongst themselves scattered about.  \n\nMs. Frizzle is not liking the chaos, but she has thought up a way to get the students neatly lined up to take a nice picture.  She will organize the students by height, from shortest to tallest.  By doing so, she will ensure an uniformly balanced picture where everyone's faces are showing.  Please help Ms. Fizzle make this happen in the quickest way possible so they can all get lined up and head for that picture!",
