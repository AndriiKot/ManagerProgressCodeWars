    "description": "  Welcome to the Debug the Buggy Bug Bug Challenge! This is my first kata so please no hateful comments! In this challenge you will have to figure out what is wrong with the code. This is pretty standard but then again, this is my first kata.\n\n  Objectives\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n  1. Alter the code to where it can pass throught the function and come out with the result of \"Hello (the name        passed through). Welcome to Javascript!\"\n\n  2. After you are done, make sure you comment and refactor your code and then submit your solution.\n\n  3. Clean up all uneccessary code;\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nI hope you enjoy this kata. I plan on making more in the future so please help by solving this kata and helping it get out of the beta phase! Good luck!",
