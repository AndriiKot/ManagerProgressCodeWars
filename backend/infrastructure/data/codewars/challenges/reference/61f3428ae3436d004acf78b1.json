    "description": "FizzBuzz!\n  If you're not familiar with fizzbuzz it's a fairly simple \"game\". You will be given a number 'n' and will need to determine if it is perfectly divisible by 3, 5 and both 3 and 5. If the given integer is perfectly divisible by 3 it's a Fizz, if the number is perfectly divisible by 5 it's a Buzz and if it's perfectly divisible by both 3 and 5 it's FizzBuzz.\n  \n\nYour task, should you choose to accept it is to return a Dictionary object with the integer of the perfectly divisible Fizz, Buzz or FizzBuzz as well as a string of the aforementioned classifications up to and including the given integer excluding 0. You will not receive non-integer values.",
