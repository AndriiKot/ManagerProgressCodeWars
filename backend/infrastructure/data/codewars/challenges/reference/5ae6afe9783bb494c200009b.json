    "description": "Watson gives Sherlock an array of integers. His challenge is to find an element of the array such that the sum of all elements to the left is equal to the sum of all elements to the right. For instance, given the array `[5,6,8,11]`, `8` is between two subarray that sum to `11`.\nIf your starting array is `[1]`, that element **satisfies** the rule as left and right sum to `0`.\n\nYou will be given arrays of integers and must determine whether there is an element that meets the criterion.\n\nInput Format\n---\n\nThe first line contains `T`, the number of test cases.\n\nThe next `T` pairs of lines each represent a test case.\n- The first line contains `n`, the number of elements in the array `a`.\n- The second line for each test case contains `n` space-separated integers a<sub>i</sub> where `0 <= i < n`.\n\nConstraints\n---\n\n```\n1 <= T <= 10\n1 < n < 10^5\n1 <= a_i <= 2 x 10^4\n0 <= i < n\n```\n\n\nOutput Format\n---\n\nFor each test case print YES if there exists an element in the array, such that the sum of the elements on its left is equal to the sum of the elements on its right; otherwise print NO.\n\nSample Input\n---\n\n```\n2\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 3\n```\n\nSample Output\n---\n\n```\nNO\nYES\n```\n\nExplanation\n---\n\nFor the first test case, no such index exists.\nFor the second test case, `A[0] + A[1] = 3`, therefore index `2` satisfies the given conditions.\n\n\nNote\n---\n\nIf you have troubles passing this Kata try this related excersise first since you should provide a linear or nearly linear time solution:\n\nhttps://www.codewars.com/kata/equal-sides-of-an-array/",
