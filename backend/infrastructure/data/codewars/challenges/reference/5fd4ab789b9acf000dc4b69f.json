    "description": "## Did i survive?\n\nImagine you are a **Hero**, you are going to take damage from your enemy. The damage can be fatal, you might die cause of it.\n\n### Task\nWrite a function that accept 3 parameters, `health`, `reduction`, and `damage`. Your task is calculate the damage taken from your enemy and return `'Survived!'` if `result > 0`, otherwise return `'Dead!'`.\n\nExample:\n\n`currentLife('246/977', 42, '322')`\n\nParameter explanation:\n\n- `'246/977'` is your health in the following format (`currentHealth/maximumHealth`)\n- `42` is your armor, it will reduce the damage taken by percentage (42 it's mean 42%). In this case it will reduce the incoming damage by 42% before take out your current health\n- `'322'` is your enemy damage, this value should be reduced by armor before taking your current health\n\n### note:\n- Final result of calculation must be rounded down!\n\nFrom above example the result must be `59`. So the function should return `'Survived!'`\n\nYou may notice the maximumHealth is do nothing. In another example there's will be used. If third parameter contain `%` this symbol the calculation will be different. See below:\n\n`currentLife('246/977', 42, '44%')`\n\nIf the third parameter contain `%`, the value of damage must be `maximumHealth * (44 / 100)`. The rest calculation remain same. From recent example the result must be `-4`, as you see, the function should return `'Dead!'`.\n\n### Good luck Hero!!",
