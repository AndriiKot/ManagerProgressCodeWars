    "description": "You will write a battleAlgorithim that takes two Javascript player objects.\n\ne.g. function battleAlgorithim (player1, player2) {}\n\nA player object has a health and attack attribute (attack can never be 0 nor less).\n\ne.g. player1 = {'health': 20, 'attack': 5}\n\nYou will attack for as many turns as it takes for one player to die. Each turn, an attack consists of subtracting one player's attack stat from the other player's health. If either player has 0 or less health at the end of the turn, the game is over.\n\nAt the end, you will return an array with two values. First, an integer, the amount of turns past before one or both players die. Second, a string, that says \"Game over! Mutual death! Everyone loses!\" if both players died, and \"Player[i] wins!\" if player[i] is the sole survivor. \n\nSmall helper functions will help keep code concise in this problem.\n",
