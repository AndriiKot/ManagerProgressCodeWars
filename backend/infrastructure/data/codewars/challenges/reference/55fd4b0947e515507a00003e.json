    "description": "Write a function ```liveRatings``` that would take as argument an array of objects, each object represents a chess player(the list is ordered by rating). A chess player has a ```rank```, ```name```,```rating``` and ```points```(gains or losses), your task is to add the ```points``` to the ```rating``` and return a new list ordered by the new ```rating```. Remember to update the rank according to the rating.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\n[{rank: 1, name: 'Carlsen', rating: 2850, points: -5.3},\n {rank: 2, name: 'Aronian', rating: 2815, points: 30}];\n```\n\nreturn\n```javascript\n[{rank: 1, name: 'Aronian', rating: 2845, points: 30},\n {rank: 2, name: 'Carlsen', rating: 2844.7, points: -5.3}]\n```",
