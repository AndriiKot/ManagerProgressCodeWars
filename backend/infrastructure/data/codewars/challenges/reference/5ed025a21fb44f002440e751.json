    "description": "You are given a target value N and a list of different coin values. Given these values, find the minumum number of coins that have to be used to obtain a sum of N. \n\n\nMultiple of the same coin can be used. All given coin values are guaranteed to be positive and distinct. Coin values will not exceed 999999, and there will not be more than 10000 unique coin values. The target value will not exceed 1000000.\n\n\nOutput one integer, which is the answer: the minumum number of coins needed from the given coins to obtain a sum of N. If it isn't possible to reach the target value with the given coins, then output -1.\n\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nN = 5\nCoin values = {1, 2, 3}\n\nAnswer = 2\n\nExplanation: You can use only two coins by having one coin of value 2 and one coin of value 3 to reach the target value of 1.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nN = 100\nCoin values = {2, 101}\n\nAnswer = 50\n\nExplanation: The only way to reach the target value of 100 is by using 50 coins of value 2.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nN = 100\nCoin values = {3, 99}\n\nAnswer = -1\n\nExplanation: There is no way to reach the target value of 100 by only using coins of values 3 and 99.",
