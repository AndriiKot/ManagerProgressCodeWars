    "description": "You are given a grid that represents a map with obstacles. Your task is to count the number of possible paths from the top left corner to the bottom right corner with only two moves: either right or down. Some cells are occupied, you cannot go through these cells. A path that goes through an occupied cell should not be counted.\n\n## Example\n\nLegend:\n\n- `S`: Start cell\n- `E`: Finish cell\n- `X`: Occupied cell\n\nThe following map has only 2 possible paths since the center cell is occupied. \n```\n|S| | |\n| |X| |\n| | |E|\n```\n\nThe following map has 6 possible paths.\n```\n|S| | |\n| | | |\n| | |E|\n```\n\nThe following map has no possible paths since there's a wall in the middle of the map.\n```\n|S|X| |\n| |X| |\n| |X|E|\n```\n\n## Code\nYou have to implement the `solve` function. The `grid` is a two-dimension array of integers where `0` means free and `1` means occupied. \n\nThe following array\n```\n[[0, 0], [1, 0]]\n```\n\nis equivalent to\n\n```\n|S| |\n|X|E|\n```\n\n\n",
