(for example, `2004` is a leap year, and `1901` is not a leap year)\n  * The leap year can be divided by 400. (for example, `2000` is a leap year and `1233` is not a leap year)\n  * February has 29 days in leap year and 28 days in normal year.\n  * ___Examples___\n  ```\n  2000 is a leap year; 4 is a leap year; 2008 is a leap year\n  1999 is not a leap year, 1003 is not a leap year\n  ```\n* If the date has only one digit, fill the digit with 0\n* If the input is invalid, it should return `\"Invalid!\"`,  see `Example Test Cases` for more information\n* The test year is in the range of 1585-3000\n\n",
