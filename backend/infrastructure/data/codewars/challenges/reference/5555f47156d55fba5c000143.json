    "description": "Removed due to copyright infringement.\n\n<!---\n\nVasya loves orange juice very much. That's why any food and drink in his kitchen necessarily contains orange juice. There are some drinks in his fridge, the volume fraction of orange juice in these drinks equals to some percent.\n\nLets say there are 3 drinks:\n\n```\nDrink №1 contains 50% of orange juice \nDrink №2 contains 100% of orange juice \nDrink №3 contains 50% of orange juice \n```\n  \n\nOne day Vasya decided to make himself an orange cocktail. He took equal proportions of each of these drinks and mixed them. Then he wondered, how much orange juice the cocktail has.\n\nPrint the volume fraction in percent of orange juice in Vasya's cocktail. \n\n`!`You should round your answer to the `4 digits` after decimal point.\n\n###Examples: \n\n```csharp\nCocktail.OrangeFraction(\"50 50 100\") // => \n                   Output cocktail contains 66.6667 % of orange juice\nCocktail.OrangeFraction(\"0 25 50 75\") // => \n                   Output cocktail contains 37.5000 % of orange juice\n\n```\n```javascript\norangeFraction(\"50 50 100\") // =>  Output cocktail contains 66.6667 % of orange juice\norangeFraction(\"0 25 50 75\") // => Output cocktail contains 37.5000 % of orange juice\n```\n\n\n--->",
