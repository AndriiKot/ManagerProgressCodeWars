    "description": "That's a nice sqrt you have there. Would be a shame if something were to happen to it.\n\nHowever, suppose that indeed something did happen, and you had no access to the builtin power and logarithm functions/operators, and no libraries to pull them from. It turns out that you can still compute square roots by hand; in fact, methods of doing so have been known for millenia.\n\nYour task, then, is to implement a function ```root(x)``` which approximates the square root of a real number x to within one-tenth of one percent, with the following restrictions on your code:\n\nFor Python: import nothing; do not use pow or the ** operator.\n\nIn addition to seven small fixed tests (four of which are given as examples), your code will be tested on a total of 200 random values, some with absolute values up to ```2**126```; although that sounds large, with a reasonable algorithm, performance shouldn't be an issue. Optimization is not the point of this kata. If you find that you pass the example tests but time out on the random ones, I suggest first attempting g964's kata on a similar theme here: https://www.codewars.com/kata/55efecb8680f47654c000095. Note, however, that unlike that kata, we don't want results chopped off to an integer, will test floating-point inputs, and will test negative numbers.",
