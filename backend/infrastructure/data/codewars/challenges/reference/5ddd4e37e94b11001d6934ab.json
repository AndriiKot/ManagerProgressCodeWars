    "description": "Fred has been playing golf for a year now so he is far from professional. He is a little concerned about his current scores. He wants to figure out whether he should get some practice or whether he is considered a good golfer, can you help him?\n\nThe par for an 18 hole golf course can vary between 69-72. The input (par) will be within this range.\n\nThe second input (strokes) is the number of strokes it took Fred to get around the golf course.\n\nRules:\n\n- If Fred shoots 18 or 18+ strokes above par, you should return: \"Fred, you need some practice buddy\".\n\n- If Fred shoots lower than 18 above par, you should return: \"Fred, you are considered a good golfer, good work!\".\n\nGiven the two numbers, can you work out whether Fred needs to practice or not?",
