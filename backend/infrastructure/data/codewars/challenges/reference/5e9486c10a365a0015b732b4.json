    "description": "What's the answer to life? What's the answer to the Universe? In fact, what's the answer to everything?\n\n### 42\n\nIn this kata you'll have to create a very special variable. One that holds the answers to everything. No matter what property you'll ask for, it will always answer with 42. And its name is `answerToEverything`\n\nExamples:\n```\nanswerToEverything.universe === 42\nanswerToEverything.life === 42\nanswerToEverything['Which came first, the chicken or the egg'] === 42\nanswerToEverything['are you sure?'] === 42\n```\n\nGood luck!",
