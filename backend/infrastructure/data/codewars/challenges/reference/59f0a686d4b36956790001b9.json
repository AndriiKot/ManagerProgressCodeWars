    "description": "You need to complete a Bit class, which represents a string of binary numbers, you can do and, XOR, left, right, or even the addition of the two Bit objects in your implementation, you can use the method used to achieve this function, avoid into integer to add, because the binary number may be particularly big.<br>\nAttention point:<br>\n1: when you move left and right, do not discard the previous binary bits and keep them, even if you see more redundant \"0\"\"<br>\n2: the purpose of this Kata is to exercise your bit arithmetic ability, so try not to use integer addition to add operations, even if you passed the test.<br>\n3: the result of the calculation will also return to a Bit object, because the implementation is different, so the length of the result is not necessarily the same, so I rewrote the equals method<br>\n<br>\nThe example may be clearer than I said<br>\n<br>\nA: 1001001<br>\nB: 1010110<br>\nA<<1 is 10010010<br>\nA ^ B is 0011111<br>\nA & B is 100000<br>\nA + B is 10011111<br>\n<br>\nPs: this is my first Kata, and there may be a lot of problems, please correct me ,thanks<br>",
