    "description": "BitSplit is a technique of splitting every high bit to 3 bits which consists of high, low and high bit, i.e. 1 -> BitSplit - > 101.\n\n\nNow after observing the output of this function it has been noticed that the bitlength increases dramatically for some values\n\nIn order to ensure that this does not happen, the 3 bits formed from a high bit is \"adjusted\" with the overlapping bits by performing an OR operation with each of the overlapping bits.\n\n\n**Examples**\n\n```\n1) Input =  9 \n\ndec         bin\n\n9           1 0 0 1 \n\nBitSplit  1 0 1 1 0 1     split 1st and 2nd high bit\n\n45        1 0 1 1 0 1     \n\nAnswer = 45\n\n2) Input =  12\n\ndec          bin\n\n12            1 1 0 0\n\nBitSplit    1 0 1 0 0       split 1st high bit\n            \n            0 1 0 1 0       split 2nd high bit\n\n30          1 1 1 1 0       OR Operation\n\nAnswer = 30\n\n\n3) Input = 21\n\ndec          bin\n\n21            1 0 1 0 1 \n\nBitSplit    1 0 1 0 0 0       split 1st high bit\n\n            0 0 1 0 1 0       split 2nd high bit\n            \n            0 0 0 0 1 0 1     split 3rd high bit\n\n85          1 0 1 0 1 0 1     OR  Operation \n\nAnswer = 85\n\n```\n**Note**\n\n* 0<=Input<10^7\n",
