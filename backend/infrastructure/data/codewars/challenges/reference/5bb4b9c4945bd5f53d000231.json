    "description": "On a secret factory two types of waste products are being stored.\ntype A - radioactive and type B - safe.\nThey are all being packed in special boxes and stored in lines.\nA line of boxes is considered explosive if it has at least 3 radioactive boxes in a row.\n\nYour task is to write a function explosiveAmount that returns a total amount of explosive combinations for a given number of boxes N.\n\nThe output may be REALLY big so you will have to use BigNumber.js library.\nIt is a library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.\n\nHere are some basic tools that you can use:\n```\nlet a = new BigNumber(10);\n//creates a BigNumber object with a value of 10.\n\nlet b = a.plus(2);\n//adds 2 to a.\n\nlet b = a.minus(2);\n//subtracts 2 from a.\n\nlet b = a.times(2);\n//multiplies a by 2.\n\nlet b = a.divide(2);\n//divides a by 2.\n\nlet b = a.pow(2);\n//raises a to the power of 2.\n\na.equals(b);\n//checks if a is equal to b.\n```\nExpected behavior:\n```javascript\nexplosiveAmount(5);\n//should return new BigNumber(8).\n\nexplosiveAmount(2);\n//should return new BigNumber(0).\n\nexplosiveAmount(-10);\n//should return new BigNumber(0).\n```\nGood luck!\n\nhttps://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js/ - if you want to play around with BigNumber.js yourself.",
