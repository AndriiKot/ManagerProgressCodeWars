    "description": "FYI: The solution code is really simple once you understand what's being asked.\n\nThe nearby fitness center is closing down and is offering a discounted deal on their bumper plates. The price of each bumper plate corresponds to its weight in kilograms (for instance, a 10kg bumper plate costs 10, a 5kg bumper plate costs 5). To simplify this exercise, the gym has an unlimited supply of bumper plates of any weight (whole numbers only).\n\nYour goal is to purchase the minimum number of plates required to achieve a total weight of N kg, allowing you to work out with any integer between 1 and N. In other words, you should be able to lift 1kg, 2kg, 3kg, and so on up to N kg using the plates you buy.\n\nTo solve this, create a function called least_plates(N). The function should take an integer N as input and return the minimum number of plates you need to buy.\n\nFor example, if N = 9, you would need to purchase at least 4 plates. One possible configuration for the plate weights is 1kg, 2kg, 3kg, and 3kg. Using these plates, you can lift different amounts of weight by combining them as needed.\n\n```\n1kg -> 1kg plate\n2kg -> 2kg plate\n3kg -> 3kg plate\n4kg -> 3kg and 1kg plates\n5kg -> 3kg and 2kg plates\n6kg -> 3kg and 2kg and 1kg plates\n7kg -> 3kg and 3kg and 1kg plates\n8kg -> 3kg and 3kg and 2kg\n9kg -> 3kg and 3kg and 2kg and 1kg plates\n```\n\n",
