    "description": "Given a 2D array. Your task is to write a function that would return the 2D array that is sorted in such a way that the row with minimum sum  would become the first row of sorted array, row with 2nd lowest sum would become the 2nd row of sorted array and so on..\n\nIf two rows have the same sum then the row with smaller index in input array will be placed first in sorted array.\n\nFor Example:-\n\n```cpp\n{\n{10,10,8,2,2}, //sum of row is 32\n{7,9,8,6,2},  //sum of row is 32\n{6,3,5,4,3},  //sum of row is 21\n{5,8,7,4,5}  //sum of row is 29\n}\n```\nThe function should return:\n\n```cpp\n{\n{6,3,5,4,3},\n{5,8,7,4,5},\n{10,10,8,2,2},\n{7,9,8,6,2}\n}\n```\nNote that the rows with index 0 and 1 in input array have the same sum but in sorted array the row with index 0 is placed first.\n\nNote: You will be always given non-empty array containing Positive values. The number of columns in each row will also be the same.\n\nENJOY!!\n\nTranslations are welcome!!",
