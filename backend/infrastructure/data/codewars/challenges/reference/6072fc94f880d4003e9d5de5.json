    "description": "## Welcome to Las Vegas!\n\nCongratulations, you've made it to Las Vegas! You've been dying to play the new My Little Pony slot machine. The slot has 6 wheels, and each wheel can represent 1 of 6 different ponies.\n\nThe ponies are:\n- 'r' for Rarity\n- 'p' for Pinkie Pie\n- 't' for Twilight\n- 'a' for Applejack\n- 'f' for Fluttershy\n- 'd' for Rainbow Dash\n\nThe slot machine takes $1 and will pay out as follows:\n- any 3 of one pony: **$2**\n- any 4 of one pony: **$10**\n- any 5 of one pony: **$100**\n- any 6 of one pony: **$1,000**\n\nNote that if you happen to get 3 of 2 ponies in one spin, you will get the $2 prize for both ($4 total)\n\nGiven a list of spin results (strings), calculate your return (remember to deduct the cost of the spin)\n\nHappy gambling (for adults 18 and up or wherever gambling is legal of course!) And remember, friendship is magic!",
