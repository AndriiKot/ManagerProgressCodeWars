    "description": "As you likely learned in school, you can square a binomial such as (2x - 5) to get an expression like 4x^2 - 20x + 25. While such an operation is easy for a human to do (see http://bit.ly/2n5O8xq if you have not seen these types of problems before), it is much more complicated to multiply binomials by themselves hundreds of times.\n\nYou will have to write a program that will parse a binomial given to you as a string in the form of \"(ax + b)\", multiply the binomial by itself a given number of times, and return a string containing each term and its coefficient sorted by the value of the exponent to which x is raised.\n\nFor example, if your program recieved \"(2x - 5)\" and the power 3, it should return \"8x^3 - 60x^2 + 150x - 125\".\n\nNotes:\n\nSpaces will always be included in the binomial you are given. For example, you would never be given \"2x-5\", instead, you will be given \"2x - 5\".\n\nDo not include a term if its coefficient is zero. For example, your program should never return \"3x^2 + 0x - 5\", it should instead return \"3x^2 - 5\". \n\nDo not include a coefficient if the coefficient is one. For example, your program should never return \"1x + 5\", it should instead return \"x + 5\". Additionally, your program should never return \"-1x + 5\", it should instead return \"-x + 5\".\n\nSpacing may be included in the returned string, but is not required. For example, \"3x-5\" is just as valid as \"3x - 5\".\n\nYour program should work for all integer, non-negative powers (including zero). Note that anything to the zeroth power is always one.",
