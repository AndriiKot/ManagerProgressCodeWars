    "description": "People learning Scala usually come across quite a surprise (I know I did): The fact that there is no ternary operator in Scala.\n\nHowever, Scala also lets you get very \"creative\", which is one of the many reasons I fell in love with it. In fact, it **IS** possible to make the following line compile in Scala (assuming the existence of an `Int` `age`):\n\n```\nval booze = (age < 21) ? \"Cranberry\" | \"Cosmo\"\n```\n\nWhile it's not the traditional `?:` combination known to all, I'd call `?|` a close enough substitute.\n\nSo here is your task:\n* First and foremost, make the above line of code compile.\n* Secondly, you must evalute only the block that you need. That is to say, if the condition was `true`, you MUST NOT evaluate the `false` block, regardless of whether or not you return its value, and vice-versa.\n\n\nThe test file will import every top level element that you place in the `Ternary` `package`, by using the following import line:\n\n`import Ternary._`\n\nA Note on Tests:\nTernary Operators is also expected to work in nested blocks, like so:\n`b1 ? (b2 ? 1 : 2) : 3`\nwhere `b1` and `b2` are `Boolean`s\n\n\n",
