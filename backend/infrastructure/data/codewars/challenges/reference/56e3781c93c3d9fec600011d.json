    "description": "The Look-and-say sequence, looks like this:\n```\n11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...\n```\nHere the following number is always the \"description\" of the previous, that is:\n```\n\"11\" is the previous number of \"21\" because \"11\" has \"two\" \"ones\"\n\n\"21\" is the previous number of \"1211\" because \"21\" has \"one\" \"two\" and \"one\" \"one\"\n```\nThe task for this Kata is given a number (n >= 10) return the \"previous\" number in the sequence. Here you can assume that the quantity indicator is always one digit. \n\nThe result is returned as a string.",
