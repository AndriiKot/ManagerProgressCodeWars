    "description": "*In the casino game Blackjack, a player can gain an advantage over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. \nThis is called Card Counting.*\n\nHaving more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. \nEach card is assigned a value according to the table below. \nWhen the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.\n\nCount Change: Cards:\n```\n +1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n  0: 7, 8, 9\n -1: 10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'\n```\n\nYou will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter and increment or decrement the local count variable according to the card's value (see table).\nThe function will then return a string with the current count and the string \"Bet\" if the count is positive, or \"Hold\" if the count is zero or negative. \nThe current count and the player's decision (\"Bet\" or \"Hold\") should be separated by a single space.\n\nExample Output :\n```\n\"-3 Hold\"\n\"5 Bet\"\n```\n",
