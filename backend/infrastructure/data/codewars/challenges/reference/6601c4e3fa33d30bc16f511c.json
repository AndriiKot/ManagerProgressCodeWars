    "description": "Fibonacci spent all summer holidays in granny's village. He was worried about how to determine whether number is Fibonacci number or not. Besides granny fed him very well, so numbers he thought about grew up as well ! \n\nFor given number n determine if n is Fibonacci number. \n```C#\nisFib(0) - True \nisFib(5) - True \nisFib(7) - False \n```\n\nNumbers will be EXTREMELY huge (~500 000th Fibonacci number). Have fun.",
