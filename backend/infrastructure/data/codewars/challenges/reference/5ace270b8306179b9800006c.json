    "description": "After their latest adventure defeating Bowzer, Mario and Luigi are back to their day jobs.\n\nThey are installing pipes into a large flat, but first they need to get the pipes through the corridor around a right-angle corner.\n\nMario measures in centimetres the width of the corridors before the corner (corrA) and after the corner (corrB). The store where Luigi is buying the pipe requires the length in feet and inches. \n\nHelp Mario work out what is the maximum possible length of pipe in feet and inches that Luigi can buy from the store so they can move the pipe around the corner, assuming the world is 2D (it's an old-school Mario world!) \n\nThe length must be returned in a sentence that Mario can message to Luigi (e.g. '31 feet and 7 inches'). When converting to feet and/or inches, please round down to the nearest integer.\n\nFor conversion purposes please work on the basis of:\n1cm = 0.0328084 feet\n1cm = 0.393701 inches\n",
