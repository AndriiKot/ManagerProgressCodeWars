    "description": "In this kata you will have to determine if the invested energy is worth it or not.\n\nYou will receive two arguments: energy_invested, hours\n\nenergy_invested: How much energy you have to invest in the task. Value will be between 1-10\n\nhours: How many hours will it take. Value will be between 1-10\n\nYou should calculate let's say the estimated value of the work by multiplying the energy invested and the hours then divide it by 10 so the value will always be between 0-10 and return as following:\n\nIs it worth it?:\n\n-Value = 0-4 'No'\n\n-Value = 5-7 'Probably'\n\n-Value 8-10 'Yes'\n\nNote: You should always round down to the smaller integer!\n\n",
