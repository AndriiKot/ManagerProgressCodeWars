    "description": "\n# Introduction\n\nYou're on a **camping trip** with your friends, deep in a debate about the best notation for derivatives (*Lagrange's*, of course). Exhausted from the discussion and tired of the great outdoors, you decide to take a solo adventure into the nearby woods.\n\nAs you trudge through ponds and accidentally collide with some rather unfriendly spiky branches, you start to wonder if arguing about the most notable mathematician was such a terrible idea after all. Then, in your wandering, you come across an unusual sight on the forest floor - the **legendary, mystical circle of mushrooms**. Despite a long-forgotten warning not to enter such a place, you throw caution to the wind and step inside.\n\nBut here's where things get weird. Instead of a peaceful forest, you find yourself face-to-face with a being of *indescribable* appearance. It's not thrilled about being woken up, to say the least. \"**Who dares disturb my slumber!**\" it roars. You stand there, speechless and petrified, thinking that you're about to become an otherworldly being's snack for a minor inconvenience.\n\nHowever, the creature surprises you by asking, \"**Give me a single reason why I shouldn't make you my first meal in eons.**\" Panic sets in, and you're not sure what to say to impress such a powerful being. Then, you notice something peculiar - strange markings etched into the creature's body, seemingly attempts to prove the irrationality of non-perfect square integers.\n\nThinking quickly, you offer, \"**Well, I see you're working on proving a particular theorem. While I can't provide the exact proof, I can give you the values of square roots, which might aid your research.**\" This statement seems to sway the being, and it agrees to spare you on one condition - you must provide it with various square root values it asks for.\n\nAs you walk away, *victorious and relieved*, you realize a new challenge: your phone has run out of battery, and you forgot your charger. All you have is your trusty Apple Watch with its basic calculator, limited to the four basic operations. Now, you must fulfill the creature's request with these limited tools, or you'll wish you had accepted your initial fate. Get ready for a mathematical adventure!\n\n# Task\n\nCreate a function ```sqrt```, such that, given a **non negative real number**, namely ```x```, returns the value of it's **square root**, with a **relative error of lesser or equal to 1e-15**.\n\n# Restrictions\n\nYou may not use the following:\n\n- ```import```, as well as ```__import__```\n- ```pow``` and ```**``` operator, as well as ```__pow__``` and ```__rpow__```\n- ```eval```, ```exec```\n- ```get```, ```[``` and ```]```\n\nThe program checks for the presence of the word in the text file, so ```getattr``` and ```getitem``` are banned by proxy\n\n# Examples\n\n```python\nsqrt(0) => 0\nsqrt(0.5772156649015329) => 0.7597471058855919\nsqrt(2) => 1.4142135623730951\nsqrt(3.141592653589793) => 1.7724538509055159\nsqrt(4) => 2.0\n```\n\n# Test Cases\n\nThere will be ```200``` random tests.\n\n- ```100``` testing values from ```0``` to ```10 ** 3```\n- ```100``` testing values from ```10 ** 3``` to ```10 ** 300```\n\nBoth including **integers and non integers**.",
