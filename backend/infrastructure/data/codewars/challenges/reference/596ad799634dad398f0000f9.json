    "description": "*This series is inspired by myjinxin2015's Traing JS series. I decided to make my own version in Python instead as it was only available in JavaScript.*\n\n## Lesson #1\nThis first lesson will teach you about variables. Variables can store information in a program. They can be very easily created using this format.\n``` python\nvariable = value\n```\n\n## Examples\n``` python\nmessage = \"Hello World!\"\nlesson = 1\n```\nIn this case, the variable with the name `message` has a value of `Hello World!` while the variable `lesson` has the value `1`. You may be asking what is the point of the double quotation marks, but that will be covered in Lesson 2.\n\n## Your Mission\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a variable called `name` with the value being your name, in quotation marks, and tha variable `age` with your age as a number, with no quotation marks.",
