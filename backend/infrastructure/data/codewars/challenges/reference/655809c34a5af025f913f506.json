    "description": "Note: See [Mixing integer types - Part 1](https://www.codewars.com/kata/6555245a3974cb9cd6be19f5) first before attempting this kata.\n\nIn part 1, we experimented with adding integers. If the output type couldn't fit the result of the addition, we truncated the output. However, truncating the output can sometimes be a source of error in programs.\n\nIn these problems, we explore how we can return the `Option<T>` type to indicate when the result of our addition isn't able to fit. Try to design any intermediate conversions/calculations to avoid overflow. If overflow were to occur during the final (or any intermediate) conversions/calculations, `Option::None` should be returned.\n\nUseful References:\n  - [std::option](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option)\n  - [checked_add()](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u8.html#method.checked_add)",
