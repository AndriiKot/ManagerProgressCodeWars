    "description": "# Crane Operator\n\nYou are a crane operator, you are given task to shift the stack of the boxes from one stack to another\nBelow is the image of the state of the boxes you have to shift.\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/SqpvH8a.png)\n\n## The crane supports the following commands:\n\n    - Move one position left (does nothing if already at the leftmost position)\n    - Move one position right (does nothing if already at the rightmost position)\n    - Pick up a box from the current stack (does nothing if the crane already has a box)\n    - Drop a box on the current stack (does nothing if the crane doesn't already have a box)\n\nFurther, there is a limit max_hight on the number of boxes on each stack. If a 'drop' command would result in a stack having more than max_hight boxes, the crane ignores this drop command. If the current stack has no boxes, a 'pick up' command is ignored.\n\nYou are given the initial number of boxes in each stack and the sequence of operations performed by the crane. You have to compute the final number of boxes in each stack.\n\n---\n\nYou will be Given a Function CraneOperation :\n\n    CraneOperation(max_height,boxes,operations)\n\n    where :\n        - max_height is the max height of the single stack\n        - boxes is the initial state of the stackes of boxes\n        - opertions is the operation list crane operator has to perform\n\nThe commands are encoded as follows:\n\n    1 : Move left\n    2 : Move right\n    3 : Pick up box\n    4 : Drop box\n    0 : Quit\n\nyour task is to return the string of the last state of the stacks of boxes after exiting the operations\n\n### Example :\n\n#### example 1:\n\n`CraneOperation(4, [3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 0, 1],[3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 4, 0]))`\n\nsuppose the initial configuration is as shown in the figure above, with 7 stacks and H=4. Then, after the following sequence of instructions,\n\n    1. Pick up box\n    2. Move right\n    3. Move right\n    4. Move right\n    5. Move right\n    6. Drop box\n    7. Move left\n    8. Pick up box\n    9. Move left\n    10. Drop box\n\nthe number of boxes in each stack from left to right would be 2,1,3,1,4,0,1.\n\noutput should be :\n\n`2 1 3 1 4 0 1`\n\n#### example 2:\n\n` CraneOpertion(5, [2 ,5 ,2], [3, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1 ,4 ,1 ,1 ,1, 1, 0])`\n\nshould return\n`1 5 2`\n",
