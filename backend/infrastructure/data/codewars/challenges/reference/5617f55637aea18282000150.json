    "description": "Catch Mad Mars Bar Max \n=======================\n\nMad Mars Bar Max has done it again and managed to escape from Nestlecafe prison!! \n\nThe Nestlecafe secret police have managed to intercept a transmission he sent containing his location, and have tasked you with the job of deciphering it. \nHidden in the transmission is the postcode for the street he's laying low in. Credible sources have pinpointed him to London somewhere....find the postcode. \n\nExample transmission\n---------------------\n\n      [84,83,49,69,57,49,55,53,71,49,51,74,50,70]    ====>  \"SE151JF\"\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nClues\n======\n \n1. Upon searching his cell, the guards found papers on unicode numerical values. [Check out MDN - ] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCharCode)\n\n2. Mad Max has attempted to confuse you by adding extra numbers into elements of the array that are divisible by 2 exactly.  \n\n3. Postcodes in London start with either \"S\", \"E\" , \"N\" or \"W\".......Mad Max may have broadcast the array backwards...but you will only know this when you have converted the array and removed the extra elements ;)\n\n---------------------\n\n   ##Return the hidden postcode in string format\n\n\n\n",
