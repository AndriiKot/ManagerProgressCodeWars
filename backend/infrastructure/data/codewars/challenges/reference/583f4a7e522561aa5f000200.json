    "description": "## Relations\nRelations form a foundational topic in Logic, Math and Philosopy.\n\nHere are a few references to understand the importance of relations:\n\n[Objects, properties and relations](https://cas.umkc.edu/philosophy/vade-mecum/2-3.htm)\n\n[Math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation)\n\nThere are many different categories of relations. In this kata we will focus on reflexivity.\n\n\n## Reflexivity\nReflexivity as explained on Stanford:\n>A relation R is reflexive iff,\n>everything bears R to itself.\n>For example, \"being the same height as\" is a reflexive relation: everything is the same height as itself.\n[Stanford](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory/basic-set-theory.html)\n\n### The Model\nIn this exercise we will look at a Model consisting of points and arrows. The points will be given in an array `S`. For example `S = [1,2,3]` and the arrows will be given as a relation `R = [ [1,1], [1,2], [1,3] ]` . What this means is that there are arrows pointing from `1` to itself, from `1` to `2` and from `1` to `3`.\n\nIn the tests every arrow in `R` will always be unique.\n\n### Task\nWhat we want to know is whether the Relation is reflexive. `R` is a reflexive relation if every point in `S` has an arrow pointing from itself to itself\n\n### Examples\nSuppose you have `S` and `R` as in the first example below then this means that you have `3` points where every point has an arrow pointing from itself to itself.\n\nIn the second example the red arrow is missing from the relation `R`, i.e. `[1,1]` is not in `R`. Therefore the relation is not reflexive.\n\n* Example 1:\n  Suppose `S = [1,2,3]`.\n  Let `R` be `[[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]`\n\n  Result: `R` is reflexive, return `true` in the kata.\n\n* Example 2:\n  Suppose `S` = `[1,2]`.\n  Let `R` be `[[1,2],[2,2]]`\n\n  Result: `R` is NOT reflexive, as you can tell point `1` has no arrow pointing from itself to itself, i.e. `[1,1]` is missing in the relation `R`. Return `false` in the kata.",
