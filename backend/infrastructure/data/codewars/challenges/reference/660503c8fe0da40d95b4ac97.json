    "description": "You're in a room with multiple light bulbs, you want to turn them all on.\n\nHowever, there's a catch: Every time you click the switch to turn the current light bulb on, you're reversing the state of the ones in the right position of it (index above the current one)!\nSo one that was previously on is now off and vice versa!\nThen after another switch click they're all back into their initial states (as flipped again).\n\nHaving a hard time to grasp the question?\nHere's an example to visualize it:\n\n[1,0,1] -> index [0] is alright, don't need to increase the clicked switch count\n[1,0,1] -> index [1] bulb is off, click the switch, total times clicked:1, as well as the new std::vector does look like this now: [1,1,0]\n-> index [2] bulb is off as well now, click the switch again, new std::vector:\n[1,1,1]\n== leads us to a result of 2 times clicked in total, meaning: \n[1,0,1] -> 2!",
