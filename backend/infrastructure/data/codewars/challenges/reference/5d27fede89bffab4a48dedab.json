    "description": "I once asked if module boundaries are also security boundaries.  \nMore specifically, is it safe to grant `ReflectPermission(\"suppressAccessChecks\")` to untrusted code that is running in a named module?\n\nAfter some pondering about the problem I found that the answer is no.\nThere is still a way to escape the sandbox with this one additional permission.\n\nYour code is executed in the default java sandbox with one additional `Permission`: `ReflectPermission(\"suppressAccessChecks\")` and put into a named module.\n\nThe goal is to disable the `SecurityManager`.\n\nThe preloaded code is in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/DasBrain/85091d698c0a335d6d5c0a2045211dcf), but it is only needed on codewars.  \nNormally I would use the `java.policy` property and the `--illegal-access=deny` vm option.",
