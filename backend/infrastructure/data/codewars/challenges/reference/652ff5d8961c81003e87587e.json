    "description": "Most computer games shows the player his score while playing. Often this score only rises, but sometimes it also can decline (e.g. when you make a wrong answer in a knowledge game).\n\n## Your task \n\nWrite a class that holds the current score and manages its current value. All methods are given, you just have to fill the placeholders. These are marked as TODO comments.\n\nNegative values as arguments are not allowed for all methods. They should throw an exception in these cases.\n\n## Hint\n\nThe score must not become negative. Instead, it should stay zero.\n",
