In this kata you task is to help an ordinary office worker to calculate how many days are left before the salary.\n\nYou know that payments come twice a month:\n  - on the 9th of the month (salary);\n  - on the 24th of the month (advance).\n\nYou function `howManyDays` gets the day of the month as an argument.\n\nThe output of your function should be a string:\n\n`${N} days left before the ${payment}`,\n\nwhere: \n\n`N` - number of days,\n\n`payment` - string 'salary' or string 'advance' depending on what lies ahead.\n\nIf less than 3 days are left before payment then the output should be: \n`Left just a little bit`.\n\nIf given day is the day of payment, the output should be: \n`Today! Finally!`.\n\nNote: Assume that 31 days in a month.",
