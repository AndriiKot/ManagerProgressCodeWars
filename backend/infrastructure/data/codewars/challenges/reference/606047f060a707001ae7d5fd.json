    "description": "## Description\n\nYour mission is to create a function ```fraction_simplifier()``` that receives a fraction in the format of two parameters: numerator and denominator. Your function should simplify the fraction and return it as a list.\n\nIf the numerator is smaller than the denominator, then it is a proper fraction. Just return a simplified version of it.\n\nIf the numerator is bigger than the denominator, then it is an improper fraction. Convert it to a mixed number (number and a fraction), making sure that it is in its simplest form.\n\nIf the fraction is already in its simplest form, just return the fraction as it is.\n## Input --> Output:\n\n```fraction_simplifier(125, 1000) --> [1, 8]``` one eighth\n\n```fraction_simplifier(325, 10) --> [32, 1, 2]``` thirty-two and a half\n\n```fraction_simplifier(20, 2) --> [10, 1]``` ten\n\n```fraction_simplifier(5, 7) --> [5, 7]``` five sevenths\n\n## Constraints\n\n- 1 <= numerator <= 500\n- 1 <= denominator <= 500\n\nHave a fabulous time coding!",
