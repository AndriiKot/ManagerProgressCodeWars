    "description": "Peter came to Awesome Bank, because he wants to take out a loan for a car. All required documents were created with 2 (or sometimes more) copies, but gust of wind make a huge mess in documents. You need to help Peter to find copies of documents.\n\nYou will receive an array of strings or numbers and you need to find all duplicate documents:\n```javascript\nsolution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]) === [1]\n```\n\nAll duplicate documents should be provided in order of appearance these duplicates (ignoring the order of original documents). For example:\n\n```javascript\nsolution([2, 1, 1, 2, 2]); //Should return [1, 2, 2]. Because 2, 1 are original documents and 1, 2, 2 - are copies\nsolution([3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2]); //Should return [1, 2, 3, 2]. The order of originals - doesn't matter.\n//Documents 3, 2, 1 are originals. And then all documents (skip 4) - are copies: 1, 2, 3, 2 and we should not reorder them.\n```\n\nThere are millions of documents in the Awesome Bank, so try to be as fast as possible. Also, please, note, that bank is closing in 2 seconds!",
