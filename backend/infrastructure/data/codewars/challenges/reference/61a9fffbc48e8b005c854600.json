    "description": "# Story\n\nJoy's calendar is broken and she needs to know the date of Tom's birthday. Joy knows that today, the first day of the year, is Monday. Joy also knows the week number of Tom's birthday, as well as the day of the week that his birthday falls on. So, can you write a function to help Joy know the date to plan the party?\n\n# Task\n\nKnowing that January 1st is a Monday, and given a week number (week), and a day of the week on which the birthday falls (birthday), return a string in the format \"DD-MM\" of the date of the birthday. \n\n# Example\n\nSo, for example, given a week of the birthday, 11, and the day of the birthday, Sunday, you should return \"18-03\".\n\n# Constraints\n\nThe year is always 365 days (no leap years);\nThe number of weeks is always a positive number <= 52;\nWeeks start on a Monday.",
