    "description": "The _Collatz conjecture_ also known as `3*x+1` problem is defined as follows:\n\nGiven a number `n > 0`:\n* If `n` is even, divide it by two.\n* If `n` is odd, triple it and add one.\n\nContinue with these steps until this series will (hopefully 😉) hold with `1`.\n\n#### Example with `n = 3`:\n```\n3   → odd   → 3*3+1\n10  → even  → 10/2\n5   → odd   → 3*5+1\n16  → even  → 16/2\n8   → even  → 8/2\n4   → even  → 4/2\n2   → even  → 2/2\n(1) → hold and count → 7 Numbers!\n```\n\n#### Goal\nPlease return the count of all visited numbers until your algorithm holds with `1`. Be aware to not count the last step to the number `1`.\n\nReferring to the above example, the correct solution is `7`.",
