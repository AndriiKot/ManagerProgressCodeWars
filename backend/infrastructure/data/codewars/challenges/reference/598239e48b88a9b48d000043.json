    "description": "The word bird is a strange animal, it only feeds on words! It likes all kind of words: long, short, in another language, even madeup ones. Its really picky when it comes to what the words entail though, and it only eats words with letters in it. It will reject even the most long delicious word for containing as little as a number or symbol in it. The one exeption is that the word bird doesn't care about air, and will eat a word that contains whitespace, as long as its at least one letter in there! It also doesnt mind upper or lowercase letters, its not case sensitive!\n\nYour job is to help the word bird by making a function that filters out the words containing non-letters (except whitespace). You will be passed an array with strings, and should return an array containing the strings that the word bird likes. \n\n",
