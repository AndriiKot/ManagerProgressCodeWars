    "description": "A member of the codewars community wants to build a very big house in a `n` by `n` forest, but it contains trees scattered everywhere.\nYour job is to determine the side length `x` of the largest *square* house he can build.\n\n### Input\nYou will be given the length of the forest `n` and a 2d array `t` which contains the coordinates of each tree in *one based* indexing.\n\n### Output\nYou will return the side length `x` which is the largest positive integer of a `x` by `x` square that can be contained in the forest that does not contain any of the `t` trees. \n\n\n![image.png](https://i.imgur.com/z4np7uh.png)\nFor example, a forest of `n = 5`, with a tree located at `(2, 4)`. The largest `x` that can be made is `3`. \n\nNote: The largest test will be `5 000 000 <= n <= 10 000 000` and `50 <= t <= 150`. Average solutions will time out.",
