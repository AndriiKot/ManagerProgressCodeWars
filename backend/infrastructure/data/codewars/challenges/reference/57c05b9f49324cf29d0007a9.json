    "description": "You own a delivery company. Different couriers work in different areas.\n\nHaving a number of free couriers available and a number of orders, you want to know how many of them can be delivered.\n\nYou will need to implement *deliver* function\n\n```javascript\nfunction deliver(couriers, orders, canDeliver)\n```\n\nwhere\n\n* couriers   - the number of couriers currently available\n* orders     - the number of orders that need to be delivered\n* canDeliver - which courier can deliver which order. Array of arrays of 2 numbers - courier index and order index\n\nFor example\n\n```javascript\ndeliver(3, 3, [[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[3,2],[3,3]]) -> 3\n```\n\nResult is 3 - give the 1st order to the 2nd courier, the 2nd to the 1st and the 3rd to the 3rd.",
