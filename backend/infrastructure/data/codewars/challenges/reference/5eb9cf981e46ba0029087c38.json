    "description": "## The Story\nThe new King has abolished the old Monetary system. Everyone now must use the new system by Royal Decree. \n\n### Here are the basics of the Decree:\n\n1. At any time the monetary values of the coins in use can change, when this happens everyone must exchange their old coins for the new values. (Note that the king is of course mad, so these coins are not what you may be used to before he came along.)\n\n2. For anything you buy, you must use the minimum number of coins to make exact change. If you can not make exact change, you can not make the purchase.\n\n## Your Task:\nAs the Royal Programmer, you must write a function for all the merchants to know what the minimum number of coins are for a particular purchase value or if there is now solution.\n\nThe function named **exact_change** that takes two parameters, a list of the coin values in use and the amount of the purchase. It should return the minimum number of coins who's sum would exactly equal the purchase or the value 0 if a sale can not be made.\n\nOh, one more thing: The economy depends on this function being fast, so design your code carefully.\n\n## Some examples:\n\nCALL|RESULT|COMMENT\n----|------|-------\n `exact_change([1, 5, 10, 40], 56)` | **4** | *coins used 40, 10, 5, 1*\n `exact_change([100, 5, 10, 40], 56)` | **0** | *no exact change possible*\n `exact_change([27, 25, 13, 10], 40)` | **2** | *coins used 13, 27*\n `exact_change([1, 5, 10, 21, 25], 63)` | **3** | *coins used 21, 21, 21*\n\n\n",
