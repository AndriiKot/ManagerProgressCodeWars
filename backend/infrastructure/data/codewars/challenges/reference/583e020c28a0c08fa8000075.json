    "description": "The bill arrives at your table and you and your friends want to split the bill evenly but taking into account those who drank beer and those who didn't. The drinkers in the group offer to pay 20% more each than the non-drinkers.\n\nWrite a function that takes the ```total``` bill (a positive number), the number of people in your ```group``` and the number of ```drinkers```, and outputs a string of two values: the amount that each of the non-drinkers should pay followed by the amount that each of the drinkers should pay, which should be 20% more. \n\nKeep the values to 2 decimal places.",
