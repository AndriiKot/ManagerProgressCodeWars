    "description": "### Task\nIn a board game, a piece may advance 1-6 tiles forward depending on the number rolled on a six-sided die. If you advance your piece onto the **same tile** as another player's piece, both of you earn a bonus.\n\nCan you reach your friend's tile number in the next roll? Create a function that takes your position `a` and your friend's position `b` and returns a boolean representation of whether  it's possible to earn a bonus on any die roll.\n\n### Examples\n```\n(3, 7) ➞ True\n\n(1, 9) ➞ False\n\n(5, 3) ➞ False\n```\n\n### Notes\n- You cannot move backward (which is why example #3 doesn't work).\n- If you are already on the same tile, return `False`, as you would be advancing away.\n- Expect only positive integer inputs.",
