    "description": "Linda is a gradeschool teacher. She designed a quiz for her students. The students have taken the test and came back with results. Linda would like to know on average how much time her students spent on the test. The test results are stored in an array of time and names like `[HH:MM:SS, Name1],[HH:MM:SS, Name2],[HH:MM:SS, Name3],...]`\n\nWrite a function that inputs the test results and outputs students' average time in the form `HH:MM:SS`\n\n### Example\n```javascript\nspeedTest([[\"10:25:05\", \"Ada\"],[\"20:35:15\", \"Ben\"]]) // => \"15:30:10\"\n```\n\n**Note**: Round the average time up to a full second if needed.\n\n",
