Introduction\n  \n<p>\nWhich JavaScript developer hasn't asked him/her - self why there are no methods to iterate over Strings exactly like you can do with arrays ?!?\nAll the 'splitting' and 'joining' to manipulate Strings, is just producing...\n</p>\n\n- Pissed programmers\n- Wasted time\n- Unneccessary clutter\n- Reduced code readability\n\n## 2. Plan\n  \n<p>\nSoo, why don't we just implement our own String iteration functions ? <br>\nSome higher-level functions you also know from the Array prototype implementation, will already be of enormouse help...\n</p>\n\n#### 2.1 Extend Prototype With\n\n- [ ] **map** &nbsp;&nbsp; **⇾** Applies function argument to every char and returns an array\n- [ ] **filter** **⇾** Keeps chars which fullfill the conditions of the function argument and returns a new string\n- [ ] **reduce** **⇾** Takes function that reduces array from . . .\n  - [ ] **left** &nbsp;**⇾** Starts at the beginning(here: left) and moves to the end so, left ⇾ right\n  - [ ] **right** **⇾** Starts at the end(here: right) and moves to the beginning so, right ⇾ left\n  \n## 3. Goal\n\n- Add the functions specified in 2.1 to the String.prototype\n- Set the prototype functions as non-enumerable\n- Add logic to control wether the 'reduce' function should iterate from left -> right or vice-versa (use 0 for left, 1 for right as arguments)\n- Pass all tests\n\n## 4. Hint\n  \n#### 4.1 Use ADT's As A Means Of Case-Based Flow Control\n<p>\n<q style='font-size:16px;width:460;text-align:justify;'>Algebraic data types are not the same as algebraic structures. What are\nthey? They’re&nbsp;composite data types made out of othertypes. There’s &nbsp;two\nmain kinds of algebraic data types: Sum types and Product types. Together,\nthey’re like a dynamic duo for encoding business logic.They help us make\ngood things possible, and badthings impossible.</q>\n</p>\n\n## 5. Outroduction\n  \n<p>\n<b>My neurons start firing slowly but surely, and the task becomes vivid . . .</b>\n  \n. . . something like a flow-control . . . hmm . . .<br>\n. . . that could be of use in . . . hmmn . . .<br>\n. . . somewhere . . .<br>\n. . . I forgot . . . hmm . . .<br>\n</p>\n  \n<br>\n  \n**I'm sure you will figure it out ;)**\n",
