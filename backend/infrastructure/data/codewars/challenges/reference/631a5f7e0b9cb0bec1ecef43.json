    "description": "# Finding the Path\nIt is still path finding, but now you need to find that if there is a path __long enough__.\n\nIn this Kata, a `map` is a `10 x 10` square.\n\nYour movement should follow the rules:\n* You can move in 4 directions: `up/down/left/right`.\n* There are some `blocks` on it, they will block your way.\n* You _cannot_ pass the same place more than once.\n\n___\n# Task\nYou will get a `map(a string)`, with 3 symbols : `@`, which  means you will start here; `#`, which means you cannot pass; `.`, which means you can pass it.\n\n30 <= number of `#` <= 40\n\nAnd your task is to find that if there is a path (the length includes `@` and `.`) in the `map` its length is at least `34` (which is `math.ceil(100/3)`), return `True` or `False` accordingly.\n___\n# Example:\nSee the following  examples of `maps`:\n\n```\n         v- start here        v--- start here        v-- start here\n.........@             .......@#.             .......@..\n........##             ........#.             ........##\n........#.             ........#.             ........#.\n........#.             ........#.             ........#.\n########..             ########..             ########..\n..........             ..........             ..........\n..........             ..........             ..........\n..........             ..........             ..........\n..........             ..........             ..........\n..........             ..........             ..........\n```\nObviously, you can find the longest path with length of `34`, `32`, `32` for the above examples as the big rectangle you can go is `8*4` which has `32` points (the arrows just an example, there are many ways to do it).\n```\n34, True               32, False              32, False\n↓←←←←←←←←@             ↓←←←←←←@#.             ↓←←←←←←@..\n→→→→→→→↓##             →→→→→→→↓#.             →→→→→→→↓##\n↓←←←←←←←#.             ↓←←←←←←←#.             ↓←←←←←←←#.\n→→→→→→→→#.             →→→→→→→→#.             →→→→→→→→#.\n########..             ########..             ########..\n..........             ..........             ..........\n..........             ..........             ..........\n..........             ..........             ..........\n..........             ..........             ..........\n..........             ..........             ..........\n```\n",
