    "description": "A small village located on a remote volcanic island has rare botanical items. Many merchants have traveled there but return with only token samples because the local community has a different method of counting. They have no reason to learn the merchant's ways.\n\nA local merchant has aquired an old sea captain's log book and extracted eight translations of quantities in the local dialect. Your task is to reconstruct the information and help the merchant negotiate by using the local dialect for numbers.\n\n\"one, two, three\" was pronounced as \"ses, thif, ethin\"\n\n\"ten\" is \"mur abu thonuth\"\n\n\"fourteen\" is \"mur en thif abu thif\"\n\n\"twenty\" is \"tundor abu thif\"\n\n\"thirty five\" is \"tundor abu mur en thif abu marick\"\n\n\"seventy three\" is \"naf thif abu ses\"\n\n1 ≤ integer ≤ 250",
