    "description": "The King urgently needs to call together his knights. \n\nHis knights certainly have a lot of great qualities, it seems filling out online forms is definitely not one of them. Apart from *Sir John Doe The Detail-oriented*, few knights entered their names correctly.\n\nHere is the \"name\" and attributes of some knights from the `knight_data` array:\n```javascript\n[\n  [\"Sir John Doe the Detail-oriented\",\"detail-oriented\"],\n  [\"Lancelot\",\"brave\"],\n  [\"Sir Percival Robin\",\"wise\"],\n  [\"lionel.bedivere@roundtable.kingdom\",\"great\"]\n  ...\n]\n```\n\nThe correct name of a knight\n\n- should always start with \"Sir\"\n- should always end with \"the\" and the attribute\n- should be a name, not an email address!\n\nSome knights entered their name in the correct format, but:\n- some missed the Sir\n- some missed the attribute\n- some missed both\n- and some knights entered their email address (which is made up of their name). Addresses never include Sir or the attribute\n\nCreate the function `getKnightNames`, which returns an array of the knights' names correctly formatted! \nEach knight has their attributes in the database, and they are all Sirs. Keep the order of the knights.\n\nFor the example above, you should return this array:\n\n\n```javascript\n[\n  \"Sir John Doe the Detail-oriented\",\n  \"Sir Lancelot the Brave\",\n  \"Sir Percival Robin the Wise\",\n  \"Sir Lionel Bedivere the Great\"\n  ...\n]\n```\n\n",
