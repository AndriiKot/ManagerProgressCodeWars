    "description": "1729 is the Hardy–Ramanujan number after a famous anecdote of the British mathematician G. H. Hardy regarding a visit to the hospital to see the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. In Hardy's words:\n\n\"I remember once going to see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. \"No,\" he replied, \"it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.\"\"\n\nThe two different ways are:\n\n`$1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3$`\n\nA Ramanujam number (also called taxicab number) can be written two different ways as the sum of two cubes, i.e., there exist distinct a, b, c, and d such that `$a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3$`.\n\nGiven an integer `n`, `1 <= n <= 1000`, your task is to generate all Ramanujan numbers  where `0 < a, b, c, d <= n`.",
