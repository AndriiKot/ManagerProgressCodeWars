    "description": "### Problem\nYour bank account has a list of transactions ready to be processed. But in addition to **deposits** and **withdrawals**, the list also includes **undos**, indicating cancellation of the preceding transaction(s).\n\nEach will come as a string, e.g. `\"withdraw 100\"` or `\"undo 2\"`, with the action and amount. In the case of deposits and withdrawals, the amount represents money, while with undos it represents the amount of actions to be undone.\n\n### Example\nStarting from a balance of `1000`, we might get a list of `[\"deposit 100\",\"withdraw 500\",\"undo 2\",\"deposit 1000\"]` leading us to \n\n- deposit 100 dollars into the account\n- withdraw 500 dollars from the account\n- never mind, cancel the last two transactions\n- deposit 1000 dollars into the account\n\nfor a final balance of `2000`. In other words, the first two actions go \"on the stack\", then are undone, then the final one survives.\n\nWe will return a string of the format `\"Final balance: $2000\"` unless the amount is negative, in which case we return `\"Final balance: invalid\"`\n\n### Notes\n- undos ignore each other. If we see `\"undo 1\"` followed by `\"undo 1\"`, the second simply reaches farther back, rather than becoming a redo\n- extra undos are harmless. If we've got two actions and the next says `\"undo 3\"`, we undo as many as we can (i.e. all of them) and move on\n- it's okay to dip below zero in the middle, as long as we end up nonnegative\n- inputs are \"safe\" and can be trusted to follow the format, but could be an empty list\n\n",
