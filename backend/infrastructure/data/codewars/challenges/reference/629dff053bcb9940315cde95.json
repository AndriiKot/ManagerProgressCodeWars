    "description": "Greetings, it's Tom, from HQ.\n\nWe have problem. \nAmy, who was in charge of mapping the tasks to their corresponding difficulty no longer works here, as she was found secretly drawing smileys in the restroom.\nIt's a mundane job, but it's gotta be done. \n\nI reckon you could parse the Difficulty from the title of the task with your programming voodoo though. What do you think?\n\n\nThe difficulties always come after \"D:\" in the task title.\nThe following mapping should then be used to determine the final result.\n\n1 - 10 = Easy\n\n11 - 20 = Medium\n\n21 - 30 = Hard\n\n30+ = IMPOSSIBLE\n\nSo the difficulty for the following task would be Medium.\n\n```Firing employees because I can D:12```\n\nAnother thing to note is that the difficulty can appear at any part of the string.\n\n```*** D:20 Decorating the workplace ***```",
