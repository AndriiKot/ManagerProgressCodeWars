    "description": "Harry, Hermione and Ron are playing the most important chess game of their lives.\n\nUnfortunately, things aren't going well for our trio. Ron, having so far made a series of questionable strategic decisions, is aware that the situation is starting to look perilous for white. Black is piling on the pressure and checkmate is looming. Ron realises it's time to make the big move. It's now or never.\n\nAfter some deliberation, Ron takes a deep breath, and finally announces \"Knight to h3\", with the intent of sacrificing himself and his trusty steed, to take home the victory for white.\n\nBut hang on, Ron hasn't given us much confidence in his chess skills so far. Is knight to h3 even a valid move?\n\nYour task is to write a function, knight_to_h3, that answers this question for Ron.\n\nYour function will take as input a list of between 0 and 2 (inclusive) positions, representing the current positions of the white knights on the board.\n\nIf the \"Knight to h3\" move can be made, with at least one of the knights in the given list, your function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.\n\nNote:\n- All input will be valid.\n\n- If the list is empty, this means are no white knights on the board, so the move can't be made.\n\n- If one of the knights already occupies the h3 position, your function should return False.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nknight_to_h3([]) => False\n\nknight_to_h3([\"f4\"]) => True\n\nknight_to_h3([\"f5\"]) => False\n\nknight_to_h3([\"f5\", \"h3\"]) => False\n\nknight_to_h3([\"g1\", \"f2\"]) => True\n```\n",
