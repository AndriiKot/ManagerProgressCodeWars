    "description": "A swimmer wants to cross a river with a flow rate `v_r` [m/s]. \nHe swims with the speed `v_s` [m/s].\n\nThe river has a width of `w_r` [m].\n\nCan you tell him the distance `d` [m] he needs to swim when he crosses the river?\n\nWrite a function that takes the `flow-rate`, the `swim-speed` and the `river-width`. The function should return the distance that the swimmer needs to swim.\n\n**Invalid input values such as negative river width or zero swim speed are not considered.**\n\nHint here is a sketch of the situation:\n```\n                         T Target position of the simmer\n-----------------------------------\n  -->            |      /\n  -->            |     /\n  -->            |    /\n  -->        w_r |   / d\n  -->            |  /\n  -->            | /\n  -->            |/\n-----------------------------------\n                 X Start position of the swimmer\n```",
