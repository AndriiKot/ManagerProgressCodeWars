    "description": "# Colored Token Bag Probability\n\nHi! \n\nThe problem is the following: Assuming a bag filled with tokens made of different colors, tell me the chances I have of randomly grabbing one of a specific color.\n\nYour function `bagProbabilities` has to take a color represented as a `String` and a bag represented as an `Array`, and it must return a `String` with the following format ('D' stands for Digit): \"DD%\" rounded down.\n\nExample: \n\nColor - `\"Red\"`\n\nBag - `[\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Yellow\"]\n\nResult - `\"33%\"` (Not 33.3%, 33.33...%, or 34%!)\n\nSince the result must have a minimum of 2 digits, should the result be 9, the format should be \"09%\".\nShould the result be 100, the format should be \"100%\". Should it be 0, \"00%\".\n\nHave fun!\n\n(I understand that 0.9% is by no means 0%, but for the purposes of this Kata, let's consider that difference negligible.)",
