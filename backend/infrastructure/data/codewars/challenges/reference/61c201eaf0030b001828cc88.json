    "description": "<b><h3>Is the flight safe?</h3>\n\nAt \"Ventoso\" airport you can fly, with small airplanes, to nearby airports.<br>\nUnfortunately, due to the very strong wind in that area, many airplanes are consuming<br>\nmore fuel than expected and do not arrive at their destination.<br>\nWrite a plan that helps you decide whether to take a certain flight<br>\ntransfer (with a certain airplane and the wind forecast that day) is safe.<br>\n\nEach flight is characterized by:\n1) Distance to travel to get to the desired nearest airport (km)\n2) Headwind: km/h (if negative the wind is tail, i.e. favorable)\n3) Airplane cruising speed (km/h)<br>\n   (Remember: actual ground speed can change depending on the wind!)\n4) Hourly consumption: liters per hour\n5) Tank capacity: liters.\n\nPS: for safety it is better to keep the tank on landing with at least 10% of the fuel\n\n<b>You will need to determine whether you will arrive safely at your destination \n(return 1) or run out of fuel first (return 0).</b>\n\n<pre>\n//               1)        2)        3)         4)                5)\nbool flight (int dist, int wind, int speed, int consumption, int tank)\n{\n    // return false or true\n} ",
