    "description": "In Japanese tradition, the beginning of the reign of a new emperor marks a new era in the calendar. For example, in 1868 according to the Western calendar, when Emperor Meiji began his reign, the calendar year was known as Meiji 1. 1869 would be Meiji 2, 1870 would be Meiji 3, etc, etc. When Emperor Taisho ascended to the throne in 1912, that year was known as Taisho 1, 1913 was Taisho 2, etc. \n\nThe task in this exercise is to create a function that can recognise its input as either a Japanese calendar year or a Western calendar year, and convert it to its corresponding year in the other system.\n\nFor reference:\nThe Meiji Era was from 1868 - 1911.\nThe Taisho Era was from 1912 - 1925.\nThe Showa Era was from 1926 -1989.\nThe Heisei Era was from 1989 until the present day.\n\nFor simplicity the earliest possible date will be 1868, or Meiji 1. \n\nWhen a Western calendar year is returned, it must be an integer, and when the Japanese calendar year is returned, it must be a string.\n\nExamples: \n\n\"Showa 5\" should return 1930.\n1870 should return \"Meiji 3\".\nIf the user inputs a incomplete Japanese year, or an empty string, the result should return false.\nIf the user inputs an invalid number, the result should return false.",
