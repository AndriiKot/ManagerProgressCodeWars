    "description": "We want to design a program for number encoding. Given a number, it transforms the number as following:\n\n* it must take **each digit** and add an **increment value**.\n* The new number is encoded using the new digits in reverse order.\n\nFor example, given the number **234** and an increment of **5**, the  new  number  would  be  encoded  as  **987**. \n\nIt  must  be  taken  into  account  that  if  adding  the increment  the  resulting  number  is  greater  than  9,  it  will  have  to  be  transformed  into  its corresponding one digit number: number 10 becomes 1, 11 becomes 2 and so on. \n\nFor example, given  the  number  258,  and  an  increment  of  6,  the  encoded  number  would  be  528. \n\n**Design a module that takes as an input a natural number and a certain increment value. It must return the encoded number.** The increment number is an integer number between 0 and 9 (it is not necessary to validate it).",
