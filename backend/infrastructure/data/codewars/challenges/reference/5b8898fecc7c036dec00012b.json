    "description": "Dwight and Mos, having finished a very successful crop season now have to pack away all the beats - but Shrutes only use packs of 3, 5 or 7. Dwight needs a way to figure out if the beets can be packed away with none left over and leaves it up to Mos with a near infinite supply of 3, 5 and 7 size packs.\n\nHowever Mos misunderstands Dwight and thinks he has to make random pack sizes out of the 3, 5 and 7 size packs then then see if *those* three pack sizes it is possible to pack up the beets with no left overs. Can you help Mos figure out his beet packing predicament?\n\nEx :\n\nMos makes up packs of 11, 19 and 23 he can't then evenly pack up 25 beets. \n\npacked 11 19 23 25 -- False\n\n\npacked 11 19 23 46 -- True\n\nNote they can have a lot of beets and all inputs will be positive non-zero ints.",
