    "description": "# Problem: Reverse Every K Nodes in a Linked List\n# Input:\n1. A singly linked list: This is a type of linked list where each node points to the next node in the sequence. Each node is an object that contains two properties: data and next. The data property holds the value of the node, and the next property points to the next node in the sequence. An example of a singly linked list is {data: 1, next: {data: 2, next: {data: 3, next: null}}}. In this example, each object represents a node in the linked list, and the next property represents the pointer from one node to the next. The null at the end signifies the end of the list.\n```\nfunction Node(data) {\n    this.data = data;\n    this.next = null;\n}\n```\nWith this Node function, you can create a linked list like this: new Node(1, new Node(2, new Node(3)))\n2. An integer k: This is the number of nodes to reverse at a time in the linked list.\n\n# Output:\nA singly linked list where every k nodes have been reversed. If the number of nodes in the linked list is not a multiple of k, then the remaining nodes are also reversed.\n\n# Functionality:\nWrite a function in JavaScript that takes a singly linked list and an integer k as input, and returns a new linked list that is the result of reversing every k nodes in the input linked list.\n\n# Example:\nIf the input linked list is\n```{data: 1, next: {data: 2, next: {data: 3, next: null}}} and k = 2, the output should be {data: 2, next: {data: 1, next: null}}```\nHere, the first two nodes\n```{data: 1, next: {data: 2, next: null}}```\nare reversed to become\n```{data: 2, next: {data: 1, next: null}}```\n\n# Note:\nThe linked list does not necessarily need to be constructed from a Node class. Any recursive object construct with data and next properties will suffice. The example tests will reflect this.\n- k will always be positive and greater than 0.\n- head will never be null so don't mind it.",
