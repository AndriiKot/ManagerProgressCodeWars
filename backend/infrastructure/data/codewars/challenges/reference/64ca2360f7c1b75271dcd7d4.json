    "description": "There is a list of sets with integers, these sets may have common elements (it may be that one set is a subset of the second). It is necessary to compose all possible variations of the combined sets, and you can combine sets for variation only if they have common elements.\n\n#### Input data:\nArray with sets of numbers.\n\n#### Output data:\nAn array with merged sets.\n\n## Example\n#### Input data:\n```\n[{1, 2, 3}, {3, 7}, {7, 8 ,9}, {15, 16, 17}, {1, 2}, {1}]\n```\nAs we can see, the first and second sets have a common element 3, so we write down their union. Also, the second and third sets have a common element 7, we write down their union. The first three sets have common elements, we write down their union. The 5 and 6 sets have a common element 1; 5 and 1 sets have a common elements {1, 2}.\n\n#### Output data:\n```\n[{1, 2, 3, 7}, {3, 7, 8 ,9}, {1, 2, 3, 7, 8 ,9}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2}]\n```",
