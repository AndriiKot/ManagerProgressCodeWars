    "description": "# House\n\nWrite a program that outputs the nursery rhyme 'This is the House that Jack Built'.\n\n> [The] process of placing a phrase of clause within another phrase of\n> clause is called embedding. It is through the processes of recursion\n> and embedding that we are able to take a finite number of forms (words\n> and phrases) and construct an infinite number of expressions.\n> Furthermore, embedding also allows us to construct an infinitely long\n> structure, in theory anyway.\n\nThe nursery rhyme reads as follows:\n\n```\nThis is the house that Jack built.\n\nThis is the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.\n\nThis is the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.\n\nThis is the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.\n\nThis is the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.\n\nThis is the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.\n\nThis is the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.\n\nThis is the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.\n\nThis is the priest all shaven and shorn\nthat married the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.\n\nThis is the rooster that crowed in the morn\nthat woke the priest all shaven and shorn\nthat married the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.\n\nThis is the farmer sowing his corn\nthat kept the rooster that crowed in the morn\nthat woke the priest all shaven and shorn\nthat married the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.\n\nThis is the horse and the hound and the horn\nthat belonged to the farmer sowing his corn\nthat kept the rooster that crowed in the morn\nthat woke the priest all shaven and shorn\nthat married the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed the dog\nthat worried the cat\nthat killed the rat\nthat ate the malt\nthat lay in the house that Jack built.\n```\n\nYou are expected to create 2 functions `rhyme` and `verse`.\n\n`rhyme` will return the whole song as above, while `verse` will return a particular verse of the song.\n`verse` will take a verse_no as the parameter\n\n\nAn example:\n\n``` python\n>>> verse(3)\n'This is the cat\\n'\\\n'that killed the rat\\n'\\\n'that ate the malt\\n'\\\n'that lay in the house that Jack built.'\n```\n\n``` python\n>>> verse(2)\n'This is the rat\\n'\\\n'that ate the malt\\n'\\\n'that lay in the house that Jack built.'\n```\n",
