    "description": "Write a function `longest_sequence` that takes in an array and value as arguments. Return the length of the longest sequence of the value in the array as an integer. \n\nFor example, if the array was `[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]` and the value to check was 1, then you would return 3.\n\nThere does not need to be a strict longest sequence, if two sequences are tied, return one of their lengths. If the value doesn't occur in the array, return 0.",
