    "description": "The mathematician Vanya travels by bus very often. For all the time of his trips, he calculated that the probability that during the passage of one stop the controllers will check his ticket is 1%. If he does not have a ticket, then he will have to pay the cost of the ticket and penalty. Vanya thought, but maybe according to probability theory, on average  it would be more profitable not to buy a ticket and ride like a hare?\n\nHelp Vanya figure out what is more profitable for each particular trip if he know sum of ```penalty```, cost of ```ticket``` and number of ```stops```.\n\n\nIf you ride very often and on average it would be more profitable not to pay for a ticket, we display ```steal a ride```, otherwise ```buy a ticket```\n\nIf there is no difference, then it is better to buy a ticket. \n\nAll parameters are numbers greater than zero.
