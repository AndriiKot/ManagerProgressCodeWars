    "description": "So this is a more mathmatical quistion ,imagine a series of numbers (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8...)\neach number is a square , for example: <br>\ncheck this linkto see the squares - https://imgur.com/uTIhmRN <br>\nn=1-  this square has 4 different lines of one dash.<br>\n \nn=2- this is a square that contains of 12 different lines that each line is one dash , and 6 different lines that are 2 dashes , so this square contains 18 different lines.\n<br>\n\nn=3- this square contains of 24 different lines that each line is one dash ,and 16 different line that is the length of 2 dashes, for example :this\" - - - \"contains two different lines of two dashes ( <__ ->) <br> or (<- __>),and the square contains 8 different lines of four dashes, so it contains 48 different lines. <br>\n\nn=4 has 100 different lines. <br>\nwrite a function that gets an \"n\" - a number abd returns how much different lines there is in this square(n).\n",
