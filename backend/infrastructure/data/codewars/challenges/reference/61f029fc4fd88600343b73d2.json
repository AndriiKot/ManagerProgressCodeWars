    "description": "Hangman is a pen-and-paper game where one player thinks of a word and the other players take turns guessing letters from the word. \n\nIf the letter guessed is contained within the word, the letter is revealed, if not, player 1 draws a body part of the prisoner hanging from the executioner's noose. A bit gruesome for a children's game!\n\nYou will write a function hangman(word, guesses) that takes in a word and a sequence of letters and return True or False whether the guesser wins the game.\n\nguesses will not contain duplicate sequences of letters, and the prisoner is fully drawn after 6 guesses (head, torso, two arms, two legs).\n\nIf there aren't enough guesses to win the game, this should be interpreted as the guesser giving up and should return a False.\n\nGood Luck!",
