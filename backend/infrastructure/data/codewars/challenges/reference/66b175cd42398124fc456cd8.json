    "description": "While dividing the online poker pot, we need to determine which player or players have the winning hand.\n\n## Community and hole cards\n\nIn each game of poker, five **community cards** are dealt. These cards are shared among all players. Additionally, each player gets two private **hole cards**. A poker hand consists of exactly five cards. Since each player has seven cards available, they must choose which five cards to use to form their best hand.\n\n## Poker hand categories\n[Poker hands](https://www.unibet.co.uk/polopoly_fs/1.696321.1636533552!/image/1470891313.jpg)\n\nA hand is scored based on its category. There are nine categories ranging from **High Card** to **Straight Flush** (**Royal Flush** is not a category; it's the best variant of a **Straight Flush**).\n\n## Determining the winner\n\nWhen multiple players fall into the same category, look at who has the highest card. The value of a card is based on its rank. Two is the lowest and ace the highest (low aces are valid).\n\nIf multiple players have a card with the same value, look at the second highest card, and so forth.\n\nIn rare cases, the best five cards for multiple players have the exact same values, resulting in a tie (split win).\n\n## Card representation\n\nA card is represented by two characters:\n- First character is the rank: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, t(en), j(ack), q(ueen), k(ing), a(ce)\n- Second character is the suit: c(lubs), d(iamonds), h(earts), s(pades)\n\nExamples:\n\n`2c` two of clubs\n\n`td` ten of diamonds\n\n`qh` queen of hearts\n\n`as` ace of spades\n\n## Player representation\nA player is represented as a string with their 2 hole cards seperated by a space. Example: `'2c td'`\n\nPlayers will be provided as an array of strings. Example of 3 players: `['4s 9s', 'ad jh', '2c ts']`\n\n## Expectation\n\nReturn an array with the indexes of the players holding the best hand.\n",
