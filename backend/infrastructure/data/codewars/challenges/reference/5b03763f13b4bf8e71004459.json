    "description": "The game fizzbuzz was founded in the UK. A group of individuals would gather in a circle and count until a member of the group screwed up. There is a catch, all numbers divisible by 3 would be replaced with the word 'fizz' and all numbers divisible by 5 would be replaced with 'buzz'. Any numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 would be replaced with 'fizzbuzz'.\n\nCreate a function that takes a single parameter (int) and returns the appropriate string for the number in the sequence. (Hint: function must always return a STRING!)\n\nFor Example:\nfizzBuzz(1)  # Your function should return...\n'1'\nfizzBuzz(3)  # Your function should return...\n'fizz'\nfizzBuzz(5)  # Your function should return...\n'buzz'\nfizzBuzz(15)  # Your function should return...\n'fizzbuzz'",
