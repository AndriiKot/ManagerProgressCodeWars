    "description": "The search function takes two arguments. First one (text) is a string that should be searched. The second one (searchValue) is a string which will used for searching in first argument (text).\n\nThe searchValue string could have 'OR', 'AND' and '()'. 'AND' and 'OR' are used to indicate search conditions. Parentheses are used to prioritised logical operators. \nLet's have look at some examples for searchValue:\n\n```javascript\n\"book AND pen AND big fish\"\n\"(red OR green) AND (blue OR black)\"\n\"red OR green AND (blue OR black)\"\n```\nThe search function return true if the text has query conditions. look at test cases for more clarifications.\n\nPlease note the following:\n\n1. If searchValue is empty function should return true.\n2. The parentheses is searchValue are paired properly.\n3. Any sequence of words that are separated by space(s) instead of \"AND\" or \"OR\" (for example \"big fish\") should be considered as exact phrases (the function should search for exact occurrences of those phrases)\n4. The operators precedence follows the conventions in JavaScript (For more complex kata could be changed)\n\n\n\n\n",
