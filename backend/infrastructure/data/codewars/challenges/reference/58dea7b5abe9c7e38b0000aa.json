    "description": "It seems apparent that [adding numbers as strings](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-strings-as-numbers) is pretty easy, so adding 3 more quadrants to worry about must be just as easy, right?\n\nWelcome to this kata.\n\nGiven number strings `a` and `b`, evaluate `a+b`, and return the sum as a string. But there is now a twist: `a`, `b` and your result can all be **negative numbers**, and you need to handle them properly. Negative number strings are represented by a string of numbers with a minus sign `'-'` appended to it.\n\nAs usual:\n\n- `a` and `b` can be very large\n- `a` and `b` will not have leading 0s, and your result should not have leading 0s either\n- `require` is disabled. Do it yourself ;-)\n\np.s This goes without saying, but you should really finish the 'Sum strings as numbers' kata first.",
