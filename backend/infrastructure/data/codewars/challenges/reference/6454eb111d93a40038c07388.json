    "description": "In this task, you need to use `NumPy` and `scikit-learn` to build a simple linear regression model to predict the price of a house based on its size in square meters. We are using datasets of houses with their corresponding sizes and prices to train the model, and then test the model by predicting the price of a new house with a given size. \nIn the task you need to: \n\n* Convert the input data to NumPy arrays suitable for `scikit-learn`\n* Create a linear regression model\n* Fit the model to the data\n* Predict the price of a new house with the given size\n* Return predicted value rounded to the nearest integer.\n\n##### Notes: \n\n* using `NumPy` arrays is important because `scikit-learn` is designed to work with NumPy arrays as input data. In `scikit-learn`, the input data for machine learning models is typically represented as a two-dimensional array of features (often denoted as `X`) and a one-dimensional array of target variables (often denoted as `y`). The two-dimensional array `X` should have a shape of (`n_samples`, `n_features`), where `n_samples` is the number of samples (i.e., the number of examples in our dataset) and `n_features` is the number of features (i.e., the number of input variables for each example). In our house price prediction task, the input data would be a two-dimensional array of size (10, 1) (since we have 10 examples and 1 feature, i.e., house size) and a one-dimensional array of size (10) representing the target variable (i.e., house price) for each example.\n\n\n\n\n",
