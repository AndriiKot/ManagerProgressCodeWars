    "description": "# Story\nYou are working as sales person, travelling around the world, visiting your customers. Every your jurney starts and ends in the office in London and you are not allowed to come back to office until you visited all customers on the schedule you have got from your boss. Your boss will give you coordinates for each cusotmer before you leave the office. You must claim travel expences before you start jurney, fixed cost £500 for any jurney + £10 per each mile.\n\nYour customers may be on a ship in middle of the ocean or in middle of desert or rainforest, in one of largest cities or smallest villages, in any country in the world. Actually anywhere on the Earth.  \n\nBecause you boss has strange sence of humour, he sometimes gives you coordinates which does not exist on the Earth. You need to check all coordinate before you start to travel. If you miss this catch and start your jurney, your boss will not pay any travel expences, but worst, you will loose this kata. If you spot it before the travel, you can claim extra fully paid holiday day and you are winning this kata.  \n\nSo to summarise, there are two way to win this kata - if your boss tries to catch you and you spot it, you are winning or if you boss gives you correct coordinates and you claim right expences, you are winning. Otherwise you are loosing, but do not worry, you can try again.\n\nThis kata will be created in 3 difficulty levels. Please see below brief descritpion for each level, before going to details of this kata.\n\n#### Simple Level -> this kata\nIn Simple level, you will only visit exactly 2 customers, so you do not need to worry about optimisation of your jurney, as order of visits does not matter. This kata will warm you up for next levels, so you can practice data validation and distance calculation. You are expected to multiply total distance by milage rate. Do not forget to add your fixed costs.\n\n#### Optimal solution -> comming soon\nIn Medium level, you will have to visit exactly 4 customers. You can apply your learning from Simple level, so should be familiar with validating data and calculating distance, but now, you will need to focus on optimal solution. With 4 customers, you have 24 options how to combine them, but your boss will only pay the shortest / the cheapest jurney. \n\n#### Nearest Neighbour Algorithm -> comming soon\nIn Advanced level, you have have to visit between 5 and 50 customers. You should be very familiar with validating data from your boss and calculating distance. Unfortunately, you will not be able to use the same approach as in Medium level. Even your boss understand, that you will not be able to plan the jurney the most cost effective way, because if you have 50 customers, you have ```3.0414093 * 10^64``` options to compare. Instead, your boss expect you to use Nearest Neighbour Algorithm. You can read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbour_algorithm. \n<br>\n<br>\n# Detailed instructions for Simple Level\nNow, you know the story and brief description of your task. Below are details.  \nYour office is in London, England on with these coordinates:\n```\nOFFICE = {\"lat\": 51.49984, \"long\": -0.124663}\n```\nYour boss gives you with 2 customers to visit in the following format:\n```\ncustomers = [{\"lat\": 52.4862, \"long\": -1.8904}, {\"lat\": 55.8642, \"long\": -4.2518}]\n```\n\nRemember, all distances needs to be in ```miles```, you needs to claim ```£10 per miles``` and fixed expence  ```£500```\n\n\n## To solve this kata sucessfully, please follow these steps:\n\n#### 1. Input Validation\nYour first task is to check, if your boss gave you coordinates, or made a joke of you.  \nAny coordinates outside this range are invalid:  \nValid ```latitude``` must be between -90 and 90  \nValid ```longitude``` must be between -180 and 180\n\nIf input is valid, you have accurate information from your boss, so can proceed to next step. If the input is invalid return ```\"I am claiming extra holiday!\"``` since your boss is making joke at your expense.\n\n#### 2. Calculate distance from origin to each of two customers and distance between both customers  \nTo calculate distance, use ```Haversine formula```, with ```EARTH_RADIUS = 3959```, due to working in ```miles```. Just do not forget to come back to your office at the end of jurney.\n\n#### 3. Calculate your expences  \nYou are not expected to round decimal numbers and your boss is so good to you, that he accepts ```£1``` tolerance between your calculation and his expectation.\n\n## Examples\n\nInput 1:\n```\ncustomers = [{\"lat\": 91.4862, \"long\": -1.8904}, {\"lat\": 55.8642, \"long\": -4.2518}]\n```\nOutput 1:\n```\n\"I am claiming extra holiday!\"\n```\nInput 2:\n```\ncustomers = [{\"lat\": 52.4862, \"long\": -1.8904}, {\"lat\": 55.8642, \"long\": -4.2518}]\n```\nOutput 2:\n```\n7490\n```\n\n\n",
