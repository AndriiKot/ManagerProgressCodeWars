    "description": "The World Cup is near, and you and your friends are running a small competition where you try to guess the results of each soccer match. Depending on how close you were to the actual result, you get some amount of points. Your job is to write a program which calculates the points of every person automatically.\n\nThe scoring rules are as follow.\nIf you guess:\n  - The exact result of the match: 3 points\n  - The winner of the match (or tie) but not the exact result: 1 point\n  - The result but not the winner (like \"2 - 1\" instead of \"1 - 2\"): 1 point\n  - (extra) The amount of goals of ONLY one team: +0.5 points\n\nFor example:\n```\n  Predictions: [\"1 - 2\", \"1 - 3\", \"2 - 1\", \"0 - 3\", \"3 - 1\"]\n  Match Result: [\"1 - 2\"]\n  \n  returns [3, 1.5, 1, 1, 0]\n```\n\nAll predictions and match results will be formatted as `\"a - b\"`.",
