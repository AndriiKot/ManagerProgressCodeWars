    "description": "Bobby the bearded dragon wants to buy a Christmas tree. He is picky about how he wants to decorate the tree. The first row will be the star. The next row will have 2 ornaments. The next will have 3 and so on: each row should have one more ornament than the previous row. Every row is 7 inches tall. Any ornaments that Bobby has left over are kept in his storage. Bobby wants a tree the right size for the number of ornaments he has. \n\nGiven that Bobby has an input number n of ornaments, output how tall in inches Bobby’s Christmas tree should be.\n\n**Example input:** `23`\n\n**Example output:** `42`\n\n**Explanation:** 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21, which is the greatest number below 23. This is 6 numbers, so there are 6 rows. Each row is 7 inches, so 7 * 6 = 42. \n\nThe range for inputs in test cases are: any positive integer (including 0) less than 100 million. \n",
