    "description": "### Summary\n\nBob has a list of words in the plural for a new thesaurus project he's been working on. The manager asked him to get the words in the singular, too, but Bob is having a hard time fixing the staging environment right now, so he asked you for help, on manager's consent.\n\nGiven a list of words in the plural, obtain the corresponding list in the singular. \n\n### Attention\n\nThere are two kinds of plural words in the lists: the ones ending with a single `s`, like `cars`, and the ones ending with `es`, like `dishes`. You may have to find a way to remove the ending accordingly.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's say that the input is:\n\n`{ \"cars\", \"books\", \"forests\", \"dishes\", \"animals\" }`\n\nYour goal is to obtain the following output:\n\n`{ \"car\", \"book\", \"forest\", \"dish\", \"animal\" }`\n",
