    "description": "<p align=\"center\"><font size=5><b>Play game Series #12:<br>Number Maze<br><font size=3></b></font></p>\n\n# Welcome\n\nIn this kata, we'll playing with an Android game `Number Maze `.\n\n![](https://files.gitter.im/myjinxin2015/Q8P7/blob)\n\n# Basic Rule\n\nYou are given a `maze`. It's a `n x n` matrix. \n\nThe goal of game is to fill in the numbers from `1 to N(N=n*n)` in the maze, and let every two adjacent numbers be neighbors(in 8 directions). \n\n![](https://files.gitter.im/myjinxin2015/Bmsz/blob)\n\nAs you can see, there are some initial numbers in the maze. These numbers can not be changed. You need to find a valid solution based on these numbers. Like this:\n\n![](https://files.gitter.im/myjinxin2015/F6k4/blob)\n\n\n# Input\n\n- `maze`: 2D array of integer. The game map. The shape of maze is always be a square of `n x n`(3 <= n <= 10). In the maze, `0` means the empty grids, and other numbers mean the initial numbers.\n\n# Output\n\n2D array of integer. A valid solution of the maze.\n\n\n# Note\n\n- All inputs are valid.\n\n- All testcases have at least one valid solution.\n\n- The number you need to fill in is from 1, not 0. That is, for a `3 x 3` maze, you need to fill in `1 to 9`, not `0 to 8` or `0 to 9`.\n\n- Please pay attention to the performance of your code.\n\n- You can search this game on web, download it and play(But I don't what's  the English name of this game, sorry). But, I bet you can't pass the game before you write the correct solution for this Kata. ;-)\n\n\n# Play Games series:\n  - [Play Tetris : Shape anastomosis](http://www.codewars.com/kata/56c85eebfd8fc02551000281)\n  - [Play FlappyBird : Advance Bravely](http://www.codewars.com/kata/play-flappybird-advance-bravely)\n  - [Play PingPong : Precise control](http://www.codewars.com/kata/57542b169a4524d7d9000b68)\n  - [Play PacMan : Devour all](https://www.codewars.com/kata/575c29d5fcee86cb8b000136)\n  - [Play PacMan 2: The way home](https://www.codewars.com/kata/575ed46e23891f67d90000d8)\n  - [Ins and Outs](https://www.codewars.com/kata/576bbb41b1abc47b3900015e)\n  - [Three Dots](https://www.codewars.com/kata/three-dots-play-game-series-number-8)\n  - [Flou](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a93754d0025e98fde000048)\n  - [Switch the Bulb](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a96064cfd57777828000187)\n  - [Calculator: The game](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5aefb889d2ee276a73000063)",
