    "description": "Implement a method that checks if a dependency tree for compiling libraries can be fulfilled without ending in an endless cycle.\n\nExample: if library `a` depends on library `b` for compiling and library `b` depends on library `a`, none of them can be compiled because we are in an endless cycle `a > b > a > b > a ...`\n\nWe can model dependency trees with a hash like:\n```ruby\n{\n  a: :b,\n  b: [:c, :d]\n  c: :d\n}\n```\n\nEach entry represents a library (the key) and one or more libraries it depends on (the value). If a library is not mentioned in the hash, it does not have any dependencies. A library may depend on itself.",
