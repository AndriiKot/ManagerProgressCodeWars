    "description": "### Description\n\nThere are some operations and a sequence. The steps for each operation are as follows:\n\n1. Find the index of the maximum value `i` in the sequence. If there are multiple choices, choose the minimal index.\n2. Decrease the `i`-th value, the `i-1`-th value, and the `i+1`-th value by 1.\n3. Change the negative elements to 0.\n\nWe have `m` modifications to the sequence. You need to calculate the times of the operations apply to the sequence when the all elements in this sequence are zero after every modification.\n\n### Implementation Details\n\nYou should implement the following functions:\n\n```cpp\nvoid initialize(const std::vector<int> &arr); // (1)\nlong long modify(int index, int value); // (2)\n```\n\n(1) The argument `arr` is the sequence. You should initialize things you need there. **Note the index of the first element in this vector is 1, and you should assume that `arr[0]` and `arr[arr.size() + 1]` are equal to 0**.\n\n(2) Modify the `index`-th element to value. It should return the times of the operations apply to the sequence.\n\n### Constraints\n\nEvery element in `arr` is greater than or equal to 0.\n\n`value` >= 0\n\n1 <= `index` <= `arr.size()`\n\n1 <= `arr.size()` <= 100000\n\n1 <= `m` <= 100000\n\nView Test Cases for additional information.\n\n### Examples:\n\nSee Example Test Cases.\n\n### Test Cases:\n\nExample_Test: 2 fixed tests. It's the same as Example Test Cases.\n\nEasy: 2 fixed tests. Every element in `arr` is less than or equal to 100. 1 <= `v` <= 5. 1 <= `arr.size()`, `m` <= 5.\n\nNormal: 3 random tests. 1 <= `arr.size()`, `m` <= 100\n\nHard: 3 random tests. No special properties.",
