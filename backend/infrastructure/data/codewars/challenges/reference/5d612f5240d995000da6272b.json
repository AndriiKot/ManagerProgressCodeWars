    "description": "You are writing web-service for the bank.\n\nThere is an array in your database which contains spendings of the client.\n\n`spending[x]` is the amount of dollar spent on day `x` by the client.\n\nThe client of your bank often makes requests like:\n\n> Tell me how much have I spent in period from day `a` to day `b` (`a <= b`)\n\nYour web service takes array of spendings and array of requests (array of integer pairs)\nand have to return the array of replies to every request.\n\n---\n\n**For example:**\n\n```scala\nspending = [1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 50, 100]\nrequests = [(0, 1), (0, 0), (3, 6)]\n```\n\nThe answer should be: (comments here for explanation)\n\n```scala\nOn period from 0 to 1 you have spent 3 dollars   // spending[0] + spending[1]\nOn period from 0 to 0 you have spent 1 dollar    // spending[0]\nOn period from 3 to 6 you have spent 154 dollars // spending[3] + ... + spending[6]\n```\n\nIf there is no spendings during the period reply should be:\n\n```scala\nThere were no spendings from a to b\n```\n\nYour service has to be fast, cause there are a lot of requests.\n\n---\n\nAlso try to solve:\n\n- [Optimal sort](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5eb1767b3c435d001166d4c6)\n- [Stone pile](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5d49556a8f955d002e58e6eb)",
