    "description": "<b>'OHLC'</b> stands for <b>Open-High-Low-Close</b> and is used in finance to help illustrate the movement of time-series data, typically the trading price of financial instruments. Whilst we will only loosely be using the concept in this Kata, for a more complete explanation please see:\n\n```\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-high-low-close_chart\n```\nFor this Kata you are given the task of creating a function called <b>'generateOHTC'</b> that takes an <b>array</b> of prices as its only argument and returns an <b>object</b> containing 5 arrays: <b>'Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low' and 'Close'</b>.\n\nThe <b>'Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low' and 'Close'</b> calculations will be based on a <b>TRAILING PERIOD OF 3 UNITS.</b> For the sake of simplicity, the 'Date' array only needs to be populated with the index of the original prices array. <b>However,</b> it can only begin when there is enough data to compute the trailing period calculations. Therefore if the input array has a length of 8, the OHLC and Date arrays will have a length of 5. To hopefully make things much clearer...\n\n```\nGiven an array = [2,5,6,3,4,5,9,7,8,6,10]\n\n'Date' =  [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\n'Open' =  [2,5,6,3,4,5,9,7 ]\n'High' =  [6,6,6,5,9,9,9,8 ]\n'Low' =   [2,3,3,3,4,5,7,6 ]\n'Close' = [6,3,4,5,9,7,8,6 ]\n```",
