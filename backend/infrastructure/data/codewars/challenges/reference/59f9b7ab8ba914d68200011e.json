    "description": "As a Games Board Designer, you decide that the future looks a lot like chess!  But, you want to create different board outputs, because chess isn't always going to be 64 squares in a pretty 8 by 8 pattern\n\nYou've also decided that the future does not have to be square!  It could be a rectangle.  (ie, you could have a different number of columns to rows)\n\nTo represent the board layout, you simply have to return a string with a space for a white square and a # for a black square.  The top left square is ALWAYS going to be a white square\n\nMake a function that takes in 2 numbers - the first is columns, the second is rows.\n\n(6,6)\n```\n` # # #\n # # # \n  # # #\n # # #\n  # # #\n # # #\n'\n```\nYour Printers expect the final character to be a new line, so that their systems know when to stop running, so make sure that's there!",
