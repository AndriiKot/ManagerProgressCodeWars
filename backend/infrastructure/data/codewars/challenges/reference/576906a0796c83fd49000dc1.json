    "description": "## Problem\n\nThere is a line of lockers numbered `1` to `N`, initially all closed. A man walks down the line, opens `1`, and then alternately skips and opens each closed locker (i.e. he opens `1`, skips `2`, opens `3`, skips `4`, and so on).\n\nAt the end of the line, he turns around, and walks: opening the first closed locker he reaches, and alternately skips and opens each closed locker. He does this again (walking forward, then backward, then forward, ...), until all the lockers are opened.\n\nReturn a function `LastLocker(N)` that will return the number of the locker opened last.\n\n### Input / Output\n\nInput: Any **positive integer** `N` (no need to check it)  \nOutput: Integer (the last locker)\n\n### Source\n\nShoutout to our professors in maths class for introducing to us this problem. I don't know who actually made this problem (probably from Putnam / local Maths Olympiad), but this actually is fascinating -- for me at least.",
