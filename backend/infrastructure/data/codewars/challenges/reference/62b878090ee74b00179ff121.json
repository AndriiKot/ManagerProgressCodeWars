    "description": "# Decimal Period in Prime Reciprocals #\n\nA reciprocal (or inverse) of a number is 1 divided by the number. For example:\n\n* Reciprocal of 23 = 1/23 = 0.0434782608695652...\n\nThe [decimal period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_number#Relation_to_repeating_decimals) is the repeating part of the decimals of a cyclic number (a number with an infinite number of decimals that have a repeating pattern). Better understood with an example:\n\n* 1/13 = 0.076923076923076923076923076923076923...  = 0.076923 076923 076923 076923 076923 076923 ... \n\n* The decimal period is \"076923\". Its number of digits is 6.\n\n\n\n**Your task is to compute the number of digits in the decimal period of the reciprocal of a given prime (5 < n < 20000).**\n\nNote: you don't need to check if the given number is prime, no tests include non-prime numbers.\n\nWatch this [Numberphile Channel video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmfxIhmGPP4&t=685s) if interested. Your code will be able to accomplish in minutes what an 19th century mathematician took decades to do!\n",
