    "description": "# About Bob\nBob seems to think that he knows a thing or two about security, so he invented a way to encrypt his password in a unique way. He felt so confident in his encryption that he would write down his encrypted password on a post-it note and place it on a desk for everyone to see. That way he didn't have to keep his constantly changing password in memory. Good for Bob.\n\nHis colleagues, however, got sick of Bob bragging about it, and decided to attempt to break Bob's cipher, hoping to have a look at what Bob was hiding on his computer.\n\nOne of Bob's colleagues, Alice, doesn't know much about security, but she heard about CodeWars and decided to ask the warriors to help her crack Bob's password. \n\nAlice wrote down some of Bob's previous password ciphertexts and gave them to you. She also mentioned that in conversations with Bob, he kept bringing up some guy called Caesar and joking about how secret his passwords were.\n\n# Your task\nYou are given a ciphertext and you need to find a way to decrypt it and return the original password.\n\n### Examples:\n```javascript\nsecretCipher(\"xjhwjyufxxbtwi\") => \"password\"\nsecretCipher(\"opnqayopjk1nap\") => \"trustno1\"\nsecretCipher(\"wiTgVeww3Xa0vh\") => \"Passw0rd\"\n```\n\nIf you can't find a way to crack the password, return ```null```.\n\nDo you think you can handle this task? Teach Bob a good lesson about proper password security.\n\nGood luck!\n\n### Note:\nThe description is vague on purpose, this is a puzzle. Do not underestimate Bob, he might have some tricks up his sleeves.\n\n\n##### Sidenote:\nThis is my first kata. **ANY FEEDBACK IS MUCH APPRECIATED!**",
