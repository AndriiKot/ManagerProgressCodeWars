    "description": "Consider an undirected graph with ```n``` nodes and ```m``` edges, which IS NOT connected.\n\nAdd a minimum number of edges to the graph so that it becomes connected.\n\nLet ```extrai``` be the number of newly added edges which are incident with node i, and ```max_extra``` be the biggest out of the values ```extra1, extra2, ..., extraN```.\n\nThe value of ```max_extra``` should be ```minimum```, so be careful to distribute the newly added edges evenly between the existing nodes.\n\nKeep in mind that there are ```MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS``` for how the newly added edges can be placed so the graph becomes connected, but the ```max_extra``` will always remain the same so there are no problems.\n\nYou will have to write the method ```problem(int n, int m, int[] edges)```, where n is the number of nodes, m is the number of edges and edges is an array of length ```2*m``` containing all the edges of the graph, like in the example:\n\n``` Java\nn = 4 ; m = 2; \nedges = {1, 2, 4, 2}\n```\nHere we have a graph with ```4``` nodes and ```2``` edges, the first edge ```1 <-> 2``` and the second one ```4 <-> 2```. KEEP IN MIND THIS IS AN UNDIRECTED GRAPH.\n\nYou will have to return an array of type ```List``` with 2 elements, where the first element is the number of newly added edges of any existing node ```max_extra``` as specified before, and the second element is the total number of newly added edges to the graph which we will call ```total_extra```.\n\nFor the example above, ```problem(...)``` should return ```{1, 1}```.\n\nExplanation: the graph consists of ```2``` connected components ```{1, 2, 4}``` and the isolated node ```{3}```. After adding the new edge ```1 <-> 3``` the graph will become fully connected and we will have the values \n\n``` Java\nextra1 = 1\nextra2 = 0\nextra3 = 1\nextra4 = 0\n```\nSo ```max_extra = 1```, and the number of newly added edges is ```1``` because we only added ```1``` new edge and that is ```1<->3```. \n\nAnother example for better understanding:\n``` Java\nn = 5 nodes\nm = 1 edge\nedges = {3, 4} \n```\n\nAfter calling the method the ```extrai``` should look like this:\n``` Java\nextra1 = 1;\nextra2 = 2;\nextra3 = 1;\nextra4 = 1;\nextra5 = 1;\n```\nFrom the array we can see that ```max_extra = 2``` and ```total_extra = 3``` with one possibility of newly added edges as ```(1 <-> 2), (2 <-> 3), (4 <-> 5)```.\n\n->Keep in mind there are multiple solutions for how the edges can be placed inside the graph therefore your ```extrai``` array may look different, but the values of ```max_extra``` and ```total_extra``` should be the same for any possible solution!\n\nRestrictions:\n``` Java\n1 ≤ n ≤ 100 \n0 ≤ m ≤ n*(n-1)/2 \nThe nodes of the graph are numbered from 1 to n\nThere will not be duplicate edges in the edges array\nFor every edge x <-> y, we have x!=y\n```\n\nGood luck and I hope you enjoy this kata.",
