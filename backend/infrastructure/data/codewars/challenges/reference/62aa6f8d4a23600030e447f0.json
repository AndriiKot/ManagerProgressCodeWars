    "description": "# Bijective binary\n\nA bijective binary number is represented by a string composed only of the digits `1` and `2`.\n\nPositions have the same value as in binary numbers; a string of repeated `1`s has the same value in binary and bijective binary.  \nAs there is no symbol for `0`, it is represented by an empty string.  \nEvery non-negative integer has a unique representation, unlike binary, where `1 = 0001`.\n\nSee also [Wikipedia: Bijective numeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective_numeration).\n\n```javascript\n0 = \"\"\n1 = \"1\"\n2 = \"2\"\n3 = \"11\"\n4 = \"12\"\n5 = \"21\"\n6 = \"22\"\n7 = \"111\"\n```\n\n# Addition\n\nDefine a function to add two numbers, given in bijective binary.  \nOutput a bijective binary number ( as a string ).\n\n# No shortcuts\n\nTo discourage you from working with native decimal numbers instead of bijective binary ones, `BigInt` has been disabled, and random tests will pass numbers that exceed the precision of `Number`.  \nThere will ( doubtlessly ) be shortcuts left open, but you will expose yourself as a cheater, and `$DEITY` may kill a puppy. Don't do it. Think of the puppies!",
