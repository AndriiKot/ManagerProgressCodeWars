    "description": "You're given a dartboard divided into sections, each section has a **unique** score. That means there won't be two sections with the same score.\n\n![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/J8Q9Oxv.png)\n\nThrowing a certain amount of valid darts, find how many solutions there are to reach the target score. Your function will be passed three parameters...\n\n- **Sections**: An array of values for the sections (e.g. `[3, 6, 8, 11, 15, 19, 22]`, the array is already sorted).\n\n- **Darts**: The amount of darts to throw.\n\n- **Target**: The target score.\n\nReturn an empty array if no solution is found, otherwise an array of non-duplicate strings for each solution (e.g. `[\"3-11-18\", \"7-7-18\", \"7-11-14\"]`).\n\n### Examples\nIf there are duplicate values, keep only the one sorted from smallest to biggest.\n\n```\n\"8-19-8\"\n\n\"8-8-19\" <-- This is the one you would keep.\n\n\"19-8-8\"\n```\n\nMultiple solutions should be sorted before returning them.\n\n```\n[\"3-11-18\", \"7-7-18\", \"7-11-14\"] is ok.\n\n[\"7-11-14\", \"7-7-18\", \"3-11-18\"] is not ok.\n```\n\n### Notes\n- Multiple darts **can** land in the same section.\n\n- A dart **must** land in a valid section (it can't miss).",
