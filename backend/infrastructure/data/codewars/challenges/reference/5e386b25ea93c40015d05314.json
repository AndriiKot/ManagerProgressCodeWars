    "description": "The Seven Bridges Problem\n\n\nThis problem was initially solved by Leonhard Euler.  It is considered to be the problem that started graph theory.\n\nRead more at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg\n\nThe general problem can be stated as such.  You have a certain number of land masses(vertices) that are inter-connected by a certain number of bridges (edges).\n\nThe problem is we want to take a walk that crosses all of the bridges once and only once.  Vertices can be visited multiple times.  If the path exists it is called an Euler Walk.  If there is an Euler Walk that has the same starting and ending vertice it is called an Euler Circuit.  Not all Euler Walks make an Euler Circuit.\n\n\nSo, given a list of land masses (vertices). And, a list of bridges (edges).  Return \"Euler Circuit\" if a circuit exists.  If an Euler walk exists, but a circuit does not exist: Return \"Euler Walk\".  If there is no solution: Return \"Walking is for wussies!\"\n\nThe land_masses list will look like ['a','b','c',...] \n\nThe bridge_list will be a list of lists ['ab','ac',...]  Where each pair represents a bridge between those two land masses.  Note: There may be multiple bridges between the same vertices.\n\nNote: Not all of the graphs are fully connected.\n",
