    "description": "*This series is inspired by myjinxin2015's Traing JS series. I decided to make my own version in Python instead as it was only available in JavaScript.*\n\n## Lesson #2\nWe will cover some of the different data types in this lesson. Variables can have different types.\n\nLet's start with integers.\n``` python\ninteger = 123\n```\nThe value of `integer` is `123`, which is a number. It does not need any formatting.\n\nNow, for strings.\n``` python\nstring = \"Hello World!\"\n```\nThis is different. Strings need quotation marks on their sides (either `'` or `\"`). If not, Python would think that it is another variable instead. Look at this case.\n\n``` python\nBob = \"Bob the human\"\nfirstName = \"Bob\"\nlastName = Bob\n```\nThe value of lastName will be `\"Bob the human\"` instead of `\"Bob\"`.\n\nThis is where it may get complicated, with lists. Lists store many items inside, like strings and integers. They can even store lists inside! Each list can hold items of different data types.\n\n``` python\nnames = [\"ngmhprogramming\", \"Bob\"]\nages = [99, \"Unknown\"]\n```\n\nLists must be started with `[` and closed with `]`. Each item must be separated with a `,`.\n\nTrue or False? Booleans have a True or False value. This statement is True. Booleans either have the value of `True` or `False`. If I wanted to store the answer to the question I just asked, I could do\n``` python\nanswer = True\n```\n\n\nLastly, we have a counterpart of lists. They are called dictionaries. They function like dictionaries in real life. Each item has a key and value. The key is used to access the item, while the value is the item itself. A dictionary of names and ages is shown below.\n``` python\npeople = {\"ngmhprogramming\": 99, \"Bob\": \"Unknown\"}\n```\nThe format is that they must start with a `{` and end with a `}`. Each item  must be in `key: value` and separeted from others with a `,`.\n\n## Examples\n``` python\nname = \"ngmhprogramming\"\nage = 99\nnames = [\"ngmhprogramming\", \"Bob\"]\nngmhprogrammingHasALongerName = True\npeople = {\"ngmhprogramming\": 99, \"Bob\": \"Unknown\"}\n```\n\nThese have been explained.\n\n## Your Mission\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a variable called `message` with any string inside, `number` with the type of an integer, `array` being a list, `finished` with either `True` or `False` (check if you are done) and `dictionary` being a dictionary.",
