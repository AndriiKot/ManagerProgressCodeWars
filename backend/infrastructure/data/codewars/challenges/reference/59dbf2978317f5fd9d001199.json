    "description": "# Theory\nPick any number: `n`. If that number is even, divide it by 2. If it's odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Now repeat the process with your new number. If you keep going, you'll eventually end up at 1. Every time.\n\nMathematicians have tried millions of numbers and they've never found a single one that didn't end up at 1 eventually.\n\n# Task\nWrite a function that returns the amount of times the process needs to be repeated untill it ends up at 1.",
