    "description": "In this challenge you will receive an array of unresolved promises which each resolve to a number.\n\nWrite a function called promiseResolver which takes the array of unresolved promises as an argument, and returns a promise which resolves to an array containing the resolved values of the original array of unresolved promises(maintaining the order).\n\nExample pseudo code: \n\n\n\n```js\n// example array of unresolved promises which will be passed in as an argument\n[ Promise { resolve(3) },\n  Promise { resolve(6) },\n  Promise { resolve(9) } ]\n```\n\n\n\n```js\n// The Promise your function will need to return which will be resolved by the tests to check if you \n// properly resolved the original unresolved promises in the correct order\npromiseResolver([promise, promise, promise]) => Promise { resolve([ 3, 6, 9 ]) }\n```\n",
