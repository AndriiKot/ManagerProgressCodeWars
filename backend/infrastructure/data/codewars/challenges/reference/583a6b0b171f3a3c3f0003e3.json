    "description": "Steve's love affair with lava continued. Not only did he [created a lava pool](https://www.codewars.com/kata/583a23d40cf946ec380002c2) in his backyard, he also welcomed lava with open arms into his house. Fireplace with lava? Sounds super energy-efficient! Things were going great until one day...\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/bti7SBJ.png)\n\n\nSteve realized that lava, when handled without care, can indeed cause serious trouble. Below is a side view of the flammable area around a lava block. The orange area represents areas where air could catch flame if the\ngray and orange areas are not clear\nof flammable blocks (for example, wood blocks). The wood in this diagram is all at a safe distance.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/9eeFMEPl.png)\n\nBased on the diagram above, your task is to write a function `isHouseFireproof(arr)` (`is_house_fireproof?(arr)` in Ruby) where arr is a multidimensional array that represents the side view of Steve's house. This function should return a boolean indicating whether the house is fireproof. \n\nan example of arr: \n<pre><code>\n  [\n    [ 'w', 'w', 'w', 0, 0, 0],\n    [  0 ,  0,   0,  0, 0, 0],\n    [ 'w',  0,   0,  0, 0, 0],\n    [ 'w',  1,  'w', 0, 0, 0],\n    [ 'w', 'w', 'w', 'w',0,0]\n  ]\n  \n  There are three possible values: 1 -> lava, 0 -> air, 'w' -> wood (flammable!)\n  </code></pre>\n  \nSome assumptions:\n\n* if the lava block(1) is at, or near the left/right/top edge, you can assume that it's all open air outside of the left/right/top boundry. You only need to check blocks inside the multidimensional array.\n* Since Steve is still pretty crazy about lava, it's possible to have multiple lava blocks in his house ;-) Don't forget common sense here: lava block being too close to another lava block will not burn the house down!\n* Again, only check things inside this side view, don't worry about blocks that's in front of or behind this cross-section.\n  \n  \n---\n*I totally wish I learned about the fire spread caused by lava earlier. I made the mistake of putting wooden roof pretty darn close to lava several times. \n\nTo all the Minecraft players out there: \nfeel free to expand this series or let me know if you have any ideas related to Minecraft that can be turned into codewars puzzles. Some ideas I have that might potentially be turned into katas:\n\n* distance traveled in real world vs. in Nether\n* shortest path problems related to mining diamonds/gold/goodies that appears in different levels under ground\n* growth of animal population from breeding\n* redstone stuff?!\n\nIf you do end up expanding this series, please send me a link of your kata so I can check it out and include a link to your kata here :-)\n\n* [Minecraft Series #1: Steve wants to build a beacon pyramid](https://www.codewars.com/kata/minecraft-series-number-1-steve-wants-to-build-a-beacon-pyramid/ruby)\n* [Minecraft Series #2: Minimum amount of fuel needed to get some iron ingots](https://www.codewars.com/kata/minecraft-series-number-2-minimum-amount-of-fuel-needed-to-get-some-iron-ingots/ruby)\n* [Minecraft Series #3: Lava is amazing! ](https://www.codewars.com/kata/583a23d40cf946ec380002c2)\n",
