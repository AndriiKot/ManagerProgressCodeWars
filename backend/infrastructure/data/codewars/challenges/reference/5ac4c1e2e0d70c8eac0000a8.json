    "description": "Here are the first few terms of a mystery sequence:\n\n> 1</br>\n> 11</br>\n> 21</br>\n> 1211</br>\n> 111221</br>\n> 312211</br>\n\nYour task is to write a code to produce the next term in this sequence. Your function should take in a number <i>n</i> as a string, and output the next term in the sequence as a string, too.\n\nThe sequence doesn't have to start at 1, so the Kata tests include random values of <i>n</i> (all positive integers), and you're expected to give what the next term would be in each case.\n\nPS: part of the fun is trying to discover the mystery of the sequence, so I'll put the connection in a spoiler in the discussion for if you get really stuck...",
