    "description": "The Flash travels around the world at super human speed to save lives. He completes the task multiple times throughout a single day. Since The Flash can travel through time, it is estimated that he can travel faster than the speed of light (671,080,888 MPH). The speed equates to 186,282 miles per second. \n\nObviously, The Flash will encounter obstacles during his heroic duties. It is estimated that he will loose half his speed for two seconds while encountering the obstacle.\n\nDuring the act of saving a life, The Flash's speed will reduce to 1 mile per second to ensure he doesn't obliterate the victim upon approach. He will also spend 3 seconds in the act of saving a life.\n\nGiven a time (provided as an integer in seconds), obstacles encounted, miles he needs to run and lives he needs to save, you must write a function that will return a True or False value if he is able to save all of the lives in the allotted time.\n\nPlease assume that there will always be a life to save, The Flash will always need to travel to complete his tasks and there will always be at least one obstacle in his path.",
