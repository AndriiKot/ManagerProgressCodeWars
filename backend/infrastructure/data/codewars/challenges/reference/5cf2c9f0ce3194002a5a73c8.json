    "description": "The goal is to find write a function `find(n, index)` that finds the permutation of the integers in the range `[0, n)` at a specific index, assuming the permutations are listed in lexicographic order.\n\nFor example, for n = 3, the ordering is:\n\n```\n0: [0, 1, 2]\n1: [0, 2, 1]\n2: [1, 0, 2]\n3: [1, 2, 0]\n4: [2, 0, 1]\n5: [2, 1, 0]\n```\n\nIn other words, permutation `a` comes before `b` if the first differing element of `a` is less than that of `b`.\n\nSo `find(3, 4)` should return `[2, 0, 1]`.\n\nA naive solution to this problem would be as follows:\n\n```ruby\ndef find(n, index)\n  (0...n).to_a.permutation.sort[index]\nend\n```\n\nBut that solution isn't practical for any but the smallest `n`. Your solution will be tested with n as great as 100, and should not time out.",
