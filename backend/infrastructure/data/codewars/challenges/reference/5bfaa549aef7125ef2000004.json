    "description": "Your task is to write function that generate two letters for given integer number. For example:\n```\nletters(42993) -> 'YP'\nletters(537024) -> 'NS'\nletters(132645) -> 'RN'\n```\nThe algorithm is unknown, you have to unveil it yourself form the test data.\n\nTest input will be always positive integers.\n\nIt's not very easy kata, you sould apply some analysis to numbers and letters to solve it.\n\nBut it's not made-up just here, this kata based on reverse engineerig work i did myself, and conditions was the same - lot of numbers and letters.\n",
