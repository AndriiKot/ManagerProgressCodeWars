    "description": "One of the simplest and most widely known `ciphers` is a `Caesar cipher`, also known as a `shift cipher`. In a `shift cipher` the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.\n\nA common modern use is the [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.\n\nWrite a function which takes a [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.\n\nAll letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.\n\nRemember to use [Read-Search-Ask](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck/19514) if you get stuck. Write your own code.\n\nhttps://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/caesars-cipher",
