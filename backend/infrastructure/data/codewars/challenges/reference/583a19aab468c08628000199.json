    "description": "In a game of tennis, a bookmaker will determine the odds of winning for each player.\n\nFor example, Bookmaker 1 estimates that Player 1 has 8/15 chance of winning, and Player 2 has a 17/10 chance of winning. Bookmaker 2 estimates that Player 1 has a 8/15 chance of winning and Player 2 has a 6/4 chance.\n\nWe are interested in getting the best odds for each player from either book maker, converting it into a decimal, then into a percentage. After which we want to total up the percntages of each of the odds identified.\n\nFollowing the example above - Player 1 8/15 = 65% (Bookmaker 1) || Player 2 6/4 = 40% (Bookmaker 2) would be the best odds identified from each bookmaker. 100/(6/4)+1 = 40.\n\nThe total percentage of all the best odds identified (with no decimals) would be 102%.
