    "description": "# Overview\n\nYou are tasked with creating a function that generates an unpredictable sequence of integers. The sequence should have the following properties:\n\n1. The sequence should be infinite.\n2. The difference between consecutive elements in the sequence should not be a constant.\n3. The sequence should not contain any duplicate elements.\n\n# Task\n\nYour goal is to implement the `unpredictable_sequence()` function, which should return the next element in the unpredictable sequence whenever it is called. To ensure that the sequence is truly unpredictable, you should not use any external libraries or modules. The function should return integers starting from 1.\n\n## Hint:\n\nUse `yield` to create a generator for the unpredictable sequence.\n\n* Implement a mathematical function that calculates each element based on the previous one. The function should be designed in a way that it doesn't follow a simple pattern, such as a linear equation.\n\n* Ensure that the rate of change between consecutive elements is not constant. You can achieve this by using functions with varying slopes.\n\n* Create a recursive algorithm that generates each element based on previous values. To ensure unpredictability, design the recursion in such a way that it doesn't follow a clear pattern or relationship.\n\n* Apply non-linear mathematical transformations to the values generated by the generator. This can introduce unpredictability by altering the values in a non-constant manner.",
