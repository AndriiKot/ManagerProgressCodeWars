    "description": "Sean is a guy, who quite frankly, follows his dreams. He is a man that knows what he wants and goes out and gets what he wants. Over the years Sean has heard thousands of people chant his name and now he wants to only hear people chant his name.\n\nDesign a function that given an input string, returns a 'Sean' chant. \n\nCriteria:\n\n1. If the input is not a string, return 'Boo! Not a string, boo!'\n2. If there are fewer than three words return 'Ohhhhh it's Sean!'\n3. For words in the string replace the first word with 'Ohhhhh', the second word with 'it's' and every word after that with either 'Sean!' if the word is not capitalized or 'SEAN!' if it is capitalized or is made entirely of special characters or a special character at the start.\n\nNote: words are classified as strings of any character in between spaces.\n\nExamples:\n\n\"Hello World\" = \"Ohhhhh it's Sean!\"\n\n\"Compare us to the world, the outlier, the doubtfire!\" = \"Ohhhhh it's Sean! Sean! Sean! Sean! Sean! Sean! Sean!\"\n",
