    "description": "Currying is a fundamental tool in functional programming, a programming pattern that tries to minimize the number of changes to a program’s state (known as side effects) by using immutable data and pure (no side effects) functions.\n\nCurrying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and returning a series of functions that take one argument and eventually resolve to a value.\n\nIf you’re confused how the innermost function has access to the variables in outer functions, learn more about closures and scoping in JavaScript.\n\nNow it’s time to write our own curry function, which is a bit tricky. Fortunately ES6’s spread operator and arrow syntax help simplify things.\n\nGiven a function already declared, create a function called `curry` that receives as first parameter the function you want to curry, this function should return the original function curried.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n// Function given to curry\nfunction volume(l, w, h) { return l * w * h } \nvolume(2, 3, 1) // returns 6\n\n// Function curried \nconst volumeCurried = curry(volume)\nvolumeCurried(2)(3)(1) // should returns 6 as well\n```",
