    "description": "In this kata the story of a man and his trip to the hell of programming is summarized. Believing himself lucky to become a TA, he accepted the job with enthusiasm without knowing what a trip to exhaustion would bring.\n\nOn this path our hero will slowly and painfully lose his sanity. Your writing will be irreversibly affected and today's goal is to help your writing regain normality\n\nWhen you write any sentence that contains a combination of laughter, the code may transform it like this : jajajaja => Ja Ja Ja Ja\n\nIf the sentence contains a group of 3 periods, it may transform it like this : .euha.died.jaS => . . . => [<space>.<space>.<space>.<space>]\n\nThe last challenge is a combination of both, if a sentence contains laughter and periods, your code may transform it like this : ja.jaa.je.ewjue => Ja Ja Ja . . .",
