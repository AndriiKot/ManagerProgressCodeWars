    "description": "Collatz conjecture can be summarized as follows. \n\nTake any positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. \n\nThe conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.\n\nWrite code to calculate the number of steps in a sequence to reach 1.\n\nFor example, starting with 12, the following sequence is produced: 12 -> 6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1. The number of steps is 9.",
