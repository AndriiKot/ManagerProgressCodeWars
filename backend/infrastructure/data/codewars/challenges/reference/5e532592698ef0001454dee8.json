    "description": "**Count Max Tries**\n-------------------\nAn introduction into the binary search algorithm is achieved by programming the game \"Find The Number\". The most frequent alternative of the game demands from the student to programm a game where a human or a computer player (primitive AI) must guess a random integer in the range of integers \\[0, 100] (bounds inclusive) using as less tries as possible. \nFor the range of 100 numbers the player or the AI making the wisest selections will need no more than 7 tries to find the secret number. This demands to use the binary search algorithm. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm\nChallenge\n---------\nIn the case where a left bound and a right bound are given; what will be the maximum number of tries a wise player will need to find a random integer out of a range of integers made from these bounds? \n\nThe function will have two parameters: left bound and right bound and must return an integer which will be the tries to find a secret integer in this range. \n\nLimitations\n-----------\n`lbound >=0` and `rbound >=1` and `rbound >= lbound` and `rbound < 239e306`.\n\nA representative difference between `rbound` and `lbound` in the advanced cases can be:\n`12411372525831278467319969701048638785809220990161503737313394499173289237232177043390793658236954653295904754039336594703982945475473349040033723087916516062320469571708919038093576769263851604058482834458224794470221561750020935552370293277001374271333629154017780901195498255476883154664959155392607108252780800697598397114`\n\nExamples\n---------\n\n\\>>> max_tries(lbound=1, rbound=100)\n- out:  7 \n\n\\>>> max_tries(1, 128)\n- out: 7\n\n\\>>> max_tries(1, 129)\n- out: 8\n",
