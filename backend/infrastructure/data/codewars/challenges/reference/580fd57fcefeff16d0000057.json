    "description": "You're queued for lunch at the Hooli cafeteria, eagerly anticipating the special of the day: Organic, grass-fed, free-range chicken breast with a side of kale (mmm).\n\nAll of a sudden, the fire alarm goes off and you all race outside.  Breathing a sigh of relief as you realize it was just a drill, you head back to the cafeteria. As an egalitarian, meritocratic future company (tm), you and your coworkers are committed to restoring the correct order of the line. Problem is, you don't remember your number in line.\n\nWhat you DO know is how many people in front of you were at least as tall as you (f) and your own height (h) in centimeters.\n\nSo your properties will looks something like this, where both n and k are guaranteed to be nonnegative integers.\n```javascript\n{\n  h: 195,\n  f: 3\n}\n```\nGiven a list of employees with such properties, find the correct ordering of the line.  Any employee with f = x should be behind exactly x other employees.\n\n```javascript\n// Given this\nvar unordered = [{h: 200, f: 1}, {h: 185, f: 2}, {h: 190, f: 0}, {h: 175, f: 4}, {h: 190, f: 2}, {h: 200, f: 0}]\n\n// End up with this\nvar ordered = [{h: 190, f: 0}, {h: 200, f: 0}, {h: 185, f: 2}, {h: 190, f: 2}, {h: 175, f: 4}, {h: 200, f: 1}]\n```",
