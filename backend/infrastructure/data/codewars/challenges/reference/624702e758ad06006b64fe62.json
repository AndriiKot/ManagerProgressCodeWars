    "description": "**CURRENTLY ONLY PYTHON**\n\nSquirrel High School has just completed their sports carnival and need someone to help rank the squirrels in each class.\n\nWrite a function `rank_competitors(squirrels)` which takes an argument - dictionary of competitors - and returns a sorted list of squirrels.\n\n```\n{\"Sonya\": (1, 0, 3), \"Sofia\": (0, 3, 0), ...}  # example input dictionary\n```\n\nThe 'squirrels' dictionary will have keys be the names of squirrels, and values be a tuple containing medal counts.\nEach class has squirrels who may have scored gold, silver or bronze medals. Gold medals are worth 3 points, silvers worth 2 points and bronze worth 1 point.\n\nTally up each students' points and return a list that contains the squirrels ranked from most points to least.\nIf there is a tie in points, the competitor with more high value medals should be sorted first.\nIf there is a tie in all medals, sort the squirrels in alphabetical order.\nYou may assume that all medal counts are non-negative.\n\n**Example:**\n```\nSonya: 1 Gold, 0 Silver, 3 Bronze => 6 points\nSofia: 0 Gold, 3 Silver, 0 Bronze => 6 points\n```\n\nFirst compare golds. Sonya has more golds than Sofia, so Sonya is sorted ahead of Sofia. If golds are equal, then compare silvers and so forth.",
