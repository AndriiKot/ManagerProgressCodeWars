    "description": "In computer programming, camel case is often used for variable names, e.g. thisIsMyVariable. Interestingly, some language styles prefer the first letter capitalised, others not.\n\nFor instance, ```ThisIsMyVariable```, with the initial upper case letter, is commonly known as Pascal case. While, ```thisIsMyVariable``` is called a Dromedary case.\n\nIn this short Kata, your task is to count the number of upper case letters in a given camel-cased string, but only if the string is in the Dromedary camel case style.\n\nFor example:\n\nGiven a variable named ```hundredsOfCamels``` the count is ```2```.\n\nHowever, if the string is in Pascal case, e.g. ```HundredsOfCamels```, return ```0```.\n\nOh, and for the sake of simplicity, you don't have to worry about test cases with an empty string.\n\nThat's it. Nice and simple.\n\nHappy coding!",
