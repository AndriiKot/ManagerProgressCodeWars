    "description": "This Kata was created as a part of monthly meetings by\nhttp://www.meetup.com/functional-kats-cork/?rv=wm1 FunctionalKats Cork.\n\nPostfix notation\n\nLogical Boolean expressions are typically written using infix notation, but an alternative called \"postfix notation” exists.\n\nIn infix notation,\n\nbinary operators ```(∧, ∨, ⊕, etc.)``` are placed between their operands;\nthe ```¬``` unary operator is placed before its operand;\nparentheses are used to indicate precedence.\nHere is a Boolean expression written in infix notation:\n\n```(a ∧ b) ∨ ¬ c```\nIt evaluates to true if both a and b are true, or if c is false. By contrast, in postfix notation,\n\nan operator is placed after its operand(s);\nparentheses are not needed.\nHere is the same Boolean expression as above, written in postfix notation:\n\n```a b ∧ c ¬ ∨```\nYour task\n\nWrite a function that takes a string corresponding to a Boolean expression written in postfix notation, parses that expression and evaluates it.\n\nInput\n\nA string corresponding to a Boolean expression written in postfix notation. For the sake of simplicity, you can assume that input strings all correspond to valid Boolean expressions. Each token is separated by a single space character. The possible tokens are\n```\n0 for false,\n1 for true,\nA for AND,\nR for OR,\nX for XOR (exclusive-or),\nN for NOT.````\nOutput\n\ntrue if the expression evaluates to true; false otherwise.\n\nExamples:\n```\nInput                Output\n0 1 R                true\n1 0 A 1 R N N        true\n1 0 A 1 N 0 N A R    false```",
