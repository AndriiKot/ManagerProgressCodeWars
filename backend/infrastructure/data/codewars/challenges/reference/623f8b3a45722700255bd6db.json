    "description": "## What will Agumon digivolve into?\n\n_In this kata, we are going to reproduce part of the digivolution algorithm from [Digimon World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digimon_World)._\n\nWe have an Agumon, and he's about to digivolve! He could become Greymon, Meramon, Birdramon, Centarumon, Monochromon, Tyrannomon, or the game's booby prize, Numemon (let's hope not!).\n\nTo avoid getting the dreaded Numemon, we'll need to have fulfilled at least 3 of the 4 requirements for one of Agumon's champion forms. They work as follows:\n\n* The **stats** requirement is met when a specific set of stats is at or above a threshold. In Agumon's case, the threshold is always 1,000 for HP and 100 for every other stat. To give an example: Tyrannomon's required stats are HP and Defense, so we meet Tyrannomon's stats requirement if Agumon's HP is `>= 1000` and his Defense is `>= 100`.\n* The **care mistakes** requirement is met if Agumon's number of care mistakes is either above or below a certain amount. Greymon requires Agumon's care mistakes to be `<= 1`, while Birdramon requires them to be `>= 3`.\n* The **weight** requirement is met if Agumon's weight is within 5 of a target weight. Greymon has a target weight of 30, so Greymon's weight requirement is met if Agumon's weight is `>= 25` and `<= 35`.\n* The **bonus** requirement is met when a specific condition is true. An example is `Discipline >= 90 OR Techniques >= 35`.\n\nThe details of each champion's requirements are as follows:\n\n| Digimon     | Stats                           | Care Mistakes | Weight | Bonus                                  |\n| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |\n| Greymon     | Offense, Defense, Speed, Brains | `<= 1`        | 30     | `Discipline >= 90 OR Techniques >= 35` |\n| Meramon     | Offense                         | `>= 5`        | 20     | `Battles >= 10 OR Techniques >= 28`    |\n| Birdramon   | Speed                           | `>= 3`        | 20     | `Techniques >= 35`                     |\n| Centarumon  | Brains                          | `<= 3`        | 30     | `Discipline >= 60 OR Techniques >= 28` |\n| Monochromon | HP, Defense, Brains             | `<= 3`        | 40     | `Battles <= 5 OR Techniques >= 35`     |\n| Tyrannomon  | HP, Defense                     | `<= 5`        | 30     | `Battles <= 5 OR Techniques >= 28`     |\n\nIt's possible to fulfill the requirements for more than one champion, so Agumon's new form is decided using scores generated by the following algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a `carryover score` and a `carryover count`, both to `0`.\n2. For each of Agumon's champion forms, in the order listed above (Greymon, Meramon, Birdramon...):\n    1. Determine the score:\n        * If less than 3 of the champion's requirements are met, the score is 0.\n        * Otherwise, the score is `(stat total + carryover score) / (stat count + carryover count)`.\n            * `stat total` is the sum of all of Agumon's values for the stats in the champion's stats requirement. If one of those is HP, only 1/10th of Agumon's HP is used.\n            * `stat count` is the number of stats in the champion's stats requirement.\n            * This calculation uses integer division, so if `(stat total + carryover score)` is 200 and `(stat count + carryover count)` is 3, its result is 66.\n    2. Update the `carryover score` and `carryover count`:\n        * If the score is zero, do nothing.\n        * Otherwise, if the score is higher than any other score so far (or is the first non-zero score), reset both the `carryover score` and `carryover count` to `0`.\n        * Otherwise, set the `carryover score` to the score, and _increment_ the `carryover count` by the champion's `stat count`.\n\nThe champion we get is the one with the highest non-zero score. If multiple champions are tied for first place, we get the one that appears first in the list (so Greymon beats Meramon, Meramon beats Birdramon, etc.). If all the scores are zero, we get Numemon. :(\n\n## The Task\n\nWrite a `digivolve` function that takes an `agumon` object with `hp`, `offense`, `defense`, `speed`, `brains`, `careMistakes`, `weight`, `discipline`, `battles`, and `techniques` properties (all integers). Return an object with a `scores` property containing an array of the scores for all of Agumon's champion forms (in the order they were generated) and a `digimon` property containing the name of Agumon's new form.\n\n## Examples\n\nA simple example where we get Tyrannomon:\n\n```javascript\nconst agumon = {\n  hp: 1000,\n  offense: 50,\n  defense: 100,\n  speed: 50,\n  brains: 50,\n  careMistakes: 0,\n  weight: 30,\n  discipline: 0,\n  battles: 6,\n  techniques: 1\n};\n\n// { scores: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 100], digimon: 'Tyrannomon' }\ndigivolve(agumon);\n```\n\nA more complex example where all champions have at least 3 fulfilled requirements. Despite the stats being even, the scores shrink due to the way the carryover count grows:\n\n```javascript\nconst agumon = {\n  hp: 1000,\n  offense: 100,\n  defense: 100,\n  speed: 100,\n  brains: 100,\n  careMistakes: 0,\n  weight: 20,\n  discipline: 0,\n  battles: 0,\n  techniques: 35\n};\n\n// { scores: [100, 100, 100, 66, 61, 32], digimon: 'Greymon' }\ndigivolve(agumon);\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nI wouldn't have been able to write this kata without [this tool](https://phoenix-staffel.de/digimon/DigimonWorld/evolution.html) and [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aHHXZXjZNDabFTWUdF055M0oshyC57kff5NVc2BTYGE/edit#heading=h.p8o1f4ftpw2a).",
