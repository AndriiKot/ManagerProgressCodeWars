    "description": "When you practice diving, you use tanks having a real volume of 12 liters, containing compressed air at a pressure of 200 bars.\n\n- The average air consumption per minute is 15 liters at the surface level.\n\n- The regulator that allows you to breathe delivers air at ambient pressure.\n\n- The ambiant pressure is the sum of the atmospheric pressure (1 bar) and\nthe relative hydrostatic pressure which increases linearly by one bar every 10 meters.\n\nWrite a function how_long(depth) which computes the number of minutes you can stay at a given depth (in meters) before running out of air.\n\n*In this kata, we do not take into account the time required for the descent and ascent, but only the time spent at a constant given depth.*",
