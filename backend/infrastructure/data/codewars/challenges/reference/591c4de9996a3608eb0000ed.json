    "description": "Consider the following class:\n\n```cs\npublic class Member\n{\n  public string Surname { get; set; } \n  public string FirstName { get; set; }\n  public DateTime MembershipStartDate { get; set; }\n  public int NumberOfDependents { get; set; } \n  public decimal MonthlyPremiumRands { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nWrite a method that accepts a list of ```Member``` objects, and returns a string containing a list of records (one record per line) with fixed-width fields.\n\nFor interest's sake, the program that this method plugs into will write the resulting string to a plain-text file.\n\nThe field widths are as follows:\n```\nSurname: 15 characters\nFirstName: 15 characters\nMembershipStartDate: 8 characters (in the format YYYYMMDD)\nNumberOfDependents: 2 characters (with a leading zero)\nMonthlyPremiumRands: 8 characters (no leading zeroes, no cents)\n```\n\n```MonthlyPremiumRands``` must be right-aligned. All other fields must be left-aligned. \n\n```Surname``` and ```FirstName``` must be converted to uppercase before writing. Furthermore, if either of them are more than 15 characters in length, truncate them to 15 characters.\n\nThe file must include a single space after each field, except the last one, and each record must end with a carriage-return/line-feed combination.\n\nIn other words, the record terminator in your output will be ```\\r\\n```. If there are no records (i.e. no lines), they must not be terminated.\n\nFor example, the record:\n\n```cs\nnew Member\n{\n  Surname = \"Downs\",\n  FirstName = \"Graham\",\n  MembershipStartDate = new DateTime(1998, 1, 1),\n  NumberOfDependents = 1,\n  MonthlyPremiumRands = 5120\n}\n```\n\nshould be written as follows:\n\n```\nDOWNS           GRAHAM          19980101 01     5120\n```\n\nYou may assume that the list will never be ```null```, but it may be empty, in which case you should return an empty string.",
