    "description": "A and B decided to play Texas Hold'em poker.\nSince they are new players, they are often arguing who wins.\n\nHelp them with a program that makes this decision!\nWrite a function that checks their cards and the common cards, and return with 'A' or 'B'.\nIn even cases, return 'AB'!\n\n\nWe don't check colors, the evaluation order is the following:\n```python\n1. Four of a Kind: 'A hand containing four cards of equal rank'\n2. Full House: 'A hand with three cards of one rank and two of a second rank'\n3. Straight: 'Contains five cards of sequential rank'\n4. Three of a Kind: 'Contains three cards of the same rank'\n5. Two pairs: 'Contains two cards of the same rank, plus two cards of another rank'\n6. One pair: 'Contains two cards of the same rank'\n7. Sum of Cards\n```\nYou don't need to filter wrong inputs, and the following characters are used only in input string:\n```python\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A\n```\n\nThe common always have 5 cards, and both A and B have 2-2.\nAlways check the 5 best cards from the 7 cards, as the Texas Holdem rule declares.\n\nGood luck!",
