    "description": "# Regular Polygon Detector\n\n> Our R&D department has developed a new IOT device that captures images of objects passing by.\nThe different surfaces of these images are plotted as 2D drawings; \nAnd these are translated into a list of cartesian coordinates containing the objects outline.\n\n> Your job is to detect if these objects are **regular polygons** by connecting these coordinates with straight lines in order of appearance.\n\n***definition***\n\n> In Euclidean geometry, a regular polygon is a polygon that is: \n> - **equiangular**: all angles are equal in measure, and \n> - **equilateral**: all sides have the same length.  \n>\n> Regular polygons may be either convex or star formed, but in our case we will only have convex polygons.\n\n***examples***\n```elixir\n> Polygon.is_regular([{1,1},{1,-1},{-1,-1},{-1,1}])  \ntrue\n```\n> all sides have length 2  \n> all angles are 90°\n```elixir\n> Polygon.is_regular([{2,1},{2,-1},{-2,-1},{-2,1}])\nfalse\n```\n> all angles are 90°  \n> but NOT all sides have the same length\n\n***input***\n> - list of {x, y} coordinates containing the polygon's corners\n> - at least 3 coordinates are needed to form a valid polygon\n\n```elixir\nList of Tuples\n[{1.0, 1.0},{1.0, -1.0},{-1.0, -1.0},{-1.0, 1.0}]\n```\n\n***output***\n> - return true when the list contains a regular polygon\n> - return false in all other cases (for irregular polygons, polygons with less then 3 coordinates, ...)\n\n***rounding & comparison rules***\n> - tests will use a precision of 6 decimals when comparing floats, to avoid comparison issues round your final calculations also to 6 decimals\n> - when comparing 2 floats rounded as specified in previous rule, a delta of 0.000001 is used:  \n>   - 2 floats will be equal when the difference is less than or equal 0.000001\n>   - 2 floats will NOT be equal when the difference is greater than 0.000001\n\nHave fun!\n",
