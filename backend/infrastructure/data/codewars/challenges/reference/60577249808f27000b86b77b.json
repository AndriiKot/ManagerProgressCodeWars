    "description": "A first bike starts from a city A, going to a city B at a speed of v1 km/h.\n\nAt the same time, a second bike starts from the city B, going to the city A at a speed of v2 km/h.\n\nDistance AB is equal to d km. There is a single road from A to B.\n\nThe instant the two bikes leave, a hummingbird which was posed on the bike starting from A flies towards the second bike at a speed of vf km/h.\n\nWhen the hummingbird has reached the second bike, it comes back to the first, then goes back to the second, and so on until the bikes meet.\n\nYour mission is to write a function fly_distance(d,v1,v2,vf) returning the distance traveled by the hummingbird between its take-off and the meeting of the two bikes.\n\nWe will always have vf>v1 and vf>v2.",
