    "description": "##Debug\nproposed solution for kata. There are 5 logical errors in the proposed solution..\n\n\nIf we were to set up a Tic-Tac-Toe game, we would want to know whether the board's current state is solved, wouldn't we? Our goal is to create a function that will check that for us!\n\nAssume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array, where the value is `0` if a spot is empty, `1` if it is an `X`, or `2` if it is an `O`, like so:\n```\n[\n    [0,0,1],\n    [0,1,2],\n    [2,1,0]\n]\n```\n\nWe want our function to return `-1` if the board is not solved yet, `1` if `X` won, `2` if `O` won, or `0` (zeroo) if it's a cat's game (i.e. a draw).\n\nYou may assume that the board passed in is valid in the context of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.\n\n###Notes\nBased on [Tic-Tac-Toe Checker](http://www.codewars.com/kata/tic-tac-toe-checker/javascript) kata by [eugene-bulkin](http://www.codewars.com/users/eugene-bulkin). \nDebugging kata was derived from solution by [By-The-Ocean's](http://www.codewars.com/users/By-The-Ocean) and [noisycricket](http://www.codewars.com/users/noisycricket). Kudos.\n\nIt's suggested that you don't feed on this one. Don't try to rewrite it completely, also. Just try to fix what's provided.\n",
