    "description": "## Description\n\nIn function `maxNum` you will be given an integer `num` and a 2D array `opers`.\n* `num` represents the length of an array of integers\n* `opers[i]` represents operations that you need to peform on `num`.\n\n## Operations\n\n* `opers[i]` has always a length of 3 and contains only integers. \n* The first integer `opers[i][0]` represents the index of `num` where the operation will `start`.\n* The second integer `opers[i][1]` represents the index of `num` where the operation will `end`.\n* The third integer `opers[i][2]` represents the number that needs to be added to the values of `num` from `start` (inclusive) and `end` (inclusive).\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nmaxNum(9, [[2, 3, 4], [3, 6, 7]])\n\n// num at first is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n// first operations on num is opers[0] therefore we have [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n// second operations on num is opers[1] therefore we have [0, 0, 4, 11, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\n// return value 11\n```\n\n## Assume\n\n* 3 <= num <= 3 * 10^5\n* 1 <= opers length <= 2 * 10^5\n* 0 <= opers[i][0] <= opers[i][1] < num\n* 0 <= opers[i][2] < 10^9\n",
