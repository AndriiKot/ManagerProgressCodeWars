    "description": "We call a triangle on XY-plane an empty triangle, if and only if:\n* All three vertices of the triangle are integer points,\n  which is to say their x and y coordinates are both integer.\n* Except for its three vertices, there is no integer point inside it or on the\n  edge of it.\n\nGiven two positive integer `N` and `M`, find the number of empty triangles in\nthe rectangular area with bottom-left corner `(0,0)` and top-right corner\n`(N,M)`.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EXZ0wiJ.png)\n\nFor example: For `N = 1` and `M = 2`, there are 12 such triangles:\n```\n{(0,0),(1,0),(0,1)} {(0,0),(1,0),(1,1)} {(0,0),(1,1),(0,1)} {(1,1),(0,1),(1,0)}\n{(0,1),(1,1),(1,2)} {(0,1),(1,1),(0,2)} {(0,1),(1,2),(0,2)} {(1,2),(0,2),(1,1)}\n{(0,0),(1,1),(1,2)} {(1,0),(1,1),(0,2)} {(0,2),(0,1),(1,0)} {(1,2),(0,1),(0,0)}\n```\nBut the triangle `{(0,0),(1,1),(0,2)}` is not counted, because an integer\npoint `(0,1)` lies on one of its edges.\n\nSince the answer can be very large, you are only required to return the\noriginal answer modulo `P`, where `P = 1000000007`.\n\n(That is to say: if the number of empty triangles is `1000000100`,\nyou only need to return `93`)\n\nIt is guaranteed that:\n* `1 <= N,M <= 2000`\n\nHint:\n* You may want to make use of some mathematical theorems.\n* If you find this kata is too hard for you, you may try the [past][pst] one.\n* If you find this kata is too easy for you, you may try the [future][ftr] one.\n\nNote:\n* Past is the lowest difficulty in a game called Arcaea.\n* Present is the moderate difficulty in a game called Arcaea.\n* Future is the hardest difficulty in a game called Arcaea.\n\n[pst]: https://www.codewars.com/kata/count-empty-triangles-in-the-past\n[prs]: https://www.codewars.com/kata/count-empty-triangles-in-the-present\n[ftr]: https://www.codewars.com/kata/count-empty-triangles-in-the-future\n",
