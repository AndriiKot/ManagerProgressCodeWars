    "description": "# In which our protagonist dreams of becoming a developer:\n\nAda really really wants to join a coding bootcamp. She has some `savings` but might need to borrow some money to be able to pay the `fees` for the bootcamp if she doesn't have enough saved.\n\n# In which our protagonist is offered help:\n\nAda's sister tells her that she is willing to lend her the money for an agreed amount of `months` but will charge her `monthlyInterest` and expects the loan to be repaid in the agreed amount of `months`.\n\n\n# In which our protagonist wants to dream responsibly: \nCalculate how much the coding bootcamp will end up costing Ada, including the amount she might need to borrow (_difference between_ `fees` _and_ `savings`) plus interest on the borrowed amount.\n\n# Assumptions:\n* `fees`, `savings`, `months` and `monthlyInterest` are all positive numbers; \n* `fees`, `savings` and `monthlyInterest` are floats.\n* `monthlyInterest` is a percentage (ex. 30.5 is to be interpreted as 30.5%)\n* return value is the total cost of the bootcamp.\n* interest is fixed.\n\n\n\n\n",
