    "description": "Hello fellow coder!\n\nI have a challenge for you! If you're familiar with Mathematics you may know the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is used to find solutions to x in a quadratic equation. The formula is as follows:\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Quadratic_formula.svg/2000px-Quadratic_formula.svg.png\" alt=\"Image result for quadratic formula\"/>\n\nYou can read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation\n\nYour solution should return a sorted list of the two solutions for x. If the two solutions are the same, it should only return one of them. e.g. if both solutions were 5 it would only return a single 5. The sorting should be in decending order. All valid solutions should be rounded to 2dp.\n\nExample:\nSay that a=1, b=8 and c=16. Your solution should return the following list:\n```python\n[-4]\n```\n\nOn top of this, you need to ensure that if b^2 - 4ac is a negative number, the program does not try and square root this number, and does not return any solution (just a blank list). I will try to make a more advanced kata in the future that uses \"i\", you can search up on Google \"imaginary numbers maths\" if you'd like to know more.\n\nIf you have any questions please feel free to ask and if there are any issues let me know! :)",
