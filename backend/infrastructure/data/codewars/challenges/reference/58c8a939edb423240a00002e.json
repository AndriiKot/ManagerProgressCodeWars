    "description": "My friend Jeremiah is very sensetive to loud noises.\n\nPeople talk to Jeremiah by passing him strings, but Jeremiah will get upset if anyone shouts at him. Shouting in a string is done by typing in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS (sorry Jeremiah)! Let's write a function that returns the string if it is safe to say to Jeremiah, and an empty string if it isn't.\n\nJeremiah doesn't mind the occasinal capital letter - he doesn't consider it shouting unless at least an entire word is written in all capitals letters. Your solution should not filter due to one-letter words such as \" I \", and should still be able to detect shouting through punctuation such as \" I'M \".\n\nFor example, Jeremiah doesn't mind this string:\n```javascript\nshoutingDetector(\"I'm cURIOUS what you had for breakfast, Jeremiah.\")\n//We would want this string to be returned by our detector.\n```\n\nBut if you were to say: \n```javascript\nshoutingDetector(\"I'M VERY angry with you, JEREMIAH!\")\n//We had better prevent this argument from getting to Jeremiah by returning \"\".\n```",
