    "description": "The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time longer than one year.\n\nTo calculate compound annual growth rate, divide the value of an investment at the end of the period by its value at the beginning of that period, raise the result to the power of one divided by the period length, and subtract one from the subsequent result\n\nThe formula can be written as:\n\n((Future Value/Present Value)^(1/n)) – 1\n\nExample:\n\n```\ncalculateCAGR(20,10,2)```  =>   41.42\n\nWhere first parameter is the Future Value, second is Present Value and third is the period length in years.\n\nGive your answer to 2 decimal points.\nAll tested parameters will integers and greater than ```0```.\n",
