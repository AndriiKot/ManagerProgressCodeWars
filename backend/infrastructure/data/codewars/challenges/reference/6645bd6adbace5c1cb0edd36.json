    "description": "## Charmander the Hero\n\nThe Team Rocket is chasing you, but Charmander is ready to take some hits and keep you safe for a while. Knowing that \n**Charmander has 100 HP** and that every attack deals damage to it equal to its power, calculate how many attacks Charmander can tank before fainting (Charmander has to have **HP > 0** after the hit for it to count towards the total).\n\n![Charmander](https://www.dexerto.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1080,quality=60,format=auto/https://editors.dexerto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/15/Pokemon-TCG-Charmander.jpg)\n\nBe aware that Charmander is a **Fire type pokemon**, so it has the following strengths and weaknesses:\n\n* **Weaknesses**:  `WATER`, `ROCK`, `GROUND`\n* **Strengths**: `STEEL`, `ICE`, `GRASS`, `BUG`, `FIRE`, `FAIRY`\n\n(*) Any other string will be considered as a **Neutral** type attack.\n\nIf Charmander is weak to the attacks's type, it will take twice as much damage **(x2)**, but if it's strong against it, it will take half the damage **(x0.5)**. If the attack is neutral, the loss of HP will be equal to the attack's power, without any modification **(x1)**.\n\nYou will receive **2 parameters** (`int`, `String`) indicating the power and type of the attack, and must return an `int` value indicating the number of hits of that kind that Charmander was able to take without fainting.\n\n#### Example:\n\n```\n50, \"WATER\" -> 0\n15, \"NORMAL\" -> 6\n10, \"GRASS\" -> 19\n```\n\n(*) In the tests cases, the power of the attack will always be higher than 0.\n",
