    "description": "In this kata you will be solving a problem of a store worker that specializes in stacking cans in pyramid shapes in stores, he only makes a pyramid with square bases and always puts a can on top of other 4 cans his problem is that sometimes does not get exact amount so he has to either buy more or return some. (He will do what is easier)\n\nYour task is to calculate the number he will return or buy.\n\nExample:\n3 cans -> 1 can or 5 cans (1-4)\nboth result are same distance so he will return or buy 2\n\n10 cans -> 5 cans (1-4) or 14 cans (1-4-9)\nhe will return 4 cans since 14 is closer to 10\n\nAs our worker is really dedicated he can obtain up to 1 +15e cans",
