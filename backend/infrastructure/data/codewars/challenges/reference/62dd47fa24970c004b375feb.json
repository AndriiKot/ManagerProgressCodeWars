    "description": "So, before you is a new kata about encryption.\nNow as dry and humorless as possible.\n\nIf you did not pass [the last kata (JavaScript)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/62d5254d755819004affc57d/javascript), then it will be difficult for you.\n\nEncryption example:\n```javascript\n'123' => 'cc20 h8jb0j 27i181 c91a0z 2cz28h 29h3a1'\n```\n\nThis time, as promised, the kata is more difficult. Maybe even overkill.\nIn addition, there will be few hints. Try this challenge!\n\nBut the boundaries of the study still need to be defined.\nSo, here is a list of facts about the cipher that should help:\n- no need to delve into bits\n- don't forget the Unicode table\n- carefully examine test cases\n- carefully read the name of the kata\n\nAfter viewing the test cases, you can come to the conclusion that always (in fact - *almost always*) with the same input, you will receive a new encryption at the output. Well, you'll be right. This is both a hint and additional complexity at the same time.\n\nGood luck!\n",
