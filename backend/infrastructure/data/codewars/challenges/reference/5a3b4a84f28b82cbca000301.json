    "description": "You must write a function that finds the rational zeros of a given polynomial function.\n\nThe polynomial will be passed as a string, such as ```x2 + x - 6```, with the power after the variable and spaces between each term. The variable will always be ```x```. The polynomial will always consist only of integer coefficients and be simplified as much as possible already (e.g. ```x2 + 3x2``` will always be ```4x2```).\n\nTo use the above polynomial as an example, ```x2 + x - 6``` = ```0``` when ```x = -3``` and ```x = 2```. Therefore, your function should return ```[-3, 2]```.\n\nA few notes:\n- Your function should return the zeros in ascending order.\n- Rational zeros must be returned as instances of class `Fraction`, e.g., `x = .5` as `x = Fraction(1, 2)`. (Integer zeros such as `x = 5` can be returned either as integers or instances of `Fraction`.)\n- Each zero must be included as many times as its root multiplicity is. For example, polynomial `x3 - 3x - 2` has a rational root `x = -1` with multiplicity two, and a rational root `x = 2` with multiplicity one, so `rational_zeros('x3 - 3x - 2')` should return `[-1, -1, 2]`.\n- If the polynomial has no rational zeros, return an empty list (```[]```).\n- Don't worry about if the polynomial has any other irrational or imaginary roots - just return the rational roots that exist.\n\nIf you're stuck, check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_root_theorem.",
