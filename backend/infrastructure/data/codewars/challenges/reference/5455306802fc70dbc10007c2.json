    "description": "Whenever college football teams are mentioned on TV and in print, the top team names are always preceded by their rank. For instance, if Nebraska is #15 and Purdue is unranked, they will be mentioned like so:\n\n    \"Purdue vs #15 Nebraska\"\n    \nCreate a class that accepts a list of ranked teams at initialization, and implements a **rankify** method that accepts a sentence, and adds rankings. Unranked teams should remain unmodified.\n\nAs an example:\n\n    football = Football.new(['Alabama', 'Nebraska', 'Oklahoma'])\n    football.rankify(\"Nebraska vs Alabama tonight at 7!\")\n      #=> \"#2 Nebraska vs #1 Alabama tonight at 7!\"\n      \nBe careful not to confuse ranked teams with similar names, like \"Texas\" and \"Texas Tech\"!",
