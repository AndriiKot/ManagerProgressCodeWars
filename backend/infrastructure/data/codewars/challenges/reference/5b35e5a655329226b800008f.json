    "description": "```javascript\nlet even = n => n === 0 ? true : odd(n-1);\nlet odd = n => n === 0 ? false : even(n-1);\n\nlet sumToN = (n, acc = 0) => n === 0 ? acc : sumToN(n-1, acc+n);\n```\n\nConsider the pair of mutually [tail-recursive](http://2ality.com/2015/06/tail-call-optimization.html#tail-recursive-functions) functions (```even``` and ```odd```) above. It naively determines if a non-negative integer is even or odd.\n\nIf most browsers' engines implemented tail call optimization, calls such as ```even(1000000)``` should take less than a second to run, but ```even(100000)``` already throws a stack error on Chrome.\n\nFor ```sumToN```, it calculates 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N recursively and returns the result, but throws a stack error at N = 10000 on my browser.\n\nTo get around this, write a function `makeStackSafe` that takes in a tail-recursive function as an argument, and returns a stack safe version of it, meaning that calling it with high values might take a long time to compute, but will not result in an error. It has to support mutual tail-recursion as well.\n\nAs a hint, you may want to look up on trampolines.\n\nThe test cases will be the same as the example test cases, but with the inputs changed to prevent hardcoding: \n\nYour code should be optimised enough to not cause a timeout for inputs of n between 100 000 000 and 200 000 000.\n```javascript\nlet evenStackSafe = makeStackSafe(n => n === 0 ? true : oddStackSafe(n-1));\nlet oddStackSafe = makeStackSafe(n => n === 0 ? false : evenStackSafe(n-1));\nevenStackSafe(100000000) === true;; //Should not throw an error\nlet sumToNStackSafe = (n, acc = 0) => n === 0 ? acc : sumToNStackSafe(n-1, acc+n);\nsumToNStackSafe(100000000); //Should not throw an error\n```",
