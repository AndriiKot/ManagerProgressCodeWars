    "description": "## Introduction\n\nYou've probably heard of factorials and there's a chance you've written, or attempted, to create some code which can calculate them.  There is a lesser known variant of factorials known as swinging factorials, of which the first few are 1, 1, 2, 6, 6, ...\n\n\n## Definition\n\nSwinging factorials have a technical definition:\n\n>a(n) is the number of vertices of the polytope resulting from the intersection of an n-hypercube with the hyperplane perpendicular to and bisecting one of its long diagonals. - Didier Guillet, Jun 11 2018\n\nThat probably doesn't help much, so, to get you started, here's a definition:\n\n```math\n\\begin{cases}\n   s_0 = 1 \\\\\n   s_n = n^{n \\text{ mod } 2} * (4/n)^{(n+1)\\text{ mod } 2} * a_{n-1} &\\text{for } n \\geqslant 1\n\\end{cases}\n```\n\nIf recursive definitions just aren't your thing (no judgement here!) there are alternatives, the discovery of which I shall leave as a classic 'exercise for the student'...\n\n\n# The problem\n\nWrite a function which generates the swinging factorial for a given positive integer, n.\n\nAll of the tests inputs will be valid, so there's no need to validate them.\n\n## Hint\n\nSwinging factorials are one of the sequences in the [OEIS](https://oeis.org/).\n\n## Bigger Hint\n\n[This](https://oeis.org/A056040) is the OEIS page you're looking for.",
