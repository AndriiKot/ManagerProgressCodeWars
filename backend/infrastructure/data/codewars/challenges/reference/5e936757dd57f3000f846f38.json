    "description": "**The dark sock of the drawer** (Estimated Rank : 6 kyu)\n\n***Introduction***\n\nIt's getting cold in your house and you aren't wearing any socks. You try to turn on the heater, but you remember that there's a power cut. You go in your room to get some socks but you can't see anything.\n\nYou open your drawer but you've got a problem : you can't find any pair of socks because you can't see anything. You know that in your drawer there is 9 different colors of socks. You do some math and decide to take 10 random socks out of the drawer.\n\nYou go back in the living room with the 10 socks you took. You can see the colors because of the daylight and you find two matching socks. Problem solved !\n\n***Task***\n\nYou will be given three arguments `num_of_c`, `num_of_soc_in_pair` and `num_of_pa_want` for the function `socks`. Yes, you can change the arguments' names.\n\n`num_of_soc_in_pa` represents the number of sock(s) in a \"pair\" (you can be an alien with 11 feet). `num_of_pa_want` represents the number of \"pair(s)\" you want.\nAnd finally `num_of_c` is the number of different colors you have.\n\nSupppose you can draw an infinite amount of socks from the drawer (that must be a big drawer !). `num_of_c` and `num_of_soc_in_pa` will always be strictly positive (> 0) and `num_of_pa_want` will always be positive (>= 0).\n\n***Examples***\n\n``` python\nsocks(3, 4, 3) # Should return 18\nsocks(1, 1, 0) # Should return 0\n```\n\n***Good luck and have fun !***\n\nUseless fact : the regex that matches both \"The dark sock of the drawer\" and \"The dark side of the force\" is \"The dark s(ock|ide) of the (draw|forc)er?\"\n\nOther problems of [Fun Problems](https://www.codewars.com/collections/5e8e10c835ad8c000f4e237b) :\n\n#1 • [A nugget problem](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5e823c4f0ab797001fde366b)\n\n#2 • The dark sock of the drawer (You are already on this kata !)\n\n#3 • Cutting paper (Not finished yet)",
