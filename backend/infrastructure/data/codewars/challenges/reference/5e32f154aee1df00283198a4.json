    "description": "<h2><font color=\"LightSeaGreen\">Bimaru</font></h2>\nsometimes called Battleship puzzle, Battleship Solitaire or Yubotu is a logic puzzle based on the Battleship guessing game. Solitaire Battleship was invented in Argentina by Jaime Poniachik and was first featured in 1982 in the Argentine magazine Humor & Juegos.\n<h2><font color=\"LightSeaGreen\">Rules</font></h2>\n<ol>\n<li> Place a fleet of ships into the diagram. There are several different types of ships: \n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=10></td>\n    <td width=140>three submarines ♦</td>\n    <td width=140>two destroyers ◄►</td>\n    <td>one cruiser ◄■►</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>  \n</li>\n<li> Each ship segment occupies exactly one cell of the diagram.</li>\n<li> Ships may be oriented horizontally or vertically and don't touch each other, neither orthogonally nor diagonally.</li>\n<li> The numbers on left/below edge of the diagram indicates how many ship segments must be placed in the corresponding row or column. Pass the clues in an array of 12 items. This array contains the clues around the clock</li>\n</ol>\n<br>Can you write a program that can solve this puzzle?\n<h2><font color=\"LightSeaGreen\">Example</font></h2>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"368\"><img src=\"https://s19.directupload.net/images/200207/mmb24f4w.jpg\"></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">In this example there are one boat square and one water square are specified.<br>The following characters are valid:<br>\n      <ul>\n        <li>bow or stern of a ship <code>◄ ► ▲ ▼</code></li>\n        <li>middle part of a ship <code>■</code></li>\n        <li>submarine <code>♦</code></li>\n        <li>water <code>X</code></li>\n      </ul>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<h2><font color=\"LightSeaGreen\">Input</font></h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>The grid is one string. Every row ends with newline separater. <br><code>\"      \\n      \\n      \\n  ▲   \\n    X \\n      \\n\"</code></li>\n  <li>The clues is an array of 12 numbers. This array contains around the clock (from top to bottom and right to left). \n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"300\"><img src=\"https://s19.directupload.net/images/200207/clo6j35c.jpg\"></td>\n    <td valign=\"top\">In this graphic, the numbers correspond to the index of the array.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</ul>\n<h2><font color=\"LightSeaGreen\">Output</font></h2>\n\nReturn the resolved puzzle as array of six strings. The class <code>Comparer</code> check only count, types and positions of the ships.\n\n<h2>Good Luck!</h2>\n\nIf you finished this kata you can use your solution as a base for the more challenging kata:<br>\n<i>coming soon... <font color=\"LightSeaGreen\">8 By 8 Bimaru Solver</font> </i>\n",
