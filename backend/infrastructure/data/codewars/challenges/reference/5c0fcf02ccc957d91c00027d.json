    "description": "This kata is based on an NPR Sunday puzzle I solved with a little program. I thought it would be fun to build a kata around it. Here's the puzzle:\n\nThink of an article of apparel in eight letters. \n\nDrop the last 2 letters.\n\nMove what are the now the last 2 letters to the front. \n\nYou'll get an article of apparel in 6 letters. What is it?\n\nThe answer to the puzzle was Monokini => Kimono\n\nMonokini <----- Originial Word<br>\nMonoki<strike style=\"color:red\">ni</strike>   <----- Drop the last two letters<br>\n<strong style = \"color:red\">Ki</strong>mono   <----- Move the new last two letters to the front<br>\n\n\n\nYou will be supplied two arrays - one filled with 6 letter words, and one filled with 8 letter words. Inside of the 6 letter word array is ONE eight letter word that went through the shift above. Find it and output both the OLD WORD and NEW WORD in an array. \n\n```javascript\n var sixLetterWords = [\"Blabla\", \"Ladeeda\", \"Kimono\"];\n var eightLetterWords = [\"Randommm\", \"Monokini\", \"Examples\"];\n \n findShiftedWord(sixLetterWords, eightLetterWords) => [\"Monokini\", \"Kimono\"]\n```\n\nIf there is no solution you should output an empty array.\n\n```javascript\n var sixLetterWords = [\"Blabla\", \"Ladeeda\", \"Kimono\"];\n var eightLetterWords = [\"Randommm\", \"Noanswer\", \"Examples\"];\n \n findShiftedWord(sixLetterWords, eightLetterWords) => []\n```\nPay attention to capitalization in your result. The tests will have only zero or one matching word.",
