    "description": "Dates in JavaScript (an in most computer systems) are counted from the breaking of dawn on the first day of 1970. Because... reasons.\n\nBut _people_ count dates from the dawn of year one (there is no year zero in the Gregorian Calendar). So let's fix that, shall we? Your task is to write two methods for the date object:\n\n## Date.fromSane(ms);\nThis method should accept one argument, an integer representing the number of milliseconds passed from year one. A new Date object should be returned containing the corresponding date.\n\n**NOTE:** This method should be used on the Date object itself, _not_ on Date instances.\n\n## new Date(...).toSane();\nThis method should return the number of milliseconds that have passed for the given Date object, counting from year one.\n",
