    "description": "The middle-square method is a method of generating pseudorandom numbers. In practice, it's not a good method, since its period is usually very short and it has some severe weaknesses. The defects associated with the original middle-square generator can be rectified by running the middle square with a [Weyl sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_sequence), which prevents convergence to zero.\n\n**Task**\n\nWrite a function `msws(seed, n)` that can generate the n-th random 16-bit long number. The implementation should result in fast performance.\n\n**Algorithm**:\n\n- raise r to the power of 2\n- update weyl number by adding marsaglia\n- add weyl to r\n- drop 8 bits from the right, extract 16 bits from the right to get new random r\n\n```\nmarsaglia = 362437\nr, weyl = seed, 0\n\n# repeat n times to get n-th random number r:\nr = r ** 2\nweyl = (weyl + marsaglia) % 2 ** 32\nr = (r + weyl) % 2 ** 32\nr = (r // 2 ** 8) % 2 ** 16\n```\n**Examples**\n![xx](https://i.imgur.com/01ijrKM.png)\n\n**Notes**\n- 0 <= seed, n <= 2^32\n- _Hint: a compiled program can run up to 200 times faster than a mathematically identical script in the Python interpreter._",
