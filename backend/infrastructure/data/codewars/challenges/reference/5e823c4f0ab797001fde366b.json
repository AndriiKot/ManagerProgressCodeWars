    "description": "**A nugget problem**  (Estimated Rank : 5 kyu)\n\n***Introduction***\n\nYou are walking outside and you are hungry. Luckily, you see a fast food restaurant, and you already know what you're going to eat : *nuggets*.\n\nLast time you went to this restaurant, you ordered too many nuggets. You couldn't eat them all :( . Now you know how many of them you will eat : 17.\n\nNow comes the real problem : you can't buy a box of 17. In this restaurant, they sell boxes of 4, 6, 9, and 20. You *could* buy a box of 20, but it's too much for you. So you do some math and decide to buy two boxes of 4 and one of 9, because it sums up to 17. You can finally eat some yummy nuggets.\n\n***Task***\n\nYou are given three arguments `box_one`, `box_two` and `nuggets_wanted` (you can change their names) for the function `nuggets`.\n\nThe problem is simplified. You only have two different boxes of nuggets. Your task is to return `True` if it is possible to obtain `nuggets_wanted` nuggets by buying boxes of `box_one` or `box_two` nuggets. Return `False` if you can't.\n\nSuppose you can buy an infinite amount of boxes. `box_one` and `box_two` will always be different and strictly positive, and `nuggets_wanted` will always be strictly bigger than both `box_one` and `box_two` or equal to `0`.\n\n***Examples***\n\n```python\nnuggets(3, 5, 23) # Should return True\nnuggets(3, 4, 5) # Should return False\n```\n\n***Good luck and have fun ! This is my first kata, hope you enjoy it !***\n\nOther problems of [Fun Problems](https://www.codewars.com/collections/5e8e10c835ad8c000f4e237b) :\n  \n#1 • A nugget problem (You are already on this kata !)\n\n#2 • [The dark sock of the drawer](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5e936757dd57f3000f846f38)\n\n#3 • Cutting paper (Not finished yet)",
