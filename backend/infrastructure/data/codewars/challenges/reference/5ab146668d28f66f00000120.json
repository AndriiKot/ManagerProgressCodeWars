    "description": "In this kata you will build a component to time a run and display the stats of the last few runs. \n\nGoal of this kata: Learn about React Lifecycle methods `componentWillMount`, `componentDidMount`, `componentWillUnmount`:  https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html\n\nTasks\n - in the `componentWillMount` method you initialize a timer that calls a function every 1000ms. Store the timer's id (return value of `setInterval`) as a property on the class (Note that the method `setInterval` is mocked for this exercise to make it work with codewars' test framework). The method called by the timer should increase a `count` variable, stored on the component's state\n - the async `componentDidMount` should fetch the latest stats from '/timed-stats.json', using the provided function `fetch('/timed-stats.json')` and store them in the component's state as `timedStats` (as this is about lifecycle methods, no need to display the result right now - of course you can if you want to :) )\n - in componentWillUnmount call `clearInterval` with the timer's id to cancel the timer. This is to make sure any resources are cleaned up\n - render the current count of the timer",
