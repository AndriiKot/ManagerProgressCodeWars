    "description": "I'm having a pizza party with a bunch of friends. Unfortunately, I only made two pizzes--one square and one circular. However, I am amazingly gifted at cutting pizzes. I am going to give everyone an equal slice of each pie. By equal, it has the same 2D shape--forget about the fact that the crust is higher than other parts of the pizza. The rules I follow for cutting pizzas are fairly standard. I can't fold or twist the pizza--I'm not making calzones. I can't lay one pie on top of the other--my guests loath a greasy bottom. The pizzas remain one layer high on my pizza-cutting table. I can start and finish a cut anywhere i want. For example, if I wanted to make three equal slices of a circular pizza, I would cut three straight lines from the crust to the center. There may be some extra toppings on one of the slices, but we'll call it equal for simplicity's sake.\n\nGiven n friends, I want to cut the pizzas in order to give everyone an equal--in shape and area--slice. What's the smallest amount of times I need to slice the pizza in order to make this happen? No folding allowed--the pizza must remain flat. Anything less than n=1 should return 0.\n\n\nCircular:\n\nExamples: Slice(1) --> 0\n\nExamples: Slice(3) --> 3\n\nExamples: Slice(4) --> 2\n\n\n\nSquare:\n\nExamples: Slice(1) --> 0\n\nExamples: Slice(3) --> 2\n\nExamples: Slice(4) --> 2 \n\n\nTogether:\n\nExamples: master_pizza_slicer(1) --> 0\n\nExamples: master_pizza_slicer(3) --> 5\n\nExamples: master_pizza_slicer(4) --> 4\n",
