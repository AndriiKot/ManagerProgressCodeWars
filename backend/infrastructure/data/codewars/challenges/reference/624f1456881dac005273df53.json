    "description": "This is Bug Problem #2 out of a series of Bug problems made by CalvinatorIA! These problems basically give you code to fix due to the bugs in it, and you have to fix it. Go squash those bugs!\n\nStory: Bill is still learning programming. He is trying to improve his previous program by adding a last name and a middle initial, but he is having problems again! Can you help him?\n\nHints:\n - Read the code carefully, very carefully.\n - Look for very minute errors in the code.\n - If you delete something, remember to keep what the original is trying to exucute.",
