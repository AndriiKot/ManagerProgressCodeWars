    "description": "As I'm sure we all know, damage dealt in Pokemon depends on Pokemon types. Every type has weaknesses and resistances. An attack can be super effective (2x damage), normal (1x damage), not very effective (0.5x damage), or not cause any damage at all (0x).\n\n\nYour challenge is simple. Create a function that has two parameters. The first parameter is the attacking Pokemon, the second parameter is the defending Pokemon. Your task is to return the damage multiplier this combination leads to. \n\nFor example:\nPokemon('fire', 'grass')\nwould return 2x\n\nNote – Pokemon weaknesses/resistances can be found here http://pokemondb.net/type ",
