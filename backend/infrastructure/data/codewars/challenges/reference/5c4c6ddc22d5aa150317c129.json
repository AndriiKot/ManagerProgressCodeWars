    "description": "Write a function to locate a substring within another string.\n\n- Your function must be named `searchForSubstring` and it should accept two parameters - a string to be searched and substring to be located within it. \n- This function should return an integer reprsenting the zero-based starting position of the substring, or -1 if it was not found. For example, \n```\nlet foundAtPosition = searchForSubstring(stringToSearch, stringToLookFor)\n```\n- Both the string to be searched and the substring to be searching for may be of any length.\n- These strings may contain any combination of letters, numbers, and punctuation.\n- Edge cases to test for include a substring to be searched for that is empty or longer than the string to be searched and a string to be searched that is of zero length.",
