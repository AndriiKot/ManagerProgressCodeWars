    "description": "You're fifteen years old and you've gone to your uncle's farm for the holidays. It's harvest season and your uncle has asked you to help him. The farm is selling the harvested fruit. People come to the farm, pick the fruit and pay for a piece. Some people collect different kinds of fruit and different prices in one basket.\n\nYour task is to sort and count these people's fruit. Don't worry, it won't be such a chore. You have a magic table at your disposal. The table has a magical property. When fruit is dumped on it,  \n\n***no two pieces touch each other. There's always a gap between each piece.***\n\nThe table top can have different dimensions.\n\n1. How many individual pieces of fruit are on the table?\n2. How many apples are on the table?\n3. How many berries are on the table?\n\n***The shape of the fruit can vary.***  \n***The apples are larger than four sizes of the smallest berry on the table.***\n\nWrite a function that returns the answer to these three questions in the form of ***list of three variables***.\n\nThe function is given an argument in the form of a photo. The photo shows the fruit and the table top. The photo is simplified. The pixels are replaced by the characters \"1\" for fruit and \"0\" for table top. Thus, each line contains a string of characters, for example 011100011. The new line is replaced by the character \"|\". Each row has the same number of columns. One photo of fruit on a table looks something like this: 000111110000|111001010010|111000110010\n\nIf we replace the \"|\" character with a line break character, a photo of an apple on a table looks something like this:\n\n000000011000  \n000000100100  \n000001000000  \n000111110000  \n001111111000  \n011111111100  \n111111111110  \n111111111110  \n111111111100  \n011111111000  \n001111111000  \n000010100000  \n(Apple with stem and core end on the table.)\n\n000000000000  \n000010000000  \n000111000000  \n001010000000  \n000100000000  \n000000001100  \n000000001000  \n000000000000  \n010000000000  \n001100000000  \n000110000000  \n000000000000  \n(Three barries on the table.)",
