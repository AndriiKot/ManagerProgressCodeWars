    "description": "We have a system that allows a user to modify their profile. A profile consists of a `name` and an `options` object that can be extended to include any sort of data.\n\nIn the past, there was a problem and normal users could become admins. The system has since been patched and it is now impossible to become an admin. Or it it?\n\nProve that you can break into this system by writting a function `main` that will make you an admin.\n\nNote that the sample test code is the same used to validate the solution.",
