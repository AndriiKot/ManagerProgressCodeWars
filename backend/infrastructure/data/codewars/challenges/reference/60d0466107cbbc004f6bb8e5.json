    "description": "## Story\nIt's the year 1997 and you are working at a computer workshop when suddenly Jim, your old fellow, rushes to you with a computer in his hands and a CD under his armpit. He said: \"My company wants me to get Windows 95 installed on this machine. I don't know how to install it. Can you help me?\". You nod your head, place his PC on your workbench, and start installing. Mid-installation the computer asks for the product key. Unfortunately, Jim doesn't have a product key with him, but you've known how the licensing system works for years.\n\n## How the algorithm works\nThe product key looks like: ```xxxxxxxxxxx```\n\nThe dash will sepreate the key into 2 sections: first 3 characters (section 1) and last 7 characters (section 2)\n\nIf section 1 isn't equal to 333, 444, 666, 777, 888 or 999, it's valid.\n\nSection 2 must be numeric and the sum of it's digits must be divisible by 7 to be valid\n\nIf any of the conditions mentioned above is not valid, the key is not valid\n\nNote: keys will ```always``` have a length of 10 characters and the 4th x is not checked\n## Task\nWrite function `validate_key()` that accepts an argument `key`, returns `True` if the key is valid, `False` otherwise",
