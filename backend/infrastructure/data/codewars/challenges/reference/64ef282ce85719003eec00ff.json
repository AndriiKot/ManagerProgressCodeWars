    "description": "There are two types of potions:\n\n1. Growing potion: \"A\"\n2. Shrinking potion: \"B\"\n\n- If \"A\" immediately follows a digit, add 1 to the digit.\n- If \"B\" immediately follows a digit, subtract 1 from the digit.\n\nCreate a function that returns a string according to these rules, removing the potions once they've been consumed.\n\n# Examples\n```\n\"3A78B51\" ➞ \"47751\"\n# 3 grows to 4, 8 shrinks to 7\n\n\"9A999B\" ➞ \"10998\"\n# First 9 grows to 10 and second 9 shrinks to 8\n\n\"6A123\" ➞ \"7123\"\n# 6 grows to 7\n\n\"567\" ➞ \"567\"\n# No change\n```\n# Notes\n- Digits that do not have a potion on their immediate right should be left alone.\n- A digit will always either be followed by **zero or exactly 1 potion.**\n- There won't be any 0 in the given string.",
