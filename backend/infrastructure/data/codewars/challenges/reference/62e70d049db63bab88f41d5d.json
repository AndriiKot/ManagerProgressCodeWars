    "description": "There is a function `round` expected, which is used to round numbers. It is a little bit weirdo so it decides on itself to round up or down. Additionaly it returns a diff between number and rounded number instead of only rounded number.\n\n\n`round()` takes one argument `num: number` and returns `[rounded: number, diff: number]`\n\nInput:\n- `num: number` - consists of a positive int or float number between `0` and `Infinity`. Example: `747247`, `56990`, `508196.42527266085`, `438197.9792489261`.\n\nOutput:\n- `rounded: number` - Rounded number represented by int - if `num` input base part is odd this should be rounded down, if `num` base part is even this should be rounded up (`0` is considered even). Example: `747247 (odd)`, `56990 (even)`, `508196.42527266085 (even)`, `438197.9792489261 (odd)` and `0 (even)`.\n- `diff: number` - difference between input `num` and output `rounded` represented as int or float.\n\nYou have to make it work!\n",
