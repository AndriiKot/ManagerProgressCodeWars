    "description": "Your task is to write a function which implements one-dimensional nth-order Bezier curves for arbitrary n.\n\nA first order (or linear) Bezier curve is simply linear interpolation (lerp) between two values. For example `lerp(1,2, .2)` would return `1.2`, `lerp(10, 20, .5)` would return `15`, and so on.\n\nA second order (or quadratic) Bezier curve is constructed out of first order curves, like this\n\n    quad(a,b,c,t) = lerp( lerp(a, b, t), lerp(b, c, t), t)\n\nHigher order curves are constructed by continuing this pattern.\n\nUsing this information, your must complete the function `bez(v, t)`, where `v` is an array of numbers with at least two elements, and `t` is the parameter for the curve, a number between 0 and 1.\n\nThe order of the curve should be `v.length - 1`, so for two values, you should do linear interpolation, for three, you should do quadratic, and so on.\n\nNumeric stability isn't a requirement for this kata, so solutions only need to be correct to three decimal places. The `approx` function is provided for use in your test fixtures for this purpose.",
