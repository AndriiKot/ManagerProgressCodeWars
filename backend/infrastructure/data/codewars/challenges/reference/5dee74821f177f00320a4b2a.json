However, you don't have too much time on your hands you can only move down or right and want to find the most possible amount of money you could obtain. For example,~~\n\n~~\\[\\[1, 2, 3],  ~~\n~~\\[4, 5, 8],  ~~\n~~\\[5, 1, 9]]~~\n\n~~will have the answer of 27, (1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 8 -> 9)~~\n\n~~You will be given a 2-D array of positive integers. The start will always be arr\\[0]\\[0] and the end point will always be at arr\\[-1]\\[-1].~~",
