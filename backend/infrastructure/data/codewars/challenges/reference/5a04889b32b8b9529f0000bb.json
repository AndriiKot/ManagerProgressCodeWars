    "description": "Billy Mayes was an infomercial legend who insisted on yelling everything as loudly as possible. Today we honor the late great Billy Mayes by creating a function that will take in a string (and only a string) as input and returning that str in all caps and with an additional three exclamation marks at the end.\n\n```\nbillyMaysify(\"hello\") // \"HELLO!!!\"\nbillyMaysify(\"but wait! there's more!\" // \"BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!!!!\"\n```\n\n*Only Strings will be tested*\n",
