    "description": "In Douglas Adams's *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, the supercomputer, Deep Thought, is asked to find the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. \n7.5 million years later, Deep Thought gives the answer: 42.\n\nOf course, it would be helpful if we were to know the question.\n\nIn the second book, it is said that the question is \"What do you get when you multiply six by nine?\"\n\nWhen working in base 10, we know that this is not true.\n9 * 6 = 54.\n\nHowever, if we consider 42 as a base 13 number, the answer becomes true.\nThat's because in base 13, 42 is 4 * 13 + 2, which equals 54 in base 10.\n\nBase 13 also needs some extra characters. Where we have 0-9, base 13 would have to have 13 \"digits\". Therefore, A, B, and C would represent 10, 11, and 12, respectively.\n\nIn the unlikely event that you encounter a space civilization that uses a base 13 number system, it would be helpful to be able to translate it into numbers you're familiar with!\n\nCreate a method **BaseThirteen** that accepts a string **input** that represents a base 13 number, and returns the base 10 equivalent.\n\nExamples: \n* *157  = (1 * 13 * 13) + (5 * 13) + 7, which is 241 in base 10.*\n* *ABC = (10 * 13 * 13) + (11 * 13) + 12, which is 1845 in base 10.*\n* *-42 = (-4 * 13) + (-2), which is -54 in base 10.\n* -6C5A = (-6 * 13 * 13 * 13) + (-12 * 13 * 13) + (-5 * 13) + (-10), which is -15285 in base 10.\n\nNote: The input will always be a valid base thirteen number.\n",
