    "description": "This task is rather simple: Generate a random maze of dimensions width x height.\n\nThe maze should be a width x height matrix (array of arrays):\n\n* Each cell must be an object having an x,y (row/column). \n\n* Every cell in the maze must have at least one path to any other cell (No unreachable cells exist).\n\n* Each cell must have have an opening in one or more of the following direction: North, South, East and West. Eg. a cell A connected to its right neighbor B will have A.east = B (and B.west = A).\n\n* The border may contain no \"exits\" - that is, the border should be unbroken.\n\n* All rows (in the matrix) should be of the same length.\n\n* Width and height arguments are always legal and at least 2.\n\n* Two maze of same dimensions should be different - but in the rare circumstances where Math.random gives similar results. \n\nA simple 2 x 2 maze is generated through:\n\n```javascript\nvar maze = [[{x:0,y:0},{x:1,y:0}],[{x:0,y:1},{x:1,y:1}]];\nmaze.cell = function(x,y){return this[y][x]};\nmaze[0][0].south = maze.cell(0,1);\nmaze[0][0].east = maze.cell(1,0);\nmaze[0][1].west = maze.cell(0,0);\nmaze[1][0].north = maze.cell(0,0);\nmaze[1][0].east = maze.cell(1,1);\nmaze[1][1].west = maze.cell(0,1);\n```\n\nYour solution will be tested with random starting and end points.\n\nA few helper functions are provided:\n\ncheckMaze(maze) - Run a few path checks on the given maze.\n\ndisplay(maze) - Returns a string depicting the maze. \n\nstringify(maze) - Generate a string containing a piece of JavaScript code representing the given maze. This was used to generate the example 'maze' above.",
