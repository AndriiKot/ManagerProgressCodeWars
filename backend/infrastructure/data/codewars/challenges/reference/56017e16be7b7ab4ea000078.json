    "description": "You started your new job as Junior Rails Developer 2 weeks ago. And your Mentor is very pleased with your progress, because of this he entrust you with one of his private projects.\n\nHe wants a film library with some functions. He tells you that he already finished the annoying part of this project, the data is present and the tests are ready. He also wrote some code and now it is your turn to impress your mentor, finish his work. Use heavily the test to accomplish your goal. \n\n- The preloaded variable is @film_library.\n Here is a extract from the structure\n \n```ruby\n@film_library = {\n  spaceballs: {\n    tags: ['hilarious', 'parody', 'cult', 'classic', 'science fiction']\n  },\n  starship_troopers: {\n    tags: ['satire', 'science fiction', 'cult' ]\n  },\n\n```\n- Create 2 instance methods:\n  -  ```list_all_movies``` Returns all available movies in a humanised form. (Use the test to get the clue)\n  - ```list_all_tags```  Returns all available tags in a humanised form.\n",
