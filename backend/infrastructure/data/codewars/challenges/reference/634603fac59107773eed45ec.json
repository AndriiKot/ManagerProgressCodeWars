    "description": "You are given a boolean variable named `x`.\n\nYou are also given two strings, `a` and `b`. \n\nReturn **a** if x is True, return **b** if x is False.\n___\nWait...\n\nThat's too easy... isn't it? To fix that, I've banned just a *few* things:\n- The `match` keyword is banned.\n- The keyword `is` is banned\n- Using external libraries is banned (no using `import`).\n- `Exec` and `eval` are banned.\n- The words `True` and `False` are also bannned. \n- Using `try/catch` is banned.\n- If your language has ternary operators, those are banned.\n\n**Oh yeah**, and I almost forgot...\n- No using the word `if`.\n- Your code must be less than `80` characters.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n\n",
