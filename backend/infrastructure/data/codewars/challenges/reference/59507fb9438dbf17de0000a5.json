    "description": "# Task\n\nJohn is playing a computer game called \"Catch the coin\". In the game, use the hat to move around and pick up the gold coins falling from the sky.\n\nThere are 11 positions(0...10) on the whole computer screen:\n\n![](http://bj.bcebos.com/v1/acmcoder/3630322324902218.png?authorization=bce-auth-v1%2F02fe1db0eea94e8480054b43acd6124f%2F2016-08-05T06%3A02%3A54Z%2F-1%2F%2Fa1b173f75300ac687c664cae81d6bbec15c427d1818561d636f58da998491549)\n\nThere are some coins appear on the screen with different height and position, They fall by a unit height per second. At the beginning of the game, the position of the hat is `5`. In the next second, the hat can move to the adjacent position or stay in the original position. If coins fall into the hat, the score increases by 1. If the coin didn't fall into the hat, it would fall to the ground and disappear.\n\nGiven an 2D array `coinsList`, each subarray in `coinsList` is a two-elements array `[position, nth second]`. For example, [6,1] means that the gold coin drops to the height of the hat in the 1st second. If the hat is exactly here, gold coins will fall into the hat. \n\nYour task is to calculate the maximum number of gold coins in the hat after the game is over.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n`[input]` integer `coinsList`\n\nAn 2D array. Each subarray is a two-elements array `[position, nth second]`.\n\n`1 <= coinsList.length <= 1000`\n\n`0 <= position <= 10`\n\n`1 <= n <= 200`\n\n`[output]` an integer\n\nThe maximum number of gold coins in the hat after the game is over.\n\n# Example\n\nFor `coinsList = [[5,1],[6,2],[7,3]]`, the output should be `3`.\n\nThe game screen looks like: \n```\n                     o\n                  o\n               o \n0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10\n```\nThe best way to move the hat can be:\n```\n                       coins\n1st second: stay at 5   +1\n2nd second: move to 6   +1\n3rd second: move to 7   +1\n```\n\nFor `coinsList = [[5,1],[6,2],[7,2]]`, the output should be `2`.\n\nThe game screen looks like: \n```\n\n                  o  o\n               o \n0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10\n```\nThe best way to move the hat can be:\n```\n                       coins\n1st second: stay at 5   +1\n2nd second: move to 6   +1\n(In this way, the coin at position 7 can not fall in to the hat)\n```\n\nFor `coinsList = [[10,5]]`, the output should be `1`.\n\nThe game screen looks like: \n```\n                              o\n\n\n                  \n               \n0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10\n```\nThe best way to move the hat can be:\n```\n                       coins\n1st second: move to 6   \n2nd second: move to 7\n3rd second: move to 8\n4th second: move to 9\n5th second: move to 10  +1\n```\n\nFor `coinsList = [[10,4]]`, the output should be `0`.\n\nThe hat can not move to position 10 at 4th second. Thus, the output is `0`.",
