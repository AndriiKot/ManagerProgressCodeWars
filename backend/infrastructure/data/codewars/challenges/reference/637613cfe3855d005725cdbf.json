    "description": "From the series Time Is Money, where I extrapolate the 13th commandment of PEP 20. Your function should be able to read any given Integer > 0 and say whether or not that number belongs in a sequence (I personally call, **The Atone Sequence** (Atonen Sequentia)) and return the position of that given number in The Atone Sequence. (see https://gist.github.com/shimon-d/20ec381f8865eb55311328dbb56d5462)\n\n\nBut first, what is this so called Atone Sequence:\n\n\n1 + 2 = 3\n\n3 + (2 * 2) = 7\n\n7 + (2 * 2 * 2) = 15\n\n15 + (2 * 2 * 2 * 2) = 31\n\n31 + (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2) = 63\n\n63 + (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2) = 127\n\nWhich is also to say:\n\n(2ⁿ) - 1\n\nHaving that in mind consider the following:\n\n`1 -> 1st`\\\n`3 -> 2nd`\\\n`7 -> 3rd`\n\nGiven the input -> `63`\nYour code should return the following `string`:\n\n'6th'\n\nA. That number belongs in the Atone Sequence\\\nB. The number position in the sequence is (in ordinal numbers) the 6th\n\nAny number out of the sequence and your function should return 'nope'\n\nTests of numbers up to 99 ^ 9999 are going to take place. Make sure your code is efficient not to time out.\n\n\n### Time Is Money Series\n[Number Of Operations](https://www.codewars.com/kata/636b03830ae6cd00388cd228)",
