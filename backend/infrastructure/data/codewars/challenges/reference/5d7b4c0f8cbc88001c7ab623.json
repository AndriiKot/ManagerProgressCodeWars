    "description": "In this kata you have to escape a mine with multiple levels. The map of the mine is hidden and you can only see the tile in front of you.\n\nWhen you enter the mine you will start at level 0 and face in a random direction. You will always start at the same position when you enter a level. There can be intersections and loops. You will never start in a loop though.\n\nIn later levels there will be items. \n\nYou will be able to use the following Actions:\n\n```javascript\n// Look in front of you\n// returns the type of tile in front of you\nminer.look()\n```\n```javascript\n// Turn left\nminer.turnLeft()\n```\n```javascript\n// Turn right\nminer.turnRight()\n```\n```javascript\n// Move to the tile in front of you\n// returns the result of you movement\nminer.move()\n```\n```javascript\n// Uses the item on the tile in front of you and moves there\n// returns the result of you movement\nminer.use(itemName)\n```\n\nUse `console.log(miner.look())` and `console.log(miner.move())`.\n\nAfter you escaped the mine some tests with random variations will make sure you did not hardcode the solution ;)",
