    "description": "An editor's \"delete\" key is broken on their old laptop, she therefore has to put a `<span>` opening tag and a `</span>` closing tag around any stretch of text that they do not want in the final copy of an article before sending it on to the printers. \n\nAn opening `<span>` tag is paired with the first closing `</span>` tag that appears in the text.  There will NOT be any stray span tags between any given pair.\n\nWrite a function \"unspan(text)\" that will delete both the opening and the following closing span tags, as well as all of the text between them.\n\nFor example, the editor received the following sentence from her author: \n\n\"This kata hasn't got me excited at all!\"\n\nShe cunningly adds a couple of span pairs and sends it on to the printing department:\n\n\"This kata has\\<span>n't\\</span> got me excited\\<span> at all\\</span>!\"\n\nThe printers can now use your function to get the desired sentence of:\n\n\"This kata has got me excited!\"\n\n______________________________\n\nIf the whole text is spanned, the function should return an empty string.  If none of the text is spanned, the text should not be affected by the function.",
