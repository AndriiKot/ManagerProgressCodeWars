    "description": "In this kata you are expected to find whether there are type error in the given string or not. The string will be consist of first operand white space operator white space and the second operand. The lenght of the operands in a range [1-5] (both 1 and 5 are included).\n\nFor example:\n\n```15 + 23 ```\n\nThere are only 4 operands which are ```+, * , - , / .``` As you know from their job they only do the operations if both operands are numbers. We need you to return the resulting string as follows:\n\nIf the operator is not one of the 4 then simply return ``` 'Operator is not defined.'```\n\nIf there is no error return ```'No error is found.'``` \n\nIf one of the operand is not number return ```'<operand name> is not number.'```\n\nIf both of the operands are not number then return ```'<first operand name> and <second operand name> are not numbers.'``` \n\nOperator errors has the highest presedence then two operands error which is higher than single operand error.\n",
