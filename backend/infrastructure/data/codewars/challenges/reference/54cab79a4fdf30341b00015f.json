    "description": "Your objective is simply to write a JS string evaluator, but the use of **eval** is fobidden.\nAll you'll be asked to do is complete operations of numbers, which will only have\n\n- **(**, **)**\n- **+**\n- **\\-**\n- **/**\n- **\\***\n- **Sqrt(n)**\n- **Pow(a, b)**\n\nYou won't be given any variables, just a string of numbers, spaces, operations and basic functions such as this:\n\n**\"(((1 + 2) *    4)/ Sqrt(  Pow(5,9))) - 3\"**\n\nand you'll have to just output the result as an integer, all of this with eval disabled. The output should be in the format of:\n\n**-2**\n\nwhich is the output of the above. The returned value can just be a truncated integer, to prevent js silliness to conflict with your algebraic cleverness, and if it's positive the sign doesn't need to be specified. Make sure that all of your 0s are not negative!\n\nYou don't have to worry about the string not being valid, such as a missing parenthesis or no operation between numbers. Good luck!",
