    "description": "I have a friend who is a school teacher and his wife made a mistake. He evaluated the students in a wrong way. Insted of given the student a 5 / 5 she gave a 1 / 5, instead of a 4 / 5 she did a 2 / 5. So the grades are inverted. I want to help my friend to correct his grades.\n\nBecause this could happen again I will param de solution with correct grade scale.\n\nEx. invertGrades(5,1) ret 5\n    invertGrades(5,5) ret 1\n    invertGrades(7,1) ret 7\n    invertGrades(8,2) ret 7",
