    "description": "DropSort is a very efficient, albeit arguably useless, O(n) sorting algoritm.\nIt examines an unordered list of numbers and removes any element which is not in order, essentially shrinking the list but at the same time sorting it.\n\nHere are a few technical details:\n\n- The algorithm is implemented as an extension method (static class, static method, and 'this' keyword before the first parameter)\n\n- The method will be tested against generic Lists of the following types (int, float, double, byte, sbyte, short), the lists will always have at least 2 elements, which can also have negative value.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n{ 1,2,4,3,8,7,6,9 } -> { 1,2,3,8,9 }\n\n{ -5,0,-3,1,-18,8 } -> { -5,0,1,8 }",
