    "description": "Given a Range Of the form [L, R] ,  The Task is to Return all ```The Sexy Prime Pairs ``` in the range in increasing Order.\n\n\n```\nSexy Primes are prime numbers that differ from each other by six. \n\nFor Example, The numbers 5 and 11 are both Sexy primes, Because they differ by 6 . \n```\n\n # *** Notes :: *** \n```\n1- The Function should return a Vector of Pairs , like the format :  {{11,17},{13,19}} . \n\n2- The range's boundaries [L:R] will always positives , L > 0 , and R > 0 .\n\n3- The range's boundaries [L:R] are inclusive , [L:R] is a closed interval . \n\nIf any of the previous points is not Clear , Just pay attention to The Examples clarify everything .\n\n```\n\n # ** Input :: Output Examples :: **\n\n```cpp\n1- sexyPrimes ([1:15])  return {{5,11},{7,13}} .\n\nExplanation :: \n\nInput : L = 1, R = 15 .\n\nOutput : {{5,11},{7,13}} . \n\nBecause each pair's numbers differ from Each Other By Six , as in the first pair the absolute differece between (5) and (11) is (6) , in the second pair the absolute differece between (7) and (13) is (6) ,and they in increasing Order.\n\n\n2- sexyPrimes ([11:19])  return {{11,17),(13,19}} .\n\nExplanation :: \n\nInput : L = 11, R = 19 .\n\nOutput : {{11,17),(13,19}} .\n\nBecause each pair's numbers differ from Each Other By Six , as in the first pair the absolute differece between (11) and (17) is (6) , in the second pair the absolute differece between (13) and (16) is (6) ,and they in increasing Order.\n\n\n3- sexyPrimes ([1:30])  return {{5,11},{7,13},{11,17},{13,19},{17,23},{23,29}} .\n\nExplanation :: \n\nInput : L = 1, R = 30 .\n\nOutput : {{5,11},{7,13},{11,17},{13,19},{17,23},{23,29}} .\n\nBecause each pair's numbers differ from Each Other By Six , as in the first pair the absolute differece between (5) and (11) is (6) , in the second pair the absolute differece between (7) and (13) is (6) ,and so on .. , they in increasing Order. \n```\nIf you feel Enjoyed this Kata , Then How About (Monkey With) in this # **  Numbers Series **\n\n<a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a4e3782880385ba68000018\" >Balanced Number </a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a4d303f880385399b000001\" >STRNOGN - Strong Number </a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a53a17bfd56cb9c14000003\" >Disarium Number </a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a54e796b3bfa8932c0000ed\">Jumping Number</a>\n\n<a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a55f04be6be383a50000187>Special Number</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a58d889880385c2f40000aa\">Automorphic_Number</a>\n\nHope you enjoy it ..
