    "description": "### Task\nAn **out-shuffle**, also known as an _out faro shuffle_ or _a perfect shuffle_, is a controlled method for shuffling playing cards. It is performed by splitting the deck into two equal halves and interleaving them together perfectly, with the condition that the top card of the deck remains in place.\n\nUsing a list to represent a deck of cards, an out-shuffle looks like:\n```\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] ➞ [1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8]\n// Card 1 remains in the first position.\n```\n\nIf we repeat the process, the deck eventually returns to original order.\n\n**Shuffle 1:**\n```\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] ➞ [1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8]\n```\n**Shuffle 2:**\n```\n[1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8] ➞ [1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n```\n**Shuffle 3:**\n```\n[1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8] ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n// Back where we started.\n```\n\nWrite a function that takes a positive even integer representing the number of the cards in a deck, and returns the number of out-shuffles required to return the deck to its original order.\n\n### Examples\n```python\nshuffle_count(8) ➞ 3\n\nshuffle_count(14) ➞ 12\n\nshuffle_count(52) ➞ 8\n```\n\n### Notes\n- 2 <= deck size <= 10^4",
