    "description": "Hey!\nToday your task will be make a translator into Tarabar language.\n\nmaketrans() and translate() is not allowed \nYou have two strings:\n\n\n\n`first = \"BCDFGHJKLM\"`\n\n\n\n`second = \"NPQRSTVWXYZ\"`\n\n\nAlso you have a function: `translator(word)`.\n\nYou need to replace all the consonants from the word that are in the first string with the consonants in the second string, thus: for example, you have the letter \"B\". Its index in the first line is 0. You need to find the letter with the same index in the second line(it's \"N\"). It also works the other way around. If the word has a consonant from the second line, you need to find out its index in the second line and find the letter with the same index in the first line and replace it.\nIf the word have letter \"Z\" you have to ignore it. You also have to ignore all the vowels.\n\n\n*Examples:*\n\n\n\ntranslator(\"abc\") => \"anp\"\n\n\ntranslator(\"Hello\") => \"Texxo\"\n\n\ntranslator(\"xyZ\") => \"lmZ\" #ignore Z\n\n\n\nAs you see you need to save the registr too\n\n",
