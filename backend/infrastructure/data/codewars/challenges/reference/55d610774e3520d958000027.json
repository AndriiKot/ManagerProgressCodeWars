    "description": "Write a function that will tell the time of a given Fibonacci Clock. The function should return a string in 12 hour format without AM/PM designation e.g. '2.30'\n\nA Fibonacci Clock is composed of 5 squares. A square can be assigned one of three colours, or left blank (white). Each colour holds a value and the size of the square determines the factor that this value is multiplied by. The factors are taken from the Fibonnaci sequence, starting with the smallest squares - 1, 1, 2, 3, 5. The time (in minutes) is found by multiplying the factors by the subsequent colour values and then adding them together. \n\nThe time will be passed as a string that consists of a digit (Fibonnaci factor) followed by a colour code: (R = Red, B = Blue, G = Green) \n\nFor more info on Fibonacci numbers follow this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number\n\nHere are the Fibonacci strings of the first three clock faces along with their time strings:\n\n'5R + 3B + 2G + 1R' = '9.25'\n\n'5B + 3G + 1G' = '5.45'\n\n'5R + 2R' = '7.00'\n\nTo work out each colour's value you'll have to use the clock faces below along with their Fibonacci strings.\n\n\n![alt text](https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/666/758/b12c4af6c7b34453f0b739426c224188_original.png?v=1429820247&w=700&h=&fit=max&auto=format&lossless=true&s=7ce59cf34a0244edb1ece8f54358636e)\n\n",
