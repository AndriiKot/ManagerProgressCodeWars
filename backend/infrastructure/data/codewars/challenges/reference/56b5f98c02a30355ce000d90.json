    "description": "In the end of one year or other festivals, the `Syachiku`s of a part of companies might receive some rewards. One form of such rewords is discount card of supermarket.\n\nDiscount card is of certain value, and able to be used when the payment of the purchase is higher than its value. It should be used for once only.\n\nNow you has one discount card of 500 Yen (yes, how evil the capitialism is, syachiku is poor). You have listed several things to buy, and found each prices in shop. For each kind of things you just need buy one. You should check at least how much money you should take with yourself to use the discount card out.\n\nFor example, you have 500 Yen now; and your wish list is as following. For easy, no tax here (Abe Seiji is not here).\n\n  1. Coffee - 100 Yen\n  1. Bread - 200 Yen\n  1. Milk - 120 Yen\n  1. Cake - 300 Yen\n  \nYou can soon find that, of four Coffee, Milk and Cake would be chosen with price 520 Yen as cheapest case beyond 500 Yen. So you just need take 20 Yen as cash and the discount card with you.\n\nNow give the wish list with price only, such as `[100,200,120,300]`, write a function `computeLowest()` to return the cash `20`.\n",
