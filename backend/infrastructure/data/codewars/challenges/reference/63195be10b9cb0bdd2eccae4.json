    "description": "Welcome to your first day in the Marble Factory!\n\nYou have been assigned as the head of Metallic Marbles Department. \n\nThis is how the production system works:\n1. A metallic cube of a given length is melted down to a liquid. \n2. The molten metal is then used to form sphere shaped balls/marbles of a given radius.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nYour purpose is to find out:\nThe number of balls/marbles that can be produced with each input.\n\n\nFor Example:\n\n```javascript \nnumberOfSandwiches(10, 3) -> 8\n//The case where no balls can be produced\nnumberOfSandwiches(1, 2) -> 0\n\n",
