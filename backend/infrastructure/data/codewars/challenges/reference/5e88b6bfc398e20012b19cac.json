    "description": "**TASK:**\n\nYou are giving a number of random people, n, some money. All the money that you'll be giving them is in $1 bills because you want to be as precise as possible. Given that you have m dollars and n number of people to split it with, find the number of total ways it can happen. The input range for m is from 1 to 20 and the input range from n is from 1 to 20.\n\n**RETURN:**\nReturn the total number of ways you can split m dollars with n number of people.\n\n**EXAMPLES:**\n```\nsplit_money(m, n)\n```\n\n**Smaller Examples:**\n```\nsplit_money(3, 2) = (3, 0), (2, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3) --> returns 4\nsplit_money(4, 3) = (4, 0, 0), (3, 1, 0), (3, 0, 1), (2, 2, 0), (2, 1, 1), (2, 0, 2), (1, 3, 0), (1, 2, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 0, 3), (0, 4, 0), (0, 3, 1), (0, 2, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 0, 4) --> returns 15\nsplit_money(1, 4) = (1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1) --> returns 4\n```\n**Larger Examples:**\n```\nsplit_money(7, 5) returns 330\nsplit_money(6, 3) returns 28\nsplit_money(5, 5) returns 126\n```\n**NOTE:**\nA person can have $0. Return your answer as an integer. For example if your answer is in the form of e, make it an integer.",
