    "description": "Given a number of undefined length as a string, you will have to:\n\n- Calculate the maximum product of four adjacent digits in the number. For instance: \"The maximum product of four adjacent numbers in 12345678987654321 is 4032 (7x8x9x8)\"\n \n- Calculate the average between all the calculated products, rounded up to two decimals\n \n- Return the difference between the maximun product and the average value of products\n\nFor instance, in the number: '12345678987654321', the difference between the biggest product (4032) and the average product (1548.92) is the result of 7x8x9x8, so it will return 2483.08",
