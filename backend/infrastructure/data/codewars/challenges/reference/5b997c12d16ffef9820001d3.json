    "description": "You’re an English teacher in primary school.\n\nYour aim is to make sure the kids are aware of the best times to use <b>capital letters</b> once you get to the end of your current sentence and want to begin a new one.\n\nRemember not all <i>fullstops equal the end of a sentence</i>. If there are <b>3 or 4</b> in a row, thats an ellipsis which does not necessarily signify the end of a sentence. An ellipsis is used when omitting a word, phrase, line, paragraph, or more from a quoted passage. \n\n... Also, be sure to let the students know if they’re missing their answer.",
