    "description": "<h2 style=\"color:#e8e005\">A riddle one, day one.</h2>\nYou are a researcher of ancient temples and tombs, and it seems that you stumbled upon something that you shouldn't have...\n You have found yourself in a room unknown to you, which was not previously marked on maps by other people who explored this place.\n In front of you is a door with a lock, and on the lock is an incomprehensible set of characters.\n\n This is very strange, because the symbols are the modern English alphabet, which does not correspond to the structure, which is approximately more than 1000 years old. Will you be able to decipher this cipher and open the door? \nYou don't understand where the English alphabet comes from in that place, but it seems to you that the words are there, as if the alphabet was inverted. You also see numbers between the letters, maybe it's indexes, or the order of digits in a word?\n\nHere are examples of what you can see on that door :<p></p>\n<code>decryptIt(\"l1o2o3v4S5\")</code>--><code>\"Hello\"</code><p></p>\n<code>decryptIt(\"v2i4v4s5g7\")</code>--><code>\"there\"</code>\n<img src=\"https://flytothesky.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/434.jpg\" style=\"width:60%\">",
