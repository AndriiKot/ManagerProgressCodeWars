    "description": "R, a programming language used for Statistics and Data Analysis, has the function `order`, which returns a list with the indices needed to sort the original vector(∗).\n\nFor example:\n```\nmy_arr = [1, 3, 3, 9, 8]\n# Ordered would be: [0, 1, 2, 4, 3]\n```\n\nIn plain words, `order` tells you what elements to look at in your original vector to sort it. The list `my_arr[0] + my_arr[1] + my_arr[2] + my_arr[4] + my_arr[3]` is equivalent to `sorted(my_arr)`.\n\nIf two or more elements have the same order, their original order is preserved. Here, `[0, 1, 2, 4, 3]` and `[0, 2, 1, 4, 3]` would both sort the vector, but only the first one preserves the original order for the two `3`s.\n\nImplement the function `order()` so that it works the same way it does in R.\n\n### Examples\n```\n[9, 1, 4, 5, 4] ➞ [1, 2, 4, 3, 0]\n\n[\"z\", \"c\", \"f\", \"b\", \"c\"]) ➞ [3, 1, 4, 2, 0]\n```\n\n### Notes\n- Expect numbers and lower-case alphabetic characters only.\n- Find Part I: Rank [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/65006177f534f65b2594df05).\n- Vectors in R are similar to a list. Although vectors in R are 1-indexed, your function should be 0-indexed. Other differences between vectors and lists will be ignored for the scope of this challenge.",
