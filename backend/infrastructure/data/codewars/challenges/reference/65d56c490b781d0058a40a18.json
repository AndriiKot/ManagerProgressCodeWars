    "description": "The U.S.A has to many librarys and needs to know wich ones to sell so the president got a censues of the average satisfaction rating of each library, but he ran into a problem. Some librarys in an area had higher space themed satsifaction than the others and the overall satisfaction was not the highest. Furthermore the area loved space themed books more than any other kinds of books. So he started counting and counting. It was so much that he hired you to create a program to find the best library in an area. You wil be given a list of dictionarys like this ```[{\"space\":10,\"magigal\":45,\"history\":2},{\"space\":4,\"magical\":30,\"history\":0}]```  and you will be given the most popular subject. Your function should fit these requirements    \n1. Return the index of the best library\n\n2. YOU MUST NOT MUTATE THE ORIGINAL PARAMETERS!\n\n\nYou will get honer by voting rank on this! ",
