    "description": "Removed due to copyright infringement.\n\n<!---\n\nJohny has fallen in love with an attractive girl called Parmida since one year ago...\n\nToday, Johny set up a meeting with his partner in a romantic garden. Unfortunately, Johny has forgotten where the garden is. But he remembers that the garden looks like a `square` with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. He also remembers that there is exactly `one tree on each vertex of the square`. Now, Johny knows the position of only 2 of the trees. Help him to find the position of 2 remaining ones.\n\n# Input:\n\nThe input contains two pairs of coordinates:\n```csharp\n0 0 0 1\n```\nWhere first two numbers are coordinates of the first tree. And second two numbers are coordinates of the second tree. Be careful,  ` !Numbers can be negative`\n\n# Your task, Daniel-san:\nReturn two pairs of coordinates that correspond to the coordinates of the two other trees. If there is no solution, return `-1` ;\n\n```csharp\nGarden.Trees(0, 0, 1, 1) ==  \"0 1 1 0\";\nGarden.Trees(0, 0, 0, 1) ==  \"1 0 1 1\";\nGarden.Trees(0, 0, 1, 2) ==  \"-1\";\n```\n\n--->",
