    "description": "# Swarm bots - swarm intelligence #1 \nSwarm bots have been an idea that has fascinated you for quite some time, But now you've decided to create your own bots that just roam around an array following no sense of direction. But after awhile watching them roam aimlessly you want to make them create some cool patterns.\n\n## Task\nYou must complete the ```Bot``` class, your Bot class should be able to roam aimlessly when no pattern has been given. But when a map has been set your bots must line up in one of the slots, simple as that!\n\n## Info\nThe ```Bot``` class takes two arguments and ```id``` and ```position```, the ```id``` will be an int used to define that bot and the ```position``` will be an object containing two peoperties ```x``` and ```y``` this will be the starting position of the bot.\n\nThe Bot class will have a setter and a method called ```map``` and ```move```. The ```map``` setter will be used to set the map that the Bot must position itself on an ```X``` within the 2D array. The ```move``` method must a string containing 1 character. The characters represent the action of the Bot they are as follows: ```u``` (up), ```d``` (down), ```l```(left), ```r```(right) and ```s```(stay). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### references\n[Swarm robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_robotics)",
