    "description": "Task description\n----------------\n\nSimple kata to safetly go thru arrays.\nBe aware of incorrect inputs.\n\nYou have to implement 2 functions: `findDescription` and `countWords`.\n\nfindDescription:\n----------------\nShould find given `word` in given `dictionary` and return it's description.\n~~~if:javascript\n`dictionary` is array which consist of:\n```javascript\n{\n    keys;\n    description;\n}\n`keys` will be [] of strings or nulls. Could be also `null`.\n`description` will be string or null.\n```\n~~~\n~~~if:typescript\n`dictionary` is array which consist of (preloaded) interface:\n```typescript\ninterface WordDescription {\n    keys: (string | null)[] | null;\n    description: string | null;\n}\n```\n~~~\nEach element in given array will be called: `entry` (our `dictionary entry`).\n\nExample entry:\n```typescript\n{\n    keys: ['home', 'house'];\n    description: 'Place where you live.';\n}\n```\n\n`keys` can have more than one entry (synonyms).\n\nMatching requested `word` to `keys` in our dictionary should be case insensitive.\n\nWhen there is no valid solution return empty string.\n\nCorruped entries:\n-----------------\nSometimes there can be `corrupted entry`, so you should make your solution bullet-proof safe.\n\n`Corruped entries` are when entry has no keys or has empty description.\n\nDepends on language (where `null` is assignable) `null` keys or `null` description should be also treated as corrupted.\n\nExample corruped entry:\n-----------------------\n```typescript\n{\n    keys: [];\n    description: null;\n}\n```\n\ncountWords\n----------\n\nYour goal is to count words in given `description`.\n`It's` (and such words) should be counted as `1`.\nSame goes for words like `son-in-law`.\nValid word has to have at least one letter.\nValid word can have `-` and `'` inside it, but such characters cannot be at start nor end of word.\nIf there is no valid words or input is empty - return 0.\n\nExamples:\n\n`\"Simple, short description for start.\"` should return `5`\n\n`\"\"` should return `0`.\n\n`\"1. ###\"` should return `0`.\n\nNote:\n-----\n* All valid descriptions will consist of single line only (no line breakes).\n* Provided dictionary will have at most 1 definition for given `word`.",
