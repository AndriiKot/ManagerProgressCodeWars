    "description": "# Motivation (not needed for solution):\nPeople like people who are like themselves or how they would like to be(ignore exceptions to this rule). So if a person wants to be liked by another person it can start by creating a feeling of commonality. Before searching for a common interests it makes sense to find out if a thing that the one person is interested in is somehow related to a thing that the other person is interested in.\n\n# Task:\nImplement a Method\n```cSharp\npublic static bool Related(string x, string y, string knownRelations = \"\");\n```\nthat returns whether two things “x” and “y” are related or not.\nIn a non trivial scenario the Method is called with a third  parameter “knownRelations” that specifies known Relations.\n\n# Technical details:\nThe Method Related takes two or three strings as parameters.\nIn the third string “knownRelations” the individual **known Relations are separated by “;”** and the **connection between two things is represented by a “-”**.\nIn more technically terms the “-” represents the edge between two nodes (aka vertices) and “x” and “y” are string representations of such nodes.\n\n\n# For examples see the Example Test Cases.\n\n\n# Performance\nPerformance tests are random to some degree. The individual inner performance test has a limited amount of nodes and edges:<br>\n**10000 <= #nodes < 20000**<br>\n**2/3 #nodes <= #edges < 4/3 #nodes**<br>\n<br>\nYour implementation will **fail if** its cumulative \"performance\" (in the performance tests) is more than **10 times \"slower\" than that of the reference solution**.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n-gl hf &#x1f680;\n",
