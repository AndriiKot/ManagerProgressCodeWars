    "description": "Given coefficients `a` and `b`, find a value for `x` such that `a*x == b`. Note that the numbers `a`, `b`, and `x` are all two’s-complement 32-bit ints, and multiplication may overflow. You may assume that a solution for `x` exists and is unique.\n\n### Example 1\nIf `a = 3` and `b = 12`, then `x = 4`, because `3*4 == 12` as 32-bit integers.\n\n### Example 2\nIf `a = 3` and `b = 13`, then `x = 2863311535`, because `3*2863311535 == 13` as 32-bit integers.\n\n### Example 3\nIf `a = 17` and `b = -1`, then `x = 252645135`, because `17*252645135 == -1` as 32-bit integers.\n\n## Performance Note\nYour function will be tested against a very large number of linear equations. To pass without timing out, your solution should have reasonable performance. This problem can be solved in `$O(1)$` runtime complexity!",
