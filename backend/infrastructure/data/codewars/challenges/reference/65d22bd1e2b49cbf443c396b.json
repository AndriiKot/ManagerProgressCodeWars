    "description": "Odd numbers are not closed under addition (the sum of two odd numbers is always even), but they are closed under multiplication (the product of two odd numbers is always odd).\n\nYour task is to define multiplication for the Peano-like system of positive _odd_ numbers, such as is in the preloaded code:\n\n```haskell\ndata Odd = One | Next Odd\n```\nwhere of course `One` corresponds to `1`,  `Next One` corresponds to `3`,  `Next (Next One)` corresponds to `5`, and so on...\n\nSince working with Peano (-like) numbers is not the most effective computationally, the tests will only use odd numbers less then `2000`.\n",
