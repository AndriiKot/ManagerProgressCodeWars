    "description": "Your task is to write a constructor function that returns a \"privileged array,\" as defined below.\n\n# _new PA()_ or _PA()_\n\nShould return a \"privileged\" function for accessing and manipulating the array. There should also be a \"frozen\" property on that function that is incapable of setting any values.\n\n# _new PA(length)_\nShould return a new PA, with the length set.\n\nThe `length` parameter must be an primitive number integer of 0 or higher. Otherwise, an exception should be thrown.\n\n# _new PA([arg1], [arg2], ... [argn])_\nShould insert each argument as an item within the array.\n\nEach function should behave similarly:\n\n# _instance(key)_ or _instance.frozen(key)_\n\nIf a valid key was given, the relevant value should be returned.\n\nIf the key is an index (**an integer 0 or greater, or a string of such an integer**), the corresponding value within the array should be returned. If no value has been set there, `undefined` should be returned.\n\nIf the key is **the string value \"length\"**, the length of the array should be returned.\n\nAll other keys are invalid, and should return `undefined`.\n\n# _instance(key, value)_ or _instance.frozen(key, value)_\n\nIf the key is an index (see above), the corresponding index within the array should be overwritten by the new value.\n\nIf the key is **the string value \"length\"**, and the value is an integer 0 or greater, the array's length should be changed to the given value.\n\nIf there were values stored in indeices from `length` onwards, those should not be accessible from then on; any attempt to read them should return `undefined`. Values can still be stored in those indices, just as before.\n\nIf using the `frozen` function, the new value should not be set.\n\nThe given `value` should always be returned.",
