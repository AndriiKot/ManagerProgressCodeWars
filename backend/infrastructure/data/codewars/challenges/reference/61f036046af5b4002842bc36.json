    "description": "You are commanding one of the heaviest artillery cannons ever built. It is built out of a material that can't burst and therefor you can load the chamber with as much gunpowder you want. You use TNT as propellant, but you don't know how much to requisition.\n\nAssume gravitational pull to be constant and  9.81 m/s**2. Your projectiles weigh 5 kg. The energy equivalent of one ton of TNT is  4.184 megajoules. Atmosphere can be assumed nonexistent. Your canon can fire under any angle. Cannon and target can be asummed to sit on the same level of elevation. The world can otherwise be assumed to be an empty plane.\n\nCalculate the minimal amount of TNT (in Tons) needed to reach a target at a certain distance (in meters).",
