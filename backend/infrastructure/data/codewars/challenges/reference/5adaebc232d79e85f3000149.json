    "description": "Two strings, a and b, are said to be twins only if they can be made equivalent by performing some number of operations on one or both strings. There are two possible operations:\n\nSwapEven: Swap a character at an even-numbered index with a character at another even-numbered index.\n\nSwapOdd: Swap a character at an odd-numbered index with a character at another odd-numbered index.\n\nFor example, a = \"abcd\" and b = \"cdab\" are twins because we can make them equivalent by performing operations. Alternatively, a = \"abcd\" and b = \"bcda\" are not twins (operations do not move characters between odd and even indices), and neither are a = \"abc\" and b = \"ab\" (no amount of operations will insert a c into string b).\n\n\nAn array of n strings named a.\nAn array of n strings named b.\nThe function must return an array of strings where each index i (0 ≤ i < n) contains the string \"Yes\" if a(i) and b(i) are twins or the string \"No\" if they are not.\n\nConstraints:\na(i) and b(i) are not guaranteed to have the same length.\nStrings a(i) and b(i) contain lowercase letters only (i.e., a through z).\n\n\nExplanation:\nGiven a = [\"cdab\", \"dcba\"] and b = [\"abcd\", \"abcd\"], we process each element like so:\n\na0 = \"cdab\" and b0 = \"abcd\": We store Yes in index 0 of the return array because a0 = \"cdab\" → \"adcb\" → \"abcd\" = b0.\na1 = \"dcba\" and b1 = \"abcd\": We store No in index 1 of the return array because no amount of operations will move a character from an odd index to an even index, so the two strings will never be equal.\nWe then return the array [\"Yes\", \"No\"] as our answer.\n\nFor example:\n\nSample Input:\n------------\n\ncdab\ndcba\n////\nabcd\nabcd\n\nSample Output:\n-------------\nYes\nNo",
