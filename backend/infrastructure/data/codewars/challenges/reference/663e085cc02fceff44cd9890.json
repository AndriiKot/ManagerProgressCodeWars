    "description": "You are a student in a chemistry lab. Your mentor hands you two canisterss filled with a water-solution of Unobtanium™ and sets you a task. Each canister has written ratio Unobtanium™ to water, and you need to mix them to obtain a new solution of Unobtanium™ with specified ratio.\n\nSince you're just a beginner, you won't have access to pure Unobtanium™, Specially Prepared Unobtanium-Solving Water (SPUSW™), or other laboratory equipment, limiting your options, therefore certain concentrations will be beyond your reach. \n\nFor this kata you need to calculate mix ratio for two solutions in the form (a, b) simplified to the lowest possible terms, or answer None/NULL/nullptr (depending on a language) if required solution is unobtainable.\n\nYou will be given three ratios in percents: for two original cans and required ratio. All inputs are integer and valid, and in range \\[1, 100\\]. \n\nExample:\n```\n22, 88, 50 -> 19, 14\n50, 50, 0 -> None/NULL/nullptr\n```",
