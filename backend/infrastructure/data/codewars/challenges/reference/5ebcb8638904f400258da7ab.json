    "description": "Cats love pats, but only good pats, and you need to determine if the cats like the pats given to them.\n\nThere are 2 variables: `pats` and `satisfaction`.\n\nObviously the more pats you give a cat, the happier it'll be, but that doesn't determine the quality of the pats. If you pat a cat once and you get 5000 satisfaction, that's a massive difference from a dog patting a cat (well, fighting with the cat actually) 5000 times and getting 5000 satisfaction.\n\nIf the satisfaction purr...um, satisfaction PER pat is greater than 5000, return `'Purr'`. Otherwise, return `'Hiss'`.\n\nAnd there's 1234 random tests, so make sure your program's efficient!",
