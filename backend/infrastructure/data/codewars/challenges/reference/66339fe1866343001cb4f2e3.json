    "description": "Bob *is struggling*. \n\nHe has exceeded the total amount of characters he could have used on a poster, and he cannot condense the text any further!\n\nBob came up with an idea! You know how some really long words on posters, such as \"international,\" condense down to \"int'l.\" So he wants to use this method, but also doesn't want to painstakingly condense *EVERY SINGLE LONG WORD*.\n\nBob asks you to write a script that does this for him.\n\n**Here's what we are doing:**\n\nCondense a word that is over 6 letters (letters as in the alphabet, lowercase/uppercase, you will need to filter out the non-alphabet characters in a word when calculating the length) long, \"condensing\" a word is taking the first 3 letters, adding an apostrophe, and finishing with the last letter. Any punctuation (the ones being tested are the period [.], the comma [,] exclamation mark [!], question mark [?], colon [:], and the semicolon [;]) other than the previously mentioned apostrophe should not be included; however, the capitalization and punctuation of the whole text must stay the same. There will be no invalid inputs.",
