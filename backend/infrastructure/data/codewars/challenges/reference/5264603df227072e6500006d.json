    "description": "In this kata we mix some tasty fruit juice. We can add some components with certain amounts. Sometimes we pour out a bit of our juice. Then we want to find out, which concentrations our fruit juice has.\n\nExample:\n\n* You take an empty jar for your juice\n* Whenever the jar is empty, the concentrations are always 0\n* Now you add 200 units of apple juice\n* And then you add 200 units of banana juice\n* Now the concentration of apple juice is 0.5 (50%)\n* Then you pour out 200 units\n* The concentration of apple juice is still 50%\n* Then you add 200 units of apple juice again\n* Now the concentration of apple juice is 0.75, while the concentration of banana juice is only 0.25 (300 units apple juice + 100 units banana juice)\n\nComplete the functions in order to provide this functionality. The test code for the example above can be found in the test fixture.",
