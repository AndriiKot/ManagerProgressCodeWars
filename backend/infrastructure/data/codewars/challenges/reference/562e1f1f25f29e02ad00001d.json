    "description": "Find the probablity of two randomly selected natural numbers, 1 through N, will be relatively prime. The answer will be a decimal rounded to the thousandth place.\n\nFor example if N were 3, you would have nine equaprobable events:\n```javascript\n1,1   1,2   1,3\n2,1   2,2   2,3\n3,1   3,2   3,3\n``` \n\nThe only two numbers in this set that are not coprime are 2,2 and 3,3 because their greatest common divisors are not 1. The probablity that two random numbers 1 through 3 is .778. \n\n(Coprime means that the only positive integer that evenly divides both of them is 1.)",
