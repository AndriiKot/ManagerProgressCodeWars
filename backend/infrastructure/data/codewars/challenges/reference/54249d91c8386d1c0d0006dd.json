    "description": "Implement a [re-entrant mutex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrant_mutex) class `RMutex` that has the following methods:\n\n- `acquire`: \n  - if the mutex is acquired by some other thread, wait until it is released\n  - if the mutex is free, acquire it and set the counter to 1\n  - if the mutex is already acquired by the current thread, increment the counter\n- `release`:\n  - if the mutex is not acquired by the current thread, raise an error\n  - if the mutex is acquired by the current thread, decrement the counter; if the counter reaches 0, release the mutex.\n- `counter`: get the current counter\n- `owner`: get the thread that is holding the mutex or `nil` if it is released\n\n\nInitially, the re-entrant mutex must be in the released state.\n\nThe following code illustrates the expected behavior:\n```\nmx = RMutex.new\n\nmx.owner # => nil\nmx.counter # => 0\n\nmx.acquire # => returns immediately, acquire, counter: 0 -> 1\nmx.acquire # => returns immediately, counter: 1 -> 2\n\nmx.owner # => Thread.current\nmx.counter # => 2\n\nmx.release # => counter: 2 -> 1\n\nmx.owner # => Thread.current\nmx.counter # => 1\n\nother_thread = Thread.new do \n  mx.acquire\n  puts \"Acquired\" \n  sleep 20 \n  mx.release\nend\nsleep 1\n# other_thread waits on the mutex\n\nmx.release # => counter: 1 -> 0, release\n# at this moment other_thread wakes up and prints \"Acquired\"\n\nmx.owner # => other_thread\nmx.counter # => 1\n\nmx.acquire # hangs, waiting until other_thread releases the mutex\n# after other_thread sleeps for 20 seconds, the execution of the current thread continues\n\n\n\n\n```",
