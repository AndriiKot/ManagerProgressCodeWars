    "description": "Bob is doing a jigsaw puzzle and begins to wonder to himself, given the following requirements what is the most negative and most positive differences between the number of inner pieces (pieces with no flat sides) and outer pieces (pieces with at least one flat side).\n\nYou will be given an integer value for the number of pieces, that is valid. For example 21, we know this must be 3x7 or 7x3 (does not matter which way). We will assume that unless there is no other option the side length will be more than 1.\n//Therefore the minimum and the maximum differences will be the same in this case. We will always have an integer answer for each of these.\nThe outpurt will be in the form of an array with the first item being the most negative difference and the second item being the most positive difference.\nThe output would be [-11, -11]\n\n\nOther examples are:\nn = 120 ==> [-120,40]\n\nn = 42 ==> [-42,-2]\n\nn = 105 ==> [-39,25]\n\n\nMinimum n = 1, this will give [-1,-1] as output.\nMaximum n = 10,000 \n\nYour job is to work out the differences, assume it is always rectangular or square.\n\nAll pieces have the same dimensions and fit into the one puzzle and assume they fit together perfectly and each piece is used exactly once.\n\nThank you for doing my (first) kata.\n\ni have now updated it to include random test ensuring that you have to write the algorithm properly.\n",
