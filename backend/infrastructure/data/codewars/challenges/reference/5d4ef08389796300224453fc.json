    "description": "We start with two structures already defined and preloaded, ```Point``` and ```Rectangle```:\n```rust\nstruct Point {\n    x: f64,\n    y: f64,\n}\n\nstruct Rectangle {\n    p1: Point,\n    p2: Point,\n}\n```\nYou must implement the trait ```PartialEq``` for ```Rectangle``` (for ```Point``` is already implemented). In this kata, we assume that two rectangles are equal if their lower-left and upper-right vertices are equal (they have the same coordinates).\n\nThen, you must implement the ```contains``` method. A rectangle contains another if its perimeter is outside the perimeter of the other.\n\nIf the two perimeters even only partially overlap, the method must return ```false```.\nHint:\n-----\nChanging the ```new``` method can make the solution easier.",
