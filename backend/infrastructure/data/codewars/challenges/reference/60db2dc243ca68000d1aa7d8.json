    "description": "<b>Overview</b>\n\nGiven a rectangular plane with size (n x m). There are N-sensors located at point <code>(x, y)</code>. \n\nFrom the point <code>(0,0)</code> at the moment 0 the laser ray is  released in direction of the point <code>(1,1)</code>. The ray enters the sensor located at new point exactly in one second. Thus the time necessarily for traveling between points <code>(1,1) -> (2,2)</code> equals to two.\n\nWhen the ray meets the wall it's reflected by the rule that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. If the ray reaches any of the corners, it immediately stops. In this case we consider corners as <code>(0,0) (n,m), (0,m) (0,n)</code>\n\n<b>Task</b>\n\nFor each sensor you have to determine the first moment of the time when the ray will pass through the point where it located. Notice that, there could be untouched sensors which the laser ray will never intersect with.\n\n<b>Examples</b>\n\nFirst sample test case covers 4x4 rectangle, so the ray will pass through points <code>(1,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,3) -> (4,4)</code>. Thus, it will stop at the last point after 4 seconds. \n\n<img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/VLY4sCGT/cwp.png\"/>\n\nSecond sample test case covers another 4x3 rectangle. The ray will pass the following points <code>(0, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (1, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 0) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (0, 4)</code>. Thus, the ray travels 12 seconds. \n\n<img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/7ZTnLn4x/cwpng.png\"/>\n\n<b>Note</b>\n<br>\n<span>&#183;</span>\n Size of the plane <code>(1<=n<=m<=1000)</code>\n<br>\n<span>&#183;</span>\n Coordinates of the sensors <code>(1<=x<=y<=m)</code>\n<br>\n<span>&#183;</span>\n The output should be returned as a string with comma separated values.\n<br>\n<span>&#183;</span>\n For the untouched sensors return -1.",
