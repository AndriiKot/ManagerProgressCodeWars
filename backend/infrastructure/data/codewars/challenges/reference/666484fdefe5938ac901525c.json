    "description": "# Task\nWrite function `read_file` that takes a file name in `str` format as an argument - for example `sample.txt`. Your function should read the file and return its content.\n\nFiles for sample test will be preloaded for you. Files for fixed and random tests will be created when test is running. This is simple version, no tricks. File will always exist. It will always be `.txt` file as well. Both examples are on sample test, so you can see test and expected result.  \n\n## Example 1\nFirst file in sample test is `sample.txt` and its content is `This is content of sample file` which needs to be returned as `str`.\n\n## Example 2\nFile will always exist, but can be empty. Second sampel file is `empty_file.txt` and is empty. In that case, you are expected to return `''` as empty `str`.\n\n## File kata serie\n\n\n1. [Working with txt files - simple](https://www.codewars.com/kata/666484fdefe5938ac901525c) - this kata\n\n2.
