    "description": "As a Hacker of the Rebels you have a very important mission.\nYou have successfully got into an imperial system but you need an important file from your FTP server to continue your mission. Unfortunately your access is limited, your source code must fit in only one line. \nYou can overwrite a class, named DarthVader, it has four methods wich will be called by the system:\n\n- where_is_padme() - Overwrite it to create a login method\n- i_am_your_father() - Overwrite it to get the list of the files on your server (LIST)\n- join_us_or_die(name) - Overwrite it to create a download method. It will have an argument wich is the filename. This download method must download a real file from a real FTP server! You don't need partial downloading because it is a small file.\n- you_were_right() - Overwrite it to quit from the server\n\nThe __init__ will have a parameter which is the address of your ftp server. Don't worry about the address, the system will give your server's address.\n\nUnfortunatelly you cannot use the eval and exec. \n\nHere you can read the documentation of the ftplib module:\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html",
