    "description": "You work in a intelligence agency and your job is to go through private messages and detect all the people who eat fries with mayonnaise (what an abomination!). You are given a nested array with the structure \n```python\n[[\"name\",\"messages\"],[\"name\",\"messages\"]...]\n```\nWrite a function that returns a string with all the people separated by a comma whose \"messages\" have the word \"mayo\" (either lower or upper case) anywhere near the word \"fries\" (\"near\" means there are 10 or fewer words inbetween) like this: ```\"James, John, Andrew\"```. A word is a series of characters separated by a whitespace from the rest of the string. \"Fries\" and \"mayo\" are always single words and not part of another \"words\" like \"Belfries\", \"mayor\", \"fries,\" or \"mayo?\" etc. Names should be ordered in the same way they can be found in the input array.\n\nIf no matches have been found return ```\"all good\"```",
