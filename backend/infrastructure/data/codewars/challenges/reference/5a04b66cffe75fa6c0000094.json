    "description": "# Composition\nComposition is one of the main benefits of using a functional approach. This kata is about implementing a `getIdsForVideosWithRatingHigherOrEqualThan()` which returns the ids of videos that have a rating above or equal the specified number (as the long name indicates). For your implementation, use the `filter()` and `map()` functions that we've seen in the preceding katas in a chain. \n\nNotice how clear and readable the expression has become: in fact, we could argue that it's even more readable than the extra long function name (especially with TypeScript lambdas)!\n\n*Composing* `filter()` and `map()` gives us a lot of expressive power. These higher-order functions let us express *what* data we want, leaving to the underlying implementation flexibility in terms of *how* queries are executed.\n\n## Note: Attribution\nThis kata is part of a series on functional programming in JS/TS. This series is an adaptation of the *Functional Programming in Javascript* online exercises: http://reactivex.io/learnrx/ (Apache 2 license).",
