    "description": "Tim loves to drive in the weekend rally championships. His teenage son Joey is a keen navigator, helping his dad from the passenger seat. \n\nLast weekend Joey cracked his watch when repairing a flat tyre on their rally car. Luckily, Joey found a digital minute counter in his dad's drawer just in time for the weekend's next round of racing. \n\nUnfortunately Joey isn't the best at maths and is worried about converting the 'minutes' to 'hours and minutes' (i.e 65 minutes to 1:05 hrs). \n\nCreate a function to help Joey convert the output from his minutes counter to Hrs:Min.",
