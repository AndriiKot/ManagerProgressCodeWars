    "description": "> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\n\n~ Parade Magazine\n\n\nThe answer is yes. If you switch, you increase your chances of receiving a car from `1/3` to `2/3`.\n\nWhat if we generalize the problem ?\nThere are initially `C + G` doors in total (`C` doors with cars behind them and `G` doors with goats behind them).\n\nYou choose a random door among them. Then, the host opens `OC` doors with cars behind them and `OG` doors with goats behind them (the host cannot open your chosen door).\n\nShould you switch to another closed door or stick to your initial choice ?\n\n___\nWrite a function that, given `C`, `G`, `OC` and `OG`, returns whether you should switch or not.\n\nReturn `True` if you should switch. Return `False` if you should not. If the probability is equal if you stay or switch, return `True`.\n\n\nPreconditions:\n* it is guaranteed that `OC ≤ C` and `OG ≤ G`.\n* the host will always leave at least 1 door closed, in addition to the initially chosen door, so there is always a choice to be made between switching and sticking (`OC + OG ≤ C + G - 2`).",
