    "description": "*Once upon a time you were lying in your bed and fell asleep. In your dream you arrived in a strange world full of jesters and tricksters. You couldn't bare all their mischievous actions and puzzles, therefore decided to wake up and return to the reality. But to escape this nightmare you have to do something unimaginable...*\n\n___\n\nYour task is to count the occurrences of each character in the input string `s`, storing the information in a dictionary `d`. Sounds pretty easy but...  \n\n* you should do this using no more than `30` characters  \n* you **can** actually timeout if your code is not efficient enough  \n* *Everything here is not what it seems...*",
