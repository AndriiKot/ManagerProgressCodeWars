    "description": "_Too few people recognize that the high technology so celebrated today is essentially a mathematical technology._\nEdsger Dijkstra\n\n<h3 style='color:#f88'>EXPLANATIONS</h3>\n\nThe integers ```64``` and ```729``` have an special property, they are both, perfect squares and cubic.\nIn effect:\n```\n8² = 64  and 4³ = 64\n27² = 729 and 9³ = 729\n```\nThe number ```64``` and  ```729```are the first values  of the sequence of _perfect squares and perfect cubic numbers_. The integer ```1``` will be considered trivial and it will not be counted.\n\n<h3 style='color:#f88'>THE TASK</h3>\n\nGiven an integer, ```N, N > 0```, you have to output the closest perfect square and cubic number but strictly higher than  ```N```.\nThe result should be expressed as ```modulo 12345787``` because we have results with many digits.\nWe put some examples of inputs and their corresponding output to understand the features of the function that that you have to create. \n```\nN (input)                               result(output)\n4                                        64\n5                                        64 \n728                                      729\n1000                                     4096\n4096                                     15625\n4000001                                  4826809\n5559917313492231480                      12234099\n```\n<h3 style='color:#f88'>THE TESTS</h3>\nYou have to pass 500 tests and the range for the value of N will be:\n\n2 ≤ N ≤ 1 × 10<sup>40</sup>\n \nPerformace and precision are key factors.\n\nYour suggestions, observations and eventual issues wills be welcome. Hope that you can enjoy this easy one.",
