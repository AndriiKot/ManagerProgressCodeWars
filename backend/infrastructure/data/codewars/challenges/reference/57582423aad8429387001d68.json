    "description": "Tesko supermarket is upgrading their checkouts! They want you to write a function that sorts customer's shopping items on the conveyor belt before they get packed. The goal is to make sure heavy items are packed first and fragile items last.\n\n<img style=\"width:500px\" src=\"http://www.businessmagnet.co.uk/manage-account/uploadedImages/131349/3.286-mts-wide-checkout-with-conveyor-belt.jpg\">\n\nThey have delcared 3 categories of items <i>(which include the following items ONLY)</i>:\n\nFruit: ```\"apple\"  \"banana\"  \"pear\"   ```  (light and soft, these must be moved to the end)\n\nDrink:``` \"beer\"  \"wine\"```   (heavy and strong, these must be moved to the front)\n\nOther: ``` \"anything else\" ``` \n\nYour function must move all drink items to the start of the array, maintaining their order of occurance and all fruit items to the end of the array, also maintaining the order of occurance. All other items should return in the same order.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n```javascript\n[\"apple\", \"chewinggum\", \"beer\", \"banana\", \"lip balm\", \"wine\"]   \n         \n                         sort...\n                           \n[\"beer\", \"wine\",  \"chewinggum\", \"lip balm\", \"apple\", \"banana\"]\n```\n\n<strong> NOTE:</strong> Just as the conveyor belt is only wide enough to hold one line of shopping, your function must manipulate the input array without using a transient array or object. Hence ```array.prototpe``` and ```object.prototype``` methods have been disabled.\n\n",
