    "description": "<h1>Green Glass Roof - Puzzles #6</h1>\nGreen glass roof, this kata is based on the puzzle of the green glass door see [This Kata](http://www.codewars.com/kata/green-glass-door/javascript). The main idea behind this kata is a more advanced version of the puzzle you will be given a sentence which you must then validate it to be a green glass roof (You will have to figure out what a green glass roof looks like from the test cases).\n\n<h2>Task</h2>\nYour task is to evaluate a string as being a Green Glass Roof, if it passes the set of rules defined by the puzzle you must return true else return false. This kata is strongly based on deciphering the test cases.",
