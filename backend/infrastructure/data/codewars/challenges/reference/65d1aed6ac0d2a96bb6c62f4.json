    "description": "Let's imagine that we are using a simple analog round clock that hangs on the wall of the room. But there is a small problem. The clock has only one hand (hour hand). Which only shows the degree of rotation. The clock does not have the usual time indications 1, 2, 3, etc.\n\nThe hour hand has turned **𝑑** degrees since the beginning of the day. Determine how many whole hours ℎ and whole minutes 𝑚 are now.\n\n### Input data\nThe input to the program is the number **𝑑 (0 ≤ 𝑑 < 360).**\n\n### Output\nYou enter a phrase on the screen:\n\n**This is... hours... minutes.** \n\n*Instead of ellipses, the program should output the values of ℎ and 𝑚, separating them from the words with exactly one space.*\n\n### Examples\n\n**input data**\n\n*90*\n\n**output**\n\n*It is 3 hours 0 minutes.*",
