    "description": "One way of thinking about `foldr` is that it replaces every data constructor with a given function or a value.\nHere is an example for a `list`:\n```haskell\nfoldr \n  :: (a -> b -> b) -- (:)\n  -> b             -- []\n  -> [a] \n  -> b \n  \nfoldr (+) 0 [1..5]\n==> (1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5 : []) \n==> (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 0) -- parentheses are omitted for clarity\n==> 15\n\n```\nSo let us implement folds for other data structures!\n\nNote 1: \nThere is an \"obvious\" law those folds should satisfy:\n```haskell\nfoldr (:) [] == id\nfold Cons1 Cons2 ... == id\n```\n\nNote 2:\nYou may be tempted to simply derive `Foldable` but that won't work.\nWhy? Because `Foldable` is a misnomer and what it does is destructively transforms your data structure to a list.\n\nNote 3:\nAll `fold`s should be as much general as they can be.\n\nNote 4:\nA nice paper on somewhat similar topic, and it's not that difficult to read!\nhttps://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf",
