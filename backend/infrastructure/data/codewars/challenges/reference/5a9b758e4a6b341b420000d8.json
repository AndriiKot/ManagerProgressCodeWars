    "description": "You will be given two points, A & B, that lie on the same plane (XY). Your goal is to find another point that lies on the line segment AB. That point must be a certain closeness to point A as it is to point B.\n\nA & B are arrays with the 0th index as the x-coordinate and the 1st being the y-coordinate.\nThe point that is returned should also be an array with the same format.\nExample:\n\n      Find a point on line segment AB that is twice as close to A as it is a           be. A(0,0) B(3,0)\n        function point([0,0], [3,0], 2){\n        \n        }\n          This should return [2,0]\n",
