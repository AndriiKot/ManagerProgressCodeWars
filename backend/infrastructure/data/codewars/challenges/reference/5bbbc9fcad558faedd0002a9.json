    "description": "Hello codewarrior #6257!\n\nYou were secretly selected to hack into secret governmental database. The only thing you will need is a password. In order to get it, you need to use the secret_function(). After you acquire the password RETURN it in order to proceed with your mission.\n\nGood luck the chosen ONE! If you get stuck, read your task again.\n\nThis message will self-destruct in thirty three seconds.\n\n\nAlert: this puzzle was created by my sick mind, so don't expect it to be too logical ;)",
