    "description": "\"The Indianapolis 500 is held annually at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a 2.5 mile oval circuit. Drivers race 200 laps, counterclockwise around the circuit, for a distance of 500 miles.\"\n\nYou are watching the race and you want to know the lap of a car.  All you have is a stopwatch.\n\nThe only issue here is that laps are measured by the average miles per hour.\n\nGiven the duration of a lap, define a method that will return the average miles per hour for that same lap.\n\n* Lap duration is a string.\n* Lap duration may have up to 4 decimal places.\n* The result should return a string with 3 decimal places and 'mph'.\n\nExample:\n```ruby\nmph('00:01:09.77')\n#Should return:\n'128.995 mph'\n```",
