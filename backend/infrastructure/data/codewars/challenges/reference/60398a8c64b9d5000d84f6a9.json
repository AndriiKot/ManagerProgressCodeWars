    "description": "Your job is to return the amount of metal needed to build the train.\nYou are given a string. The string will look something like this:\n\n```python\nstr = 'A________'\n```\n\nWhere the 'A' is a type of a locomotive and \"_ \" is a coach after the train. \n\nRULES:\n\nA = 15 pieces of metal\n\nB = 10 pieces of metal\n\nC = 7 pieces of metal\n\nD = 8 pieces of metal\n\nThe coaches take 5 pieces of metal to make(for each).\n\n###EXAMPLE###\n```python\ntrain('A_') = 20, 15 for A type, and 5 for coach\n```\n\nThe value is supposed to be an integer\n\nAnother example:\n\n```python\ntrain('B__') = 20, 10 for B type, and 10 for coaches(2 coaches, 5 pieces of metal each)\n```\n\nAll translations and edits welcome!",
