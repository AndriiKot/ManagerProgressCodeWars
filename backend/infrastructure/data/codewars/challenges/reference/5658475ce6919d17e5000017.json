    "description": "You are a first-time online publisher and would like to post your articles online. You want to build an archive which can store and update article information and enables \"likes\" from social networks.\n\nThe \"archive\" array will store an object for each article. Each object shall contain the following article info:\n\n- \"articleId\" - each article has its id. The 1st article has id 1, the 2nd id 2 and so on. The value must be an integer.\n- \"title\" - any string value.\n- \"filename\" - this value will store the filename where the article is stored, for example, 'path.txt'. The file should always have the \".txt\" extension. The filename will use the provided article \"title\" (previous field). Blank spaces in the title shall be replaced with \"_\", while the following characters shall be discarded in the filename:   (){}[]/\\.,;!?`+@%^#$£\n- \"likes\" - shows how many people have liked the article on each of the social networks in the \"networks\" array.\n\nPlease use the provided names for each info-field. \n\nYou should write the following functions:\n\n- \"article\" - a constructor which takes the \"title\" argument to create an article object with the above listed info, and add it to the archive. For example:\n\n```javascript\nnew article(\"Something, Something!\");\n//would return:\n{\n  articleId: 1,\n  title:\"Something, Something!\",\n  filename: \"Something_Something.txt\",\n  likes: {facebook:0,twitter:0,googlePlus:0}\n  }\n```\n\n- \"like\" - a function which takes the \"title\" and \"network\" arguments, and \"+1\"s the total social-netowork likes of that article. For example:\n```javascript\nlike(\"Something, Something!\",\"twitter\");\n//would return:\n{facebook:0,twitter:1,googlePlus:0}\n```\n\n- \"remove\" - a method which takes the \"title\" argument and removes the the article with such title from the archive. The other articles' id's will  be updated accordingly. For example, let's say we added a 2nd article named \"Fancy new article\" to our archive, and decided later to remove the previous article:\n```javascript\nremove(\"Something!, Something!\");\n//would return:\n[{\n  articleId: 1,\n  title:\"Fancy new article\",\n  filename: \"Fancy_new_article.txt\",\n  likes: {facebook:0,twitter:0,googlePlus:0}\n  }]\n```\n\nEnjoy!",
