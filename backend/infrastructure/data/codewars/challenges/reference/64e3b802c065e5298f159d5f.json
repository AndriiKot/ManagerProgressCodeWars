    "description": "Given an int ```towerHeight```, I need you to construct a tower whose base is ```towerHeight * 2 -1``` spaces long and ```towerHeight ^ 2``` is at the very top of the tower. Each space is made up of a power of 2, the left most bricks being 2 and gradually increasing by a power of 2 as you build up. \n\n\nFor example, \n\n```towerHeight = 1```:\n```\n2 // <-- 2^1 = 2\n```\n```towerHeight = 2```:\n```\n2\n24 // <-- 2^2 = 4\n2\n```\n```towerHeight = 3```:\n```\n2\n24\n248 // <-- 2^3 = 8\n24\n2\n```\n```towerHeight = 5```:\n```\n2\n24\n248\n24816\n2481632 // <-- 2^5 = 32\n24816\n248\n24\n2\n```\n```towerHeight = 8```:\n```\n2\n24\n248\n24816\n2481632\n248163264\n248163264128\n248163264128256 // <-- 2^8 = 256\n248163264128\n248163264\n2481632\n24816\n248\n24\n2\n```\n\n```towerHeight``` will be an positive int ranging from 0 to 60. Your task will be to construct the tower and return a ```String``` that contains the tower. Watch out for whitespace, there should be none of it on any of the lines, nor at the beginning or end. You'll only be making a String that contais numbers and new lines, ```\"\\n\"```.\n\nKeep in mind the max value of an ```int``` and that the tests will go up to 2^78 (Hint: you may want to use an object that can handle \"Big\" numbers.\n",
