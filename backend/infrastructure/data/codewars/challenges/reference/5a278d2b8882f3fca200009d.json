    "description": "One day, Mrs. Muffins bunnyhopped to the restaurant, Bunny Delights. When she got there, she realized that many of the labels on the food had the letters jumbled in the wrong order. This led her to think about how many different ways these letters could be arranged.\n\nMrs. Muffins sees you walking by, and asks for your help. She gives you a word, and asks for you the number of ways that word can be arranged. Can you help her out?",
