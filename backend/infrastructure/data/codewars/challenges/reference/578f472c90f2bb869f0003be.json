    "description": "Every year <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter\">Easter</a> is on a different date. \n\nCalculate Easter Sunday of a given year for the Gregorian calendar.\n\nSince the Gregorian calendar starts in 1582 and is accurate up until 4099 according to people who know more about this than me, this kata will test every year of that time span.\n\nDon't worry about wrong input. You are guaranteed to get a number n with 1582 <= n <= 4099.\n\nUse all the tools that are available to you. \n\n\nReference: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus#Theory\">Wikipedia</a>",
