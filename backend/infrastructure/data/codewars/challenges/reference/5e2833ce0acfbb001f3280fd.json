    "description": "Write a function that for integer N >= 0 and factors f finds the sum of all natural numbers smaller than N and divisible by at least one of the given factors.\n\nThis kata is a generalization of https://www.codewars.com/kata/514b92a657cdc65150000006, but with variable factors and large random test cases such that iterating over all numbers smaller than N is too slow.\n\nThe random testcases will have N in the range of 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 and will have 1 to 6 factors ranging from 1 to 30.\n",
