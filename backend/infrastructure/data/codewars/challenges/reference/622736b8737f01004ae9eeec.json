    "description": "<h1>socket server [client-side]</h1>\n\never worked with socket servers?<br>\nwell me neither!\n\n\n<h2>task</h2>\n\nYour task is to make a client side `socket` with host as `gethostname()` and port as `3000`.\n\nOnce you are connected to the server side, the sever will send data only **once** and will close.\n\nYou have to get the data of max 1024, `decode` the data and return it.\n\nAlso dont forget to close your `client side socket` or else you will timeout even after return.\n\nThere is only **one** test which is the random test and there is no example test, so you have to attempt every time sadly.",
