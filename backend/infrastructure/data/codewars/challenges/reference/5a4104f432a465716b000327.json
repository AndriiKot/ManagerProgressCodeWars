    "description": "The 196-algorithm takes a natural number and adds its reverse number to it. This is repeated until the result is a palindrome. Given a natural number n, write a function that returns the number of iterations needed for the 196-algorithm to terminate.\n\nFor example:\n```java\nf(1) = 0. Because 1 is already a palindrome.\nf(12) = 1. Because 12 + 21 = 33, which is a palindrome.\nf(59) = 3. Because 59 + 95 = 154. 154 + 451 = 605. 605 + 506 = 1111. This one took 3 iterations.\n```\n\n*The original 196-algorithm starts with at least 1 iteration, even if the first number is palindromic.*\n\nFor most numbers the algorithm terminates after only few iterations. However, for some numbers (like 196 and other <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number\">Lyrchel-numbers</a>) the algorithm does not terminate even after hundreds of millions of iterations. The proof that the algorithm does not terminate for this numbers has not been found yet. **So you need to make use of an upper bound.**\n\n```java\nIf the algorithm does not terminate after 30 iterations, return -1.\n```\n\n",
