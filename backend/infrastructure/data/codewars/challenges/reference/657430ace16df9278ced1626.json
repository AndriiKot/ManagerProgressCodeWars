    "description": "<H1>Alkane Validator</H1>\n\n<H3>Background</H3>\n\nAlkanes are a family of organic molecules made up of Carbon and Hydrogen atoms.  \n\nEach Carbon atom must bond with 4 other atoms.  \nEach Hydrogen atom must bond to 1 Carbon atom.  \nAlkanes can not have any double bonds.  \n\nThe smallest Alkane is Methane.  It is 1 Carbon atom bonded to 4 Hydrogen atoms.  It can be represented by the molecular formula CH4.  \n\nThe next Alkane is Ethane. It is 2 Carbon atoms bonded to 6 Hydrogen atoms.  It can be represented by the molecular formula C2H6.  \n\nAn Alkane with N Carbon Atoms will have (2N + 2) Hydrogen Atoms.  \n<H3>Task</H3>\n\nYour task is to write a function that will return true or false depending on whether a valid molecular formula for an Alkane has been passed in as a string.  \n<H4>Constraints</H4>\n<UL>\n<LI>The formula must start with the number of Carbon atoms first</LI>\n<LI>There is no limit to the number of carbon atoms that can be linked together</LI>\n<LI>The molecule must follow the rule C(n)H(2n + 2)\n<LI>Methane is a special case and has the molecular formula CH4 (we don't bother to write the 1 next to the Carbon atom)</LI>\n<LI>The C and H must be uppercase</LI>\n</UL>",
