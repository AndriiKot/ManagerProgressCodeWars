    "description": "The illuminati is a secret society that operates in the dark.\nMost of their staff are old dinosaures, this is where you come in!\nYou are the new initiate that has just been recuited by The illuminati.\n\nLooking for new ways to expand they're presence secretly, they put you in charge of inserting their\n\"secret\" symbol into multimedia.\n\nWhat you have to do is no mere easy task.\n\nCreate a function that will draw a triangle.\n\n### Task\n\n* the function takes in a `integer` that will define the height of the triangle's output.\n* That `return` the triangle as a `string`.\n* The triangle has to be constituted of small `o`.\n* If the passed paramater is not a positive integer, return a string `\"illuminati is fake\"`.\n* The returned string must contain spaces `\" \"` in hollow around the `o` except for the base.\n* Each line must contain a new line `\\n` except for the base. \n  (so that anyone else trying to you use it can't trace it back to the secret society)\n\n\n  `TriangleGen(3)` will return a string containing the following:\n  \n```  \n   o  \n  ooo \n ooooo\n```",
