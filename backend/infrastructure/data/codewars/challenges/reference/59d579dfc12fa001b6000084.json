    "description": "## Beta Kata\nThank you for trying this beta kata. Once you've completed it, please rate how satisfied you are with this kata and rank it. Katas can only get out of beta if they are rated very satisfied. If you don't give it a very satisfied rating, share your reasons for keeping the kata in beta in a comment as a suggestion or issue. Once the suggestion or issue is resolved, please re-rate as very satisfied. Note that a kata that is _too easy_ or _too hard_ should not be given a lower satisfaction rating, but given a kyu ranking that matches the kata's difficulty. This kata, in particular, is meant to teach some basics about the R language, so please don't downvote because you think it is too easy or a duplicate.\n\n## Find the longest element\nGiven a character vector, s, find the elements of that character vector that have the most characters.\n\n\nIn the event of a tie, return a character vector with each element in the tie, in the same order as they were in the original character vector. \n\n## Examples\n```r\nlongest(c(\"Hello\", \"world!\"))\n[1] \"world!\"\n\nlongest(c(\"Hello\", \"world\"))\n[1] \"Hello\" \"world\"\n\nlongest(\"\")\n[1] \"\"\n```",
