    "description": "Given the hours and minutes of a current time, calculate the angle between the clock hands. Keep in mind that hours hand also move slightly depending on the minutes (1:30 puts the hours hand exactly in the middle between 1 and 2).\nThe angle starts on the hours hand, and is counted clockwise to the minutes hand.\nInputs are hours and minutes as integers.\nHours must be between 1 and 23, and minutes between 0 and 59.\nIt's guaranteed that inputs are going to be always as described so no further validations are required.",
