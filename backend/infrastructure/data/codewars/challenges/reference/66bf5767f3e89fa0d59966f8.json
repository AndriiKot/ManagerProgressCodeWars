    "description": "# Count the Snacks on Each Box\nEvery week, Mike, the manager, orders a few boxes of snacks for all the employees in the office. Each box contains a random number of snacks because the suppliers pack them differently each time 😥. Additionally, the number of employees on each floor can vary depending on the day of the week.\n\n## Task:\nYou are given two arrays:\n\nSnacks per Box: An array where each element represents the number of snacks in a specific box.\n\nExample: [3, 4, 5]\nThis means we have 3 boxes: the first box contains 3 snacks, the second box contains 4 snacks, and the third box contains 5 snacks.\n\nEmployees per Floor: An array where each element represents the number of employees on a specific floor.\n\nExample: [5, 6, 3]\nThis means we have 3 floors: the first floor has 5 employees, the second floor has 6 employees, and the third floor has 3 employees.\n\n## Objective:\nWrite a function that determines if there are enough snacks for all employees.\n\n## Requirements:\nThe function should return a boolean:\n`true` if the total number of snacks is equal to or greater than the total number of employees.\n`false` if there are fewer snacks than employees.",
