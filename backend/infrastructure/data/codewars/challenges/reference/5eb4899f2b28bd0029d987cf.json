    "description": "The Mean Average Deviation (MAD) is a math concept which is taught before Standard Deviation and then mostly forgotten. Like a standard deviation, the MAD is a value which shows the variability or spread for a dataset around the mean.\n\nThe steps to calculate the MAD are as follows:\n\n    Determine the average\n\n    For each datapoint determine the distance from the average.\n\n    Sum all of the distances\n\n    Take an average of the sum\n\nFor instance for the followings datasets:\n\n(2,2,4,4) has an Average of 3 and a MAD of 1\n\n(1,1,4,6) has an Average of 3 and a MAD of 2\n\nTherefore the data in the second dataset is more spread out.\n\nWrite a function to calculate the Mean Average Deviation of a dataset of arbitrary length.",
