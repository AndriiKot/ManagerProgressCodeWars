    "description": "In this Kata we are going to model a Rubik's cube and evaluate the final state\nof the cube after a given sequence of moves.\n\nTo do this you will implement an execute() function which takes an initial state and \nmove sequence as arguments and returns the resulting state:\n\n```javascript\nfunction execute(state, sequence) {\n  // your code here\n  return state;\n}\n```\n\nThe arguments are defined as follows:\n\n* state: a string containing comma separated face definitions in the order Up, Front, Left, Back, Right and Down\n  * Each face definition is given by 9 characters representing the state of each square on the face\n  * The 9 characters are organised on each face as per Fig.1 below\n  * The faces are oriented for mapping as per Fig.2 below\n  * The characters often represent colours (e.g. White, Green, Orange, Blue, Red, Yellow) but could be anything. However they will be consistent, having 6 distinct characters and 9 of each one\n  * E.g. \"WWWWWWWWW,GGGGGGGGG,OOOOOOOOO,BBBBBBBBB,RRRRRRRRR,YYYYYYYYY\"\n* sequence: a string in simple Rubik's Cube notation. The faces are identified by their initial letters U, F, L, B, R, D\n  * The letters are always upper case.\n  * A letter on its own specifies a 90 degree clockwise turn.\n  * If the number 2 follows the letter, it is a double turn, or 180 degrees.\n  * If a single quote (') follows the letter, it is a 90 degrees anticlockwise turn.\n  * There are no delimiters, spaces, or other characters\n  * E.g. \"RUD'F2\"\n\nFig. 1 - Character Mapping on a Face\n```\n+---------+\n| 0  1  2 |\n|         |\n| 3  4  5 |\n|         |\n| 6  7  8 |\n+---------+\n```\n\n\nFig. 2 - Face orientations for mapping the cube state string\n```\n                  +--------+\n                  |        |\n                  |   Up   |\n                  |        |\n+--------+--------+--------+--------+\n|        |        |        |        |\n|  Back  |  Left  |  Front |  Right |\n|        |        |        |        |\n+--------+--------+--------+--------+\n                  |        |\n                  |  Down  |\n                  |        |\n                  +--------+\n```",
