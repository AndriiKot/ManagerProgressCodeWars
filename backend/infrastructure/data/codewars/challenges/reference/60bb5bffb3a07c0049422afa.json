    "description": "The 'Digit Divider Riddle' is as the name says a riddle. It was invented by Lea Gorodisky in 1978.\nThe task is to find an integer that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1 The number may only contain a digit once\n2 The first x digits must be dividable by x\n    \n  examples: \n    \n    123 => 1/1 = 1; 12/2 = 6; 123/3 = 41;  correct\n    456... => 4/1 = 4; 45/2 = 22.5; 456/6 = 76;  wrong, because 45/2 has remainder\n    123654 => 1/1 = 1; 12/2 = 6; 123/3 = 41; 1236/4 = 309; 12365/5 = 2473; 123654/6 = 20609;  correct\n    \n\nInfo:\n  In the original riddle, the number system used was the decimal system.\n  You have to find a number, for the number system n.\n  n can be higher than 10, and can not be smaller than 2.\n  The digit 0 is not allowed.\n  Return your results as an array of Strings. The array must be sorted lowest to highest.\n  Note, that if there is no result for a specific number system, return an empty array.\n  \nExamples:\n\n  n=10: 381654729\n  n=14: 9c3a5476b812d\n  \nHave Fun!",
