Your job is to write the function to find the exit.\n\n<h3 class=\"mtn\">GameMap:</h3>\n\nWe have THREE levels and each level will be a 3x3 maze.\n\nIn the maze,\n</br>`'O'` means the path you must follow. \n</br>`'X'` means a place you cannot enter.\n\nThe starting point will be given as an array `[x,y]`, for example `[0,1]` if the start is at position (0,1) (The first row with second column)\n\n<h3 class=\"mtn\">Example:</h3>\n\n`[0,1]` is the starting point and below the mazes are given.\n\n<h4>gameMap1</h4>\nplayer starts from [0,1] to [2,1], we got [2,1] to next level\n\n`[['X','O','X'],`\n`['X','O','X'],`\n`['X','O','X']]`\n\n<h4>gameMap2</h4>\nplayer start from [2,1] to [0,2], we got [0,2] to next level\n\n`[['X','X','O'],`\n`['X','X','O'],`\n`['X','O','O']]`\n\n<h4>gameMap3</h4>\nplayer start from [0,2] to [1,0], we got [1,0] as the final exit\n\n`[['X','O','O'],`\n`['O','O','X'],`\n`['X','X','X']]`",
