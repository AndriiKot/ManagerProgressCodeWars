    "description": "You know how sometimes you write the the same word twice in a sentence, but then don't notice that it happened? For example, you've been distracted for a second. Did you notice that _\"the\"_ is doubled in the first sentence of this description?\n\nAs as aS you can see, it's not easy to spot those errors, especially if words differ in case, like _\"as\"_ at the beginning of this sentence.\n\nWrite a function that counts the number of sections repeating the same word (case insensitive). The occurence of two or more equal words next after each other counts as one.\n\n## Examples\n```\n\"dog cat\"                  -->  0\n\"dog DOG cat\"              -->  1\n\"apple dog cat\"            -->  0\n\"pineapple apple dog cat\"  -->  0\n\"apple apple dog cat\"      -->  1\n\"apple dog apple dog cat\"  -->  0\n\"dog dog DOG dog dog dog\"  -->  1\n\"dog dog dog dog cat cat\"  -->  2\n\"cat cat dog dog cat cat\"  -->  3\n```",
