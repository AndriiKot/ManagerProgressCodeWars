    "description": "\n## A Previous Kata\n\nThis is a **variation** of a [previous kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/65d81be5ac0d2ade3a6c637b) of mine. I recommend you check it out to get familiar with the concept, then come back to this one.\n\nThe story is also a follow up, though it is just as nonsensical whether you read the previous one or not. It got a bit **longer than usual** this time, so there **no shame in skipping it this time**.\n\n## Introduction\n\nUsing the divine power granted to him, *Julius Caesar* emerges victorious over the formidable *Khan*, bringing the entirety of Asia under Roman rule. With his triumph secured, Caesar redirects his attention to the affairs of his homeland.\n\nHowever, in his absence, a grave error occurs: the capital of Rome is left vulnerable and undefended. Seizing this opportunity, *Hitler* launches a ruthless campaign, swiftly conquering Europe and unleashing unimaginable devastation upon the Roman populace.\n\nEnraged by this heinous act, Caesar vows vengeance on a grand scale. Yet, faced with the overwhelming technological superiority of the Nazis' guns and tanks, the Roman forces find themselves at a significant disadvantage.\n\nIn this dire moment, divine intervention strikes once again. The heavens could not tolerate the tyranny of such a brutal dictator running rampant across Europe.\n\nEmpowered by this intervention, Caesar's army undergoes a miraculous transformation. Each soldier's strength, originally ranging from `1` to `n`, is now magnified `n` times over. Thus, for every level of strength, there are now `n` warriors.\n\nAdditionally, Caesar is presented with a unique opportunity: the chance to create a new army. Each new warrior in this army would possess skills obtained through the **XOR** combination of two other soldiers' abilities. This process would be repeated for every possible pairing of soldiers, resulting in an army of equal size to the original.\n\nNow faced with the task of determining the potential superiority of this new army, Caesar must calculate its total strength. Time is of the essence; even divine beings cannot afford to delay justice against Hitler's regime.\n\n## Task\n\nGiven a **positive integer** `n`, return `$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} i \\wedge j$`, where `$\\wedge$` is the **Bitwise XOR** operation (I know that's not the proper symbol, I couldn't get the right one to work).\n\n## Performance\n\n**Brute force** solutions, yielding a time complexity of `O(n ^ 2)`, won't work.\n\nThe **expected** time complexity is `O(logn)`. Most solutions with a time complexity **equal or close** to that should pass **with ease**.\n\n```python\nRandom Tests: 100\nInteger Size: 1 to 10 ** 100\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\n1 -> 0\n2 -> 6\n3 -> 12\n4 -> 48\n10 -> 678\n100 -> 602352\n```",
