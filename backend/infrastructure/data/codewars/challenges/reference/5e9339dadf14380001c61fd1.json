    "description": "A new virus attacks marsians. They ask Earth scientists how long will pandemy last on their planet. The overall ammount of their population is Y and there are already X infected among them. Silly marsians don't stick to quarantine and continue to hang out with each other, which makes it easier for the virus to spread. Every day each infected marsian spreads the disease to N other healthy marsians. Luckily the virus is not lethal and it takes D days for an infected marsian to recover. After that he becomes immune to the virus and doesn't infect others.\n\nYour job is to determine how many days will pass until there are no infected on the planet.\n\nExample:\n\nX = 1, Y = 5, N = 1, D = 3\n\nDay 0: 1 infected / 4 healthy / 0 recovered\n\nDay 1: 2 infected / 3 healthy / 0 recovered\n\nDay 2: 4 infected / 1 healthy / 0 recovered\n\nDay 3: 4 infected / 0 healthy / 1 recovered\n\nDay 4: 3 infected / 0 healthy / 2 recovered\n\nDay 5: 1 infected / 0 healthy / 4 recovered\n\nDay 6: 0 infected / 0 healthy / 5 recovered\n\nThe answer is 6 days.\n\nPlease note that some of the variables can be 0 and X will always be not greater than Y.\n\n",
