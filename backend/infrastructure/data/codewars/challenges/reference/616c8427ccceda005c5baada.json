    "description": "When dividing numbers, sometimes the answer is simple. For example:<br/>\n1/2=0.5<br/>\nHowever, sometimes the answer has infinite digits after the decimal point, such as:<br/>\n1/3=0.3 repeating<br/>\nWhile this is perfectly understandable, sometimes the infinite digits take a while to start, so by surrounding the repeating digits in parentheses, the value is made more clear:<br/>\n1/6=0.1(6)<br/>\nFinally, division can also result in irrational numbers, in which case we may as well give 1000 digits after the decimal place, truncated because I'm lazy. I won't bother to put an example because it would scare you ;)\n\n<p>Also, since I am extremely cruel, you should be able to handle ANY type of Object I throw at you and assume that it has a String representation that is numeric. If it doesn't have that, then return null. I also threw in other weird test cases, so use those print statements!</p>",
