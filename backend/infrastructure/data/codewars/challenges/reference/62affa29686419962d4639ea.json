    "description": "OBJECTIVE:\n* Compute the winner of a game of cornhole, which involves two teams/players throwing bags of corn at a hole in a board.\n\nRULES:\n* Each team has four bags per round. \n\n* There are three possible scores per bag: 0 (bag misses), 1 (bag lands on board), or 3 (bag passes through hole). \n\n* The first team to reach exactly 21 points wins. \n\n* Scoring is via \"cancellation\"; e.g., if one team scores 5 points in a round, and the other team scores 9, then the second team receives four points for the round (i.e. 9-5=4).\n\nINPUT: \n\n* You will receive the scores for each team in a list of arrays that should contain four-digit integers made of 0s, 1s, and 3s.  This represents the score for each of the for bags per round.  (But there could be scoring errors--see below.)\n\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n* Three possiblities:\n  - 'A' if team A wins,\n  - 'B' if team B wins, or \n  - 'E' if there is a scoring error.\n\n* For 'E', an erroneous score could be:\n  - Neither team scores exactly 21.\n  - A score other than 0, 1, or 3 for any given throw.\n  - An improper number of throws per round (must be 4 per team).\n\nEXAMPLE:\n  * Input:\n\n    * Team A -->    \n    [ [3,3,1,0], [0,0,1,1], [1,3,0,1], [3,3,3,3], [1,3,3,1] ,[0,0,0,1], [3,1,3,0] ]\n    \n    * Team B -->  \n    [ [3,3,3,1], [0,0,3,1], [3,3,3,0], [1,3,3,3], [3,1,1,0], [3,3,3,3], [3,3,1,1] ]\n\n* Scores for each round (A-B): 0-3,0-5,0-9,2-9,5-9,5-20,5-21\n\n* Output: 'B' (because B reached 21 points).",
