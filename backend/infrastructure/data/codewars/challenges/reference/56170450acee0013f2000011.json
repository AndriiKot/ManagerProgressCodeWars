    "description": "When given a sorted array of objects, each of which has a 'value' property, like so:\n\ndemo = [{value:0},{value:10},{value:11}]\n\nand one wishes to insert a new corresponding object into this array, while preserving the sorted nature of it, one might simply\n\ndemo.push({value:8});<br/>\ndemo.sort(function(a,b){return a.value > b.value});\n\nHowever, this is a very inefficient method on larger lists. Instead, you should write a method that performs a binary insertion. \n\nThe way this works is the following:\n\nWhen I am looking for someone named \"Oprah\" in an alphabetically sorted list of names, I might open it up to the middle. Upon seeing that I'm in the M's, I would then check halfway between my current position and the end. There, I might land in the T's. So I would check halfway between my current position and the middle.\n\nAnd so on, until I find the name I'm looking for.\n\nWrite a function that works this way. The test case given to you is the only type of test case you'll have; you won't need to sort strings, and they will always be object with a value property.\n",
