    "description": "You are Chief Commissioning Editor at a broadcaster who approved the production of a low-budget televisual feast, ‘Inner-City Sumo’. \n\nBroadcast live from a pub carpark in Norwich, England, contestants must throw each other out of a ring that has been drawn on the ground with chalk.\n\nHowever, it has come to light that the Inner-City Sumo matches are part of a betting scam; a subtle lubricant has been applied to the tarmac on the east side of the ring and the advantage from the tachi-ai, or initial charge, is inevitably gained by the contestant on the opposite side.\n\nIn an effort to disrupt the betting scam without ‘causing a fuss’, you had to think quickly and have decided to swap the starting position of contestants for every other match.\n\nYou will be given an array that contains zero or more arrays of Inner-City Sumo matches. Each match is represented by its two contestants: C1 and C2. To swap the starting position of the contestants, you must return an array with their positions swapped as follows:\n\n[[‘C1’, ‘C2’], [‘C1’, ‘C2’], [‘C1’, ‘C2’], [‘C1’, ‘C2’]]\nshould return\n[[‘C1’, ‘C2’], [‘C2’, ‘C1’], [‘C1’, ‘C2’], [‘C2’, ‘C1’]]\n\nIf the passed-in array contains just one Inner-City Sumo match, the contestants should not be swapped. If the array is empty, an empty array should be returned.\n",
