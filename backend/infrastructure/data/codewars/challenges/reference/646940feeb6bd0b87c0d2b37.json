    "description": "The manager of a team needs to organize the on-call schedule taking into account the vacations of each member and the following criteria:\n\n- If a member has vacation for a week, he will not be able to be on call that same week, neither the one before nor the one after.\n- The members have a pre-established initial order and they have to rotate respecting it. \n- If a member couldn't be on-call on his turn because of his vacation, the next available member would. \n- When a member is assigned on-call for a week, that member will move to the end of the rotation. \n\nImplement an algorithm that constructs an on-call calendar given a list of TeamMember records and an integer representing the number of weeks in the calendar. \n\n```\n    /**\n     * Record containing team member information.\n     * @param name The name of the member.\n     * @param order The order in the on-call schedule.\n     * @param vacationWeeks The vacation weeks represented as an integer from 1 to the number of weeks.\n     */\n    public record TeamMember(String name, int order, Set<Integer> vacationWeeks) {}\n```\n\nThe output object will be a map with the week number as key and the name of the assigned member as value. If it is impossible to allocate a member for a week, null will be set as value.\n\nExample:\n```\nINPUT = [\nTeamMember[name=Jesús, order=1, vacationWeeks=[5, 10]], \nTeamMember[name=Víctor H., order=2, vacationWeeks=[5, 6]], \nTeamMember[name=Antonio, order=3, vacationWeeks=[2, 4]], \nTeamMember[name=Víctor C., order=4, vacationWeeks=[2, 3]], \nTeamMember[name=David, order=5, vacationWeeks=[3, 7]], \nTeamMember[name=Cristina, order=6, vacationWeeks=[7, 9]], \nTeamMember[name=Robert, order=7, vacationWeeks=[4, 7]]\n]\n\nOUTPUT = {1=Jesús, 2=Víctor H., 3=Cristina, 4=Cristina, 5=Víctor C., 6=Antonio, 7=Jesús, 8=Víctor H., 9=David, 10=Robert}\n```",
