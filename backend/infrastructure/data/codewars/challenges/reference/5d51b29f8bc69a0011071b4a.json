    "description": "You like listening to music at the office.\nYou frequently have to change the volume in your headphones thanks to your talkative coworkers, and you find yourself using the + and - on your keyboard to do so.\n\nThe keys increase and decrease the volume by 2 with each keystroke.\nThere's just one problem- you prefer numbers that are divisible by 3.\n\nYour coworkers are being loud- *increase* the volume to drown them out!\n\n----------------------------\n\nWrite a function that takes in current volume and outputs how many times you will have to press the + key on your keyboard to *increase the volue* and make it a number that is divisible by three.\n\nThe music should still be audible (0 and below are not going to work well at drowning out your coworkers.)\n\n(ex: volume = 4 : output = 1, one key press would take you to 6 by adding 2 to volume- 6 is divisible by 3)",
