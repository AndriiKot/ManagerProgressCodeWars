    "description": "Dice throwing is one of the first things that probability classes study. This is because besides tossing coins, dice are arguably the easiest way to understand probability. Before getting to more complicated topics, its often best to start with the basics. Understanding the odds from rolling two dice is a good way to step into binomial distributions, and other, more complicated distributions.\n\nAssuming each die is fair, each side has a 1 in 6 chance of being on top after a die roll. When it comes to rolling two dice, the numbers change a little bit. Not every number has the same chance of being rolled. For example, a 2 requires two ones, which means that it has a 1/6 * 1/6 or 1/36 chance of occurring. For some numbers, like a 5, there are multiple possible ways to get there, such as a 1 and a 4, or a 2 and a 3.\n\nProblem: Given a number, determine the likelihood that someone will roll that number with two dice. Output the answer as a reduced fraction, like \"1/6\" or \"5/36\". If the number is outside of the possible dice roll range, output \"Not possible\".",
