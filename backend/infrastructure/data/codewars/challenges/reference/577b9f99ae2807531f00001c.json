    "description": "Lodash is a very useful JavaScript library. The problem is that developers tend to rely on it for everything. This kata is designed to show you that you might not need lodash for your project.\n\nYou will create three wrapper functions for the native JavaScript array methods `map`, `reduce` and `filter`. The purpose of these functions is to check if the first argument is an array and if the second argument is a callback function. If not then the functions should return an empty array. `reduce` accepts an optional third argument - the initial value. If the initial value is not defined then it is set to be the first element of the array and the callback function will be executed starting at the array element with the index 1. In this case the array must be not empty - if it is empty `reduce` should return an empty array.\n\nGood luck!",
