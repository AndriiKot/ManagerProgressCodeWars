    "description": "Bill Gates currently resides in Washington state as a technology advisor to the Microsoft Corporation. He didn't get to where he was without many years of practice. One of the first computer programs that Gates wrote in his youth was a calculator that calculated the percentage of a number.\n\nAs someone who is a Bill Gates enthusiast, you want to write a function to mimic this calculator.
