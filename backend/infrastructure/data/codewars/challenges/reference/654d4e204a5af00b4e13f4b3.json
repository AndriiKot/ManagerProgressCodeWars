    "description": "## Basic Neural Network Implementation\n\nYour challenge is to develop a `SimpleNeuralNetwork` class capable of learning through training epochs. This task will test your understanding of neural networks and machine learning fundamentals.\n  \n# Task 1: Simple Neural Network\nImplement the `SimpleNeuralNetwork` class with the following methods:\n\n- `__init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):` Initializes the network with random weights and biases.\n- `train(self, inputs, labels, epochs, learning_rate):` Trains the network over a specified number of epochs and learning rate.\n- `calculate_loss(self, inputs, labels):` Computes the loss between the predictions and the actual labels.\n- `predict(self, inputs):` Predicts the output for given inputs.\n- `forward_pass(self, inputs):` Performs a forward pass through the network.\n\nThe network should demonstrate learning by reducing loss across epochs and adjusting its weights and biases accordingly.\n\n# Test Cases\nYour code will be evaluated against a suite of test cases. The neural network must exhibit a reduction in loss after training and show changes in its internal parameters. It should also handle various input scenarios effectively.\n\n# Requirements\n- Use the provided class structure for the neural network.\n- Ensure that the network functions as expected and passes all the test cases.\n",
