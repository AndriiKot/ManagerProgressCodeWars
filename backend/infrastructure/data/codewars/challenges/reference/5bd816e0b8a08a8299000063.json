    "description": "# Tap into Reivhax's robot\nThis priciple behind this kata is quite similar to the [mxyxinjin's serie's by Voile][1] where you try to recover a secret from a login function.\n\nReivhax made for himself an encryption server that recieves input, concats a secret to it then encrypts it. He accidentally made a mistake though, can you spot it and recover the secret before time runs out.\n\n# Your task\nYou are given a function that encrypts any text you give it, you are sure that it does not do so securely. Write a function `heimdall` that will recover a secret from the function.\n\nIt has to do so fast enough before your code times out. (Recover over 1024 secrets in under `12 seconds`)\n\n# Footnote\nSecrets will always be 64 characters long and represented as lowercase hexadecimal strings. (`0-f`)\n\nRead up on aes ecb. \n\n[1]:https://www.codewars.com/kata/59ae7edbba7b60c17500006e",
