    "description": "# Task\nCreate a function that accepts two arguments: a list `lst` and a number `n`. The function should return a list containing the sum of each of its contiguous slices. Slices in the list are comprised of consecutive values that, when summed, do not exceed a maximum of `n`. \n\nIt's important that no slice's cumulative sum surpasses the value of `n`. However, if an individual integer within the list is equal to or greater than `n`, it should also be included in the result.\n\n# Examples\n```python\nsum_of_slices([10, 29, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 31, 20, 10, 29, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 31, 20, 100], 100)\n➞ [97, 78, 87, 68, 100]\n\n# First slice: [10, 29, 13, 14, 15, 16]\n# 10 + 29 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 = 97\n# The next value could not be included in this slice because\n# the total would exceed 100.\n\n# Second slice: [17, 31, 20, 10]\n# 17 + 31 + 20 + 10 = 78\n# The next value could not be included in this slice because\n# the total would exceed 100.\n\n# And so on ...\n\nsum_of_slices([58, 3, 38, 9, 140], 140) ➞ [108, 140]\n# First slice: [58, 3, 38, 9]\n# 58 + 3 + 38 + 9 = 108\n\n# Second slice: [140]\n\nsum_of_slices([13], 10) ➞ [13]\n\nsum_of_slices([15], 1) ➞ [15]\n```\n# Notes\n- Do not sort the list.\n- n > 0 and min(lst) > 0\n",
