    "description": "#Amount to Coins - Universal\n\n`amountToCoin(amount, levels)` takes two arguments, first the `amount` as an integer, second the `levels` of coins as an **array**(for Euro that would be `[500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1]` for example. The array of levels will start with the highest level and end with the smallest.\n\nThe function should always use the highest levels possible, this means that even if lower levels allow for less total coins, it should still take the highest coin as long as the remainder will still be solvable.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* `amountToCoins(60, [50, 20, 1])` should use the `50` once and then solve the remainder with `1`s so the return would be `{50: 1, 20: 0, 1: 10}`.\n\n* `amountToCoins(26, [10, 5, 2, 1])` should return `{10: 2, 5: 1, 2: 0, 1: 1}` and not `{10: 0, 5: 5, 2: 0, 1: 1}`.\n\n* `amountToCoins(151, [5, 2])` should return `{5: 29, 2: 3}`. \n\nAs you can see the return value should be an object, containing a property for each level and how many times that level is used, for those that have not been used, the propery should still be there with `2: 0` for example.\n\nIf the amount can not be divided among the levels such that the remainder is `0` then the function should return `null`.\n\n_Hint: Always make sure that the amount cannot be divided among the levels in some way before you return null_\n",
