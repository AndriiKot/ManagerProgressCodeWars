    "description": "## Backstory\n\nThis problem is based on a former kata:\n\nhttps://www.codewars.com/kata/514b92a657cdc65150000006\n\nA friend of mine was complaining about this kata is being too easy, and should have a white rank instead of a yellow one. He was preparing for an interview, and felt like he need a more challenging task. Let's help him!\n\nIf you read the task of this kata, and think this is still too easy for you, here is a more challenging version of this kata:\n\nhttps://www.codewars.com/kata/62e66bea9db63bab88f4098c\n\n## The task\n\nAs mentioned in the original description:\n\n\"If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.\n\nFinish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.\"\n\nSeems easy, right? What if I tell you that this time you're gonna get numbers up to 30 digits long? The task is still the same, but this time you cannot simply solve it with a for loop.\n\n## Additional information\n\n- Your input: a string containing a positive, whole number\n- Your output: a string containing your solution\n- You can expect your input to be a valid, containing only digits (0-9)\n- The maximum input length is 30 digits, and there are 300+ test cases, so brute force solutions will not pass \n\n\n",
