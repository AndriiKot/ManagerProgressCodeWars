    "description": "**Optimize the provided solution to pass this Kata.**\n\nIs well known in Java that `String.format` is a very slow option for message formatting.\n\nYour solution is to create or modify the provided code to create a version that is significantly faster than the provided one as sample code.\n\nNote\n---\n\n* I use 150ms as treshold because even if we generate a median codewars has a time limit and my iterations are limited, so calculated time may vary. If you want to optimize it further try the code in your computer with more iterations than the unit test.",
