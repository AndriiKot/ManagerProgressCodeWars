    "description": "Your task is to implement <b>Counting sort</b> algorithm.\n\nWhat is known about initial array is that all it's members are integers that are greater or equal 0.\n\nMind that it should be faster than O(n*logn) that is provided by Array.prototype.sort.\n\n<h3>Brief description of algorithm:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>determine min and max values</li>\n<li>for each value from min to max count how many times it shows up in array and place corresponding values in another array. for example: <ul>\n<li>array: [3,4,5,4,3,7]</li>\n<li>counted array: [2,2,1,0,1] (corresponds to [3,4,5,6,7])</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>From that you can count displacement of every value by getting number of values that are smaller than current:</li>\n<div id=\"moving_block\">In an example above<br>\nfor '3': (0 numbers are smaller than '3') -> places are 0,1<br>\nfor '4': (places of numbers that are smaller) -> places are 2,3<br>\netc.<br>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n\nAlgorithm itself can be found here<br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort <br>\nor anywhere else on the Internet<br>\n\nP.S. don't try to commit sth like array.sort() - it's of no use.\n",
