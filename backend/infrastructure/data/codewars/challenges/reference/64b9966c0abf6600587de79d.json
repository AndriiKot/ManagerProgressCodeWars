    "description": "You are given an array of length n containing ***positive*** integers. You can perfom an operation on the array in which you can **combine two adjacent elements** of the array by adding them. One operation adds one cost. Your task is to find the minimum number of such operations(possibly zero) required to create a non-decreasing array. \n\nNote: A non-decreasing array arr of length n, is an array such that ```arr[i]<=arr[i+1]``` for all i=0 to i=n-2. For example ```[2, 3, 3, 5]``` is non-decreasing whereas ```[3, 2, 5]``` is not.\n\nIt can be proven that a non decreasing array can always be formed.\n\nYou may modify the input array if you wish to do so.\n\nConstraints:\n~~~if:cpp\n```\nNumber of random tests = 300\n1 <= n <= 100000\n1 <= arr[i] <= 1e9\n```\n~~~\n\n~~~if:python\n```\nNumber of random tests = 200\n1 <= n <= 30000\n1 <= arr[i] <= 1e9\n```\n~~~\n\nExample:\n```\n1) arr = [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\nHere we the only non decreasing array is [3, 2+2+1+1] = [3, 7] meaning 3 operations so return 3.\n\n2) arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nHere the array is already non decreasing so we do not need to do anything and return 0.\n\n3) arr = [3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 1]\nHere the optimal non decreasing array which can be formed is [3, 2+2+1, 1+5, 2+2+1+1] = [3, 5, 6, 6] with a total of 6 operations, hence return 6.\n```",
