    "description": "### Task \nYou are given a sentence containing occurrences of \"Ctrl + C\" and \"Ctrl + V\" keyboard shortcuts. Your goal is to process these shortcuts to generate the final sentence, following specific rules:\n\n- \"Ctrl + C\" will copy all text that precedes it.\n- \"Ctrl + V\" will paste the copied text.\n- A subsequent \"Ctrl + C\" will overwrite the existing copied text.\n\n### Examples\n```\n\"the egg and Ctrl + C Ctrl + V the spoon\" ➞ \"the egg and the egg and the spoon\"\n\n# The input sentence starts with \"the egg and\" which is copied by the first \n\"Ctrl + C,\" and then pasted twice using \"Ctrl + V,\" resulting in \"the egg \nand the egg and\" The last part, \"the spoon,\" remains unchanged.\n\n\"WARNING Ctrl + V Ctrl + C Ctrl + V\" ➞ \"WARNING WARNING\"\n\n\"The Ctrl + C Ctrl + V Town Ctrl + C Ctrl + V\" ➞ \"The The Town The The Town\"\n```\n\n### Output\n\nA string representing the modified sentence after processing the keyboard shortcuts.\n\n### Rules\n\n- Keyboard shortcut commands will appear like normal words in a sentence but should not be copied themselves.\n- Pasting should add a space between words.",
