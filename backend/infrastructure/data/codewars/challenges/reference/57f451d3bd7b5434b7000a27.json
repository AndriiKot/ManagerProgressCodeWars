    "description": "Your goal is to create a data structure that can quickly determine whether nodes are connected.\n\nNodes are represented as positive integers `0-N`.\n\nYou can connect them by saying `connect(a,b)`.\n\nYou should be able to ask if they are connected by saying `isConnected(a,b)`.\n\nConnections are bidirectional, so if `a` is connected to `b`, `b` is also connected to `a`.\n\nThis connection determination is a classic computer science problem, but is also totally deducible from first princicples. You'll get the most learning value out of this if you to try to solve it yourself first before going to look up solutions.\n\nThe API should work like this:\n\n    var nodes = Nodes(6); // size 6\n    nodes.connect(0,1); // node at index 0 is connected with node at index 1\n    nodes.connect(1,2);\n    nodes.isConnected(0,2); // true, since 0 -> 1 -> 2\n    \n",
