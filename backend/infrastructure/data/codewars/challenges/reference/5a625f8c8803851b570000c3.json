    "description": "Adding is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, with the others being subtracting, multiplying and dividing. The sum of two numbers is the total amount of those quantities combined. But everyone knows this. What some people *don't* know is that you can actually add two integers without using the `+` operator.\n\nWrite the function `add(x,y)` which computes sums the integers `x` and `y` without actually using the `+` operator\n",
