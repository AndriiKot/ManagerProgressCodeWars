    "description": "\n<h1> Extremely Important Plotline </h1>\n\nOne day, on your way back home from a long and stressful day of coding at work, you see a long-gone friend of yours.\nLast time you heard from him, taking advice from you, he was **learning to code**, in order to change his career path.\n\n> Long time, no see, mate. How are things going?\n\n> I've been trying this coding thing for a while now but can't seem to grasp it. This prime number challenge is just too much. I try and try, but my tools are simply insufficient for this task.\n\n> Let me take a look at what you've done so far. Wait! **Why aren't you using any keywords**?\n\n> My interpreter doesn't understand those; I think it's because I downloaded a pirated version.\n\n> A **pirated** version of a **free** programming language?\n\nAfter a long conversation which seemed more like an odd excuse to force you into an odd challenge of **solving the problem without keywords**, you decide to attempt to help a friend in need.\n\n<br>\n<h1> Task </h1>\n\nCreate a function ```primes``` that takes an **integer** *(positive, negative or 0)* and returns a list containing all prime numbers smaller or equal to it. The returned list must be sorted.\n\n<br>\n<h1> Restrictions </h1>\n\nYou **must not use any keywords**, except for ```lambda```, as it would be pretty much impossible otherwise.\n\n- ```lambda``` may be used as many times as you wish.\n\n- **operators** may be used freely.\n\n- Imports are disabled, including ```__import__```\n\n- ```eval``` and ```exec``` are disabled.\n\n- Soft keywords such as ```_```, ```match```, ```case``` and ```type``` may be used.\n\n**The checking is done lazily**. That doesn't mean anything fancy about memory saving or something like that, just that the programmer behind this task couldn't be bothered to do some fancy checking, and rather, the code just searches for the **presence of the literal keyword** in the text file.\n\nA small exception has been made for ```in``` and ```is``` in order to avoid flagging 'int' and 'list'. These keywords still **cannot be used conventionally**; however, they may be used as **part of other names**.\n\n<br>\n<h1> Character Limit </h1>\n\nIn order to avoid hard-coding, a character limit has been set at ```2000```.\n\n<br>\n<h1> Random Tests </h1>\n\nThere are ```100``` random tests with the input ranging from ```-100 to 10_000```.\n\n\n<h3> Typing </h3>\n\nThe ```typing``` module has been preloaded for type hinting reasons. No big deal, just a neat thing for typing enthusiasts. ",
