    "description": "The turtle needs to climb to the top of the hill. The distance from the foot of the hill to its top is L. The turtle climbs the hill for N meters per day. At night, she sleeps and slides down M meters. On what day will the turtle climb the hill and stay on it (considering that it will roll down)? You need a function in JS that takes the number of meters a turtle climbs a hill in a day, the number of meters it slides down a hill overnight, and the height of the hill. The function should return the number of the day when the turtle climbed the hill.\n\n`The condition is also true: m < n < l`\n\n`m - The number of meters the turtle slides down at night;`\n\n`n - The number of meters it rises during the day;`\n\n`l - The height of the hill;`\n\n\n`input: calculateTheDay(50, 30, 100)`\n\n`output: 5`",
