    "description": "How many years of your life could you save by working from home?\n\nWrite a function to figure out how many years you could save working from home.  Assume a year has 365 days.  Calculate the result over a time period provided in `[days]`.\n\nCalculate this using the time in hours you'll save `[before]` work - waking up early to prep lunch; as well as `[after]` work - driving home in rush hour. \n\nYour solution should return a string \"Working from home saves `x` years.\" containing the years saved, **rounded to three decimal places.**\n\nExamples:\n\n    before = 1.4, after = 1, days = 100 --> \"Working from home saves 0.027 years.\"\n    before = 1, after = 0.5, days = 1200 --> \"Working from home saves 0.205 years.\"",
