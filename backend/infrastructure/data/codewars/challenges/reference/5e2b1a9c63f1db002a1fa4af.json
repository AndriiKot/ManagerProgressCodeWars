    "description": "This puzzle is based on a somewhat famous riddle and it goes like this:\n\n\nA spy wanted to get into a secret club for some information. But to enter you had to know there’s a secret password.\n\nHe waits outside and spies on two members. When Member 1 knocks on the door, the guard knocks back 6 times and the member replies with 3 knocks and he was let in.\n\nWhen member 2 knocks on the door, the guard knocks 12 times and the member replies with 6 knocks and he was let in.\n\nSo the spy thought he had cracked the logic so he knocked on the door. The guard knocked ten times and the spy replied with 5 knocks but he was not let in.\n\nWhat was the correct secret password?\n\n> Write a function that takes a string argument. eg ``` \"KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK\" ```\n\n> return a string of knocks back. eg ``` \"KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK\" ```\n\nYou can assume that there will always be knocks in the string and that they are never repeated more than 20 times.",
