    "description": "The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption method that was used by Julius Caesar to protect messages to his military. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher\n\n1. Each letter is converted to a number, e.g. `A = 1, B = 2`.\n\n      `APPLE = 1, 13, 13, 9, 5`\n\n2. A 'shift' is then applied to the number. For this example, a shift of `1` is applied to the converted 'APPLE'.\n\n      `2, 14, 14, 10, 6`\n\n3. This set of numbers is then converted back to letters to reveal an encoded message.\n\n      `2, 14, 14, 10, 6 = BQQMF`\n      \n      \nNote: In this Kata, the shift is set to -1 by default.\n\nCreate a function which can be used to decipher a message (such as BQQMF) to reveal the original message (APPLE).",
