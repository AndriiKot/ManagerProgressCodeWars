    "description": "Triangles can be classified by side length: isosceles, equilateral, scalene and by angle: obtuse, acute, right angle.\n\nGiven a piece of graph paper with three dots on it, identify the type of triangle represented by the dots. Each dot will be at the intersection of a vertical and horizontal line.\n\nYour paper is a 2 dimensional array of 0s and the pencil marks are 1s.\n\nYour output must be the first type of triangle you encounter in this order:\n\"equilateral\", \"right angle\", \"isosceles\", \"obtuse\", \"acute\".\n\nIgnore classification \"scalene\" for this exercise as all of the above apart from equilateral can also be scalene.\n\nFun fact: An equilatral triangle cannot be drawn on grid paper where each point is on a grid point. If the grid has regular and finite spacing, at least one vertex cannot be located on a grid point. Of course, if you make the side long enough, you’ll be able to get arbitrarily close, but never quite there.\n\nFor this reason, if all angles of a triangle are within 0.1 degrees tollerance of an equilateral triangle's angles, classify it as equialteral. \n\nIf you to need brush up on your triangles see [this webpage](https://www.cuemath.com/geometry/types-of-triangle/).\n\nHint: Read up on the [Law of Cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines)",
