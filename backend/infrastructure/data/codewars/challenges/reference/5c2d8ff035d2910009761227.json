    "description": "You need to find the Network Address and Broadcast Address of an IPv4 address given in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing).\n\nThe format given is `<IPv4 Address>/<CIDR>`\n\nAn IPv4 address is a set of 4 bytes (octets) separated by periods. Each octet can only be the values `0-255`. Values padded with zeros up to 3 digits are acceptable (e.g `192.168.001.101`)\n\nThe number of `CIDR` is the count of leading `1` bits in the 32-bit subnet mask. As IPv4 addresses are only 32 bits long, values less than `0` or greater than `32` are not permissible.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: `192.168.1.100/24`\n\n_IP Address_: `192.168.1.100` and _Subnet Mask_: 24 bits or `255.255.255.0`\n\nThe subnet mask is a binary bitmask that denotes which bits in the IP address represent the network portion. The remaining bits are the host portion. \n\nThe network address is _all-zeros_ in the host portion of the address.\nThe broadcast address is _all-ones_ in the host portion of the address.\n\n```\n192.168.1.100   11000000 10101000 00000001 01100100\n255.255.255.0   11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000\n               |----------network---------|--host--|\n192.168.1.0     11000000 10101000 00000001 00000000 <- network\n192.168.1.255   11000000 10101000 00000001 11111111 <- broadcast\n```\n\nYour return value should be an array with two elements. The first element is a string containing the network address, and the second element is a string containing the broadcast address. If a bad IP address or CIDR value is given, return `false`.",
