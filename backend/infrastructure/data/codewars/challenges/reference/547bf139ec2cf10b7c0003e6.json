    "description": "A binary search algorithm is a way to look for the index of a certain value in a sorted array.\n\nThe algorithm will progressively cut the original array into smaller and smaller chunks until it finds the desired value. If the desired value is not found, return -1.\n\nLet's take a look at an illustration from Wikipedia:\n\n> The list to be searched: L = 1 3 4 6 8 9 11. The value to be found: X = 4.\n\n> Compare X to 6. X is smaller. Repeat with L = 1 3 4.\n\n> Compare X to 3. X is bigger. Repeat with L = 4.\n\n> Compare X to 4. They are equal. We're done, we found X.\n\n[More information on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)\n\nThis makes it efficient for particularly large arrays because it doesn't have to completely iterate over them, so it will only take logarithmic time.\n\nWrite a function **binSearch** that can perform a binary search on large arrays and not time out. The function will have 2 parameters, which are a **sorted** array and an element to search.\n\n**Note**: indexOf, lastIndexOf, eval, sort and sortedIndex are disabled.",
