    "description": "# RGB Colour changer\nJon has an RGB colour (in hex form), such as `#ABC123`\n\nHe wants a slightly darker version of this colour, e.g. 10% darker.  \nHowever, he cannot simply multiply the hex by 0.9, as it would give the wrong colour (due to the way the RGB hex is structred).\n\nThe RGB hex `#ABC123` is structured in the following way:\n\n`#` is the Hex Identifier  \n`AB` is the amount of Red  \n`C1` is the amount of Green  \n`23` is the amount of Blue\n\n# Your task\nBuild a tool that converts this for Jon. It takes two parameters:\n\n`rgb` is the Hex-String of the RGB colour (may be lowercase or uppercase)\n\n`percent` is the percentage by which to make it darker. Negative percentages should make it lighter.  \nIf this parameter is not supplied, you should default to 10%.\n\n# Important Notes\n-The result must be a lowercase Hex-String  \n-The result must be a valid RGB-Hex, i.e. it must not have values larger than 'FF' or smaller than '00' and be exactly 6 characters long (7 including the #)",
