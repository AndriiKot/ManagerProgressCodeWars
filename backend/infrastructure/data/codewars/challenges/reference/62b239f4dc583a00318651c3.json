    "description": "The local billiard club has ```n``` members.\nDuring a single season, all of its members play each other twice.\nWrite a function ```totalMatches``` that receives the amount of members ```n``` and returns the total amount of matches that have to be played to complete a season.\n\n### Example\nFor three members (let's call them Jim, Jack and John), the schedule could be as follows:\n```\nJim plays Jack\nJim plays John\nJack plays John\nJack plays Jim\nJohn plays Jim\nJohn plays Jack\n```\nThe order and player names are irrelevant, but the total amound of matches for n == 3 equals 6.\n\n\n",
