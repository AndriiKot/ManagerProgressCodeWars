    "description": "Yesterday when you drove on motorway your wheel came off. You barely survived. After that you decided to buy a new wheel and it already had a tire on it. So now you need to check pressure on the tire.\n\nThe optimal pressure is 220; Anything below it or above it is either too low or too high.\n\nThe program should answer either the pressure is \"Too low\", \"Optimal\" or \"Too high\".",
