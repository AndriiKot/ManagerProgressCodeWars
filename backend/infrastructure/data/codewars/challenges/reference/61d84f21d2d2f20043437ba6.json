    "description": "<font size=\"5\"> __What is a hyperrectangle?__ </font><br />\nA hyperrectangle is a generalisation of a rectangle into higher or lower dimensions.\n\n<font size=\"5\"> __Examples of hyperrectangles__ </font><br />\n* A hyperrectangle in 2 dimensions would be a rectangle \n  * its hyperperimeter would be a rectangle's perimeter\n  * its hyperarea would be its area.\n* A hyperrectangle in 3 dimensions would be a cuboid\n  * its hyperperimeter would be its surface area\n  * its hyperarea would be its volume.\n* A hyperectangle in 4 dimensions\n  * its hyperperimeter would be its surface volume\n  * its hyperarea that would be its hypervolume.\n\n<font size=\"5\"> __Your Goal__ </font><br />\nWrite a function that takes in the sides of an n-dimensional hyperrectangle as an array of length n, each item representing a length of the hyperrectangle, and outputs its associated hyperarea and hyperperimeter in a tuple of length 2\n\n<font size=\"5\"> __Technicalities__ </font><br />\n- Assume a point (0-dimensional shape) has a hyperarea of None and a hyperperimeter of None\n- Assume a line (1-dimensional shape) has a hyperarea of its length and a hyperperimeter of None",
