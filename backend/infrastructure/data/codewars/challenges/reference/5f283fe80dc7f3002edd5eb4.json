    "description": "Somehow, a Meme about a yellow Sponge found a reliable Way of expressing Sarcasm without needing special punctuation or explicit declaration.  \nTo use this format, there are but a few rules to follow:\n\n  1. Two consecutive letters, never have the same case (upper- or lowercase)\n  2. A letter consecutive to another letter, is always in the opposite case\n  3. Any Symbol that hasn't a discernible upper- or lowercase representation, is ignored\n\nHere are some quick examples to showcase those rules:\n\n```\ntype Annotations are for Dummies. -> tYpE AnNoTaTiOnS aRe fOr DuMmIeS.\n\nStrict Compare is for Loosers. -> StRiCt CoMpaRe iS fOr LoOsErS.\n\nIf It was h🅰️rd to write, it sh00ld be h4rd tO read! -> If It wAs h🅰️rD tO wRiTe, iT sH00ld bE h4rD tO rEaD!\n```\n\nTyping this way becomes quite bothersome, to help our Users, we will create a new function with this signature:\n\n```typescript\nfunction toSarcastic(input: string) : string;\n```\n\nDuring validation input will always be a non-empty UTF-8 string.",
