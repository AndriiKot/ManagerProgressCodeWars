    "description": "# Preview\nThe new airline Dream Airways is considering to insure their airplanes against potential crashes. There are different insurance contracts available and in order to decide which contract to pick they want to forecast their potential scenarios for the number of incidents.\nThey will provide you with information about their number of flights, the average crash probability and the desired incident forecasts.\n\n# Problem\nYour task is to provide them with the right probability for each potential number of incidents ranging from 0 to a given number of crashes c.\nThose probabilities will depend on the number of total flights Dream Airways will conduct during a year and the average crash probability for Dream Airway's planes.\nYour function should return an array of probabilities for 0 incidents up to c incidents. Each probability should be rounded to 5 decimals.\n\nFor example for 100 flights, a 0.02 crash probability and up to 3 incidents the resulting output should be:\n\n```javascript\n[ 0.13262, 0.27065, 0.27341, 0.18228 ]\n```\n\n## Hint:\nReading about the Binomial Probability Distribution might help to define the probability formula.",
