    "description": "Someone has put a brick (its density is <b>D1</b> kg/m³; height is <b>a</b> m; the brick is a perfect cuboid) into a liquid (of density <b>D2</b> kg/m³), so that the height is perpendicular to the surface of the liquid. The height of its submerged part is <b>h</b> m (<i>0 < h < a</i>). Your task is to estimate if it'll emerge, remain floating at the same position, or sink.\nPlease write a function \n```javascript \nfunction willSink (D1, D2, a, h){...}\n```\nthat will return:\n<ol>\n  <li><code>The brick will emerge by <i>N</i> %</code> (in relation to the starting position; N is calculated and rounded to the nearest integer), or</li>\n  <li><code>The brick will submerge by <i>N</i> %</code> (in relation to the starting position; N is calculated and rounded to the nearest integer), or</li>\n  <li><code>The brick will remain floating at the same position</code>, or</li>\n  <li><code>The brick will sink</code></li>\n</ol>\n\nGood luck!\n\n<h2>Tips</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Due to the Archimedes' principle, a force, which is equal to the weight of liquid dislodged, acts upon a body put into the liquid. When this force is equal to the body's weight, it floats neither emerging nor submerging.</li>\n\n<li>Consider any two values equal while comparing them if they are equal being rounded to the 7th digit.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<i>Contribution would be highly appreciated. English is not my first language, so if you find mistakes, freely correct them.</i>",
