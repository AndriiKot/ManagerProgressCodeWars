    "description": "Return the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be inserted into an vector (first argument) once it has been sorted. The returned value should be a number.\n\nFor example, `getIndexToIns([1,2,3,4], 1.5)` should return 1 because it is greater than `1` (index 0), but less than `2` (index 1).\n\nLikewise, `getIndexToIns([20,3,5], 19)` should return 2 because once the array has been sorted it will look like `[3,5,20]` and `19` is less than `20` (index 2) and greater than `5` (index 1).\n\nRemember to use [Read-Search-Ask](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck/19514) if you get stuck. Write your own code.\n\nhttps://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/where-do-i-belong",
