    "description": "Your task is to calculate the sum of descents for a specific skiier on a set of ski lifts.\n\n## Example\nif a skiier took lift #1 which starts at 100 meters, and lifts them to 1000 meters, they would have an accumulated skiing altitude of 900 meters at the point (1000 - 100). If that same skiier rode down the mountain and took lift #2 which starts at 500 meters and lifts them to 1500 meters, their new accummulated altitude would be 1900 meters ((1000 - 100) + (1500 - 500) = 1900 meters ).\n\n# Data Details\nYou are provided with two values, one a list of skiing lifts by id, and another the list of lifts ridden by a given skiier.\n\nThe `lifts` list is comprised of start and end altitudes in meters, and a lift ID.\nThe `lifts` list will always have one or more lifts.\n\nThe `rides` list is comprised of the lift ids a given skiier used. A skiier may use the same lift multiple times in a row. A skiier may also use each lift only once. Or, a skiier may not use any of the lifts.\n\n## Caveats\nIf a skiier didn't use any of the lifts, then their vertical descent should be `0`.",
