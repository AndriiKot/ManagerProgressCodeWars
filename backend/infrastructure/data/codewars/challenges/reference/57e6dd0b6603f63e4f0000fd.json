    "description": "#Variable Declaration and Assignment\n\n##The Kata\nIn this kata challenge, you will declare a variable with a specific name, and give it a specific assignment. See the comments in the solution area for the details of your challenge.\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\n##Need help getting started? Here's some background!\n\n###What are variables?\nVariables are containers for holding information. You can think of them as envelopes that hold a value until you are ready to use it. Just like the contents of an envelope, the value of a variable can be changed. In JavaScript the variable 'envelope' can only hold one value at a time, so if you change the value, the old value is discarded.\n\n###Declaring a variable\nAn example declaration of a variable named `myVariable`:\n\n```javascript\nvar myVariable;\n```\n\nTo declare _(or define)_ a variable in JavaScript you need to use the KEYWORD `var`. This KEYWORD helps JavaScript understand that you want to make a container to hold a value.\n\nThe `var` KEYWORD is followed by the name of the variable. The name is sometimes called the variable 'identifier'. You can almost name the variable anything you want, but there are some rules:\n\n* Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs _(but not spaces)_\n* Names must begin with a letter\n* Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)\n* Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names\n* Names can not contain a space\n\n###Making an assignment\nAn example assignment of the number 254 to the variable `myVariable`:\n\n```javascript\nmyVariable = 254;\n```\n\nIn JavaScript, the equal sign means assignment. By using the asignment operator (=) you will make the value of whatever is on the right side of the equal sign become the value of whatever is on the left side of the equal sign.\n\n###Also useful: Returning values from a function\nExample code that returns the value of the variable named `myVariable`:\n\n```javascript\nreturn myVariable;\n```\n\n##See Also\n\n* [W3Schools JavaScript Variables](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp)\n",
