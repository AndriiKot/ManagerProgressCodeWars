    "description": "I believe everyone who once lived in building with elevator had this dilema.\nThe classic I am late for (Work, School, Bus etc.) should i take the stairs to be faster.\n\nYou will be put into the situation of John he oversleeeps everytime and he always has to hurry for bus.\n\nYour Task:\nYou will be given floor John lives on and Floor on which the elevator is.\nYou will be how many seconds he has until the bus leaves\nStation is right out of the door so we will not count any exces time.\nElevator is quite a fast one and can clear 1 floor in 5 seconds but it takes him both 6 seconds to close and 6 seconds to open the doors.\nElevator always starts with open doors\n\nJohn is also quite a fast one too as he can clear 1 floor in 10 seconds (down but also up) and as he was an athlete he doesnt get tired\n\nReturn True or False if John can make it to the bus",
