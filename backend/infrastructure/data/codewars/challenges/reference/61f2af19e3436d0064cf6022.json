    "description": "# Problem\n\nYou team is holding a meeting at work for everyone in your large company.\n\nYour boss asks you to get a list of all the guest's emails from the Google Calendar event. Google Calendar gives you the option to \"Copy guest emails\" from the event, however it comes in this format: \n\n```\nJoe Bloggs <joe.bloggs@gmail.com>, Jane Doe <jane.doe@gmail.com>, ...etc.\n```\n\nYour boss specifically asked for a list of _just_ the guest's emails. Surely you can't spend time typing them out one by one - that would take forever!\n\nLuckily you can code! Please complete the function to return a list of all the guest's emails\n\n## Input\n\nThe input will always be a string with the format `first_name last_name <email_address>` separated by commas when there is more than one guest.\n\n## Output\n\nThe output must be an array of strings containing the emails of every guest.\n\n",
