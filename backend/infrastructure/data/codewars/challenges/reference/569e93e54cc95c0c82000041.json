    "description": "The `publish-subscribe` pattern is one that allows communication between two or more things (modules, functions, etc.) without having them be tightly coupled.  In this pattern, the communication happens through a `hub` over channels (`topics`), which are generally identified by a string.  When a user wants to `subscribe` to a topic, they will provide a function (`handler`) that will be executed when the topic is published.  When a user wants to `publish` a topic, they will need only call the hub's `publish` method, indicating the topic identifier, and passing in any other relevant information as additional arguments.\n\nCreate a pub/sub system that allows a user to:\n\n* Subscribe to a topic\n* Publish to a topic\n\nWhen a user publishes to a topic, any arguments provided to the `publish` method, not including the `topic`, should be passed to the handler(s).\n\n```javascript\nvar handle = hub.subscribe(\"user/added\", function (user) {\n  console.log(\"A user named \" + user.name + \" was added!\");\n});\n\nvar user = {\n  name: \"Matt\"\n};\n\nusers.add(user);\n\nhub.publish(\"user/added\", user); // logs \"A user named Matt was added!\"\n```\n\n\nWhen a user subscribes to a topic, the subscription method should return an object (`handle`) that has a `remove` method on it.  That method should remove that subscription.  If there are multiple handles subscribed to a topic and a handle's `remove` method is called, only that handle's subscription should be removed.  All other handles should operate as normal.\n\n```javascript\nvar handle = hub.subscribe(\"test/remove\", function () {\n  console.log(\"Testing handle\");\n});\n\nhub.publish(\"test/remove\"); // Testing handle\n\nhandle.remove();\n\nhub.publish(\"test/remove\"); // Nothing is logged\n```",
