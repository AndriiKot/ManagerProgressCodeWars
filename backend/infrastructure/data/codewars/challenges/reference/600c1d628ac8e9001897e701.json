    "description": "You got involved in an incredible story!\nThe MI5 forced in the lair of an extreme right activist group and they found a bunch of cuneiform tablets.\n\nAt first, they thought they were stolen artefacts the group was using to resell to finance their activities; the agents went to the British Museum to identify the owners and met with Irving Finkel, the curator in charge of assyriology. To the surprise of all, he certified that the tablets were not old and not even written in Sumerian or Akkadian. He suspected that they are written... in English.\n\n“It looks pretty funny;most of the tablets seems to be an Oliver Twist transcription in cuneiform characters. Now, I cannot be totally sure. Let me give you a student to check them all...”\n\nTo continue the investigation, he gave the agents a couple of materials and... yourself! Will you be able to help the MI5 to decode the tablets?\n\nSome of your notes:\n+ https://blog.britishmuseum.org/how-to-write-cuneiform/?fbclid=IwAR2PVWiEjsgAyTyn1kN8_oNRZ5hTmOfO9sc1UcR0Yjglge7S6W96m2gDSBU\n+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cuneiform_signs\n\nExtra information:\n+ The variable CUNEIFORM contains a dictionary of all the cuneiform signs that have been identified on all the given tablets. The key is based on the unicode long name (Half of them are confusing and misleading according to specialists !)\n+ The test cases are sorted by order of complexity.\n\n\n\n\n",
