    "description": "Create a simple algorithm to find the [Greatest Comon Factor (GCF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) between two number. Your function should accept two integers and should return an integer as GCF between inputs.\n\nFor example:\n\n    largest_factor(50,25)\n    should return 25\n\nThis was because 50 and 25 are both divisible by 25 which is the possible largest factor between the two.\n\n    largest_factor(81,63)\n    should return 9\n    \n    largest_factor(24,54)\n    should return 6\n\n    largest_factor(67,19)\n    should return 1\n\nAcceptable return value is greater or equal to 1, also, `num1` and `num2` should be an integer greater than 0.",
