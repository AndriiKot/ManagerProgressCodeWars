    "description": "You will be given an integer number n that represents the length of the sides of a square. Inside this square there are some smaller squares. The number of the smaller squares is n*n.\n\nFor example, if you were given a value of 8 for n, you would get a square like a chess board (one big 8x8 square with 64 smaller squares inside).\n\nYour job is to create a function rectangle_number that takes n as an argument and returns the maximum number of different RECTANGLES that could be formed inside the bigger square.\n\n\n\nExamples:\n - for n = 1 -> there could be 1 rectangle.\n \n - for n = 2 -> there could be 9 rectangles:\n     \n     4 squares 1x1;    ||   2 rectangles 1x2 ||\n     2 rectangles 2x1; ||   1 square 2x2;\n     \n     total: 4+2+2+1 = 9\n     \n - for n = 3 -> there could be 36 rectangles:\n \n     9 squares 1x1;     ||  6 rectangles 1x2 ||  6 rectangles 2x1 ||\n     3 rectangles 3x1;  ||  3 rectangles 1x3 ||  4 squares 2x2 ||\n     2 rectangles 2x3;  ||  2 rectangles 3x2 ||  1 square 3x3;\n     \n     total: 9+6+6+3+3+4+2+2+1 = 36\n     \n You get the idea. Good luck!\n \n     \n",
