    "description": "Challenge: Roman Numeral to Decimal Converter\n\nDuring your research for a history class, you stumbled upon some documents written in the Roman numeral system. To expedite your work, you need to develop an algorithm that converts these numbers to the decimal base.\n\nFor this kata, we will focus on numbers ranging from 1 to 3999 and utilize only the standard Roman characters and rules.\n\nWe have provided 12 fixed tests and 50 random tests to validate your solution ;)\n\n## How Roman Numerals Work\n\nRoman numerals are a numbering system used in the ancient Roman Empire and in other cultures influenced by it. Unlike the decimal system we use today, Roman numerals are represented by a limited set of letters from the Roman alphabet.\n\nHere are the main symbols used in Roman numerals and their corresponding values:\n\n- I: 1\n- V: 5\n- X: 10\n- L: 50\n- C: 100\n- D: 500\n- M: 1000\n\nRoman numbers are formed by combining these symbols, following specific rules:\n\n1. Addition: Symbols are simply added together to form a larger number. For example, II represents 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n2. Subtraction: When a smaller value appears to the left of a larger value, the smaller value is subtracted from the larger value. For example, IV represents 5 - 1 = 4.\n\n3. Repetition: A symbol can be repeated up to three times consecutively to represent the sum of that repeated symbol. For example, XXX represents 10 + 10 + 10 = 30.\n\n4. Composition: Multiple symbols are combined to form larger numbers. The order of the symbols is important, and the total value is calculated by adding or subtracting the values of the symbols in the correct order. For example, LX represents 50 + 10 = 60.\n\nTo ensure simplicity and clarity, additional rules apply to Roman numerals:\n\n- It is not allowed to use more than three consecutive symbols of the same type. Instead, the symbol of smaller value is placed to the left of the symbol of larger value to represent subtraction.\n\n- Traditional Roman numerals do not use symbols with values larger than 1,000. To represent larger numbers, a horizontal line is placed above one or more symbols to multiply their value by 1,000. However, this special notation will not be used in this kata.\n\nThese are the basic principles of Roman numerals. Although this system is not widely used in modern mathematics, it is still observed in various applications such as chapter numbers, page numbers, historical monument dates, and in aesthetic or ceremonial contexts.\n\nGood luck with the kata!",
