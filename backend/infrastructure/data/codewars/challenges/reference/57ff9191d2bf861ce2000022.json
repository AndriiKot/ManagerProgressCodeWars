    "description": "I was born on October 13, 1978, a Friday the 13th.  I've always celebrated a little more when my birthday falls on a Friday (I even tend to celebrate Friday the 13ths that aren't my birthday).  Due to leap year, there's occasionally a long gap between years where my birthday falls on a Friday.\n\nThis lead me to developing this kata which is a decent way to familiarize yourself with your language's date functions.\n\nWrite a function `birthday_calc` which takes a birthday (`{1978, 10, 13}`) and a day of the week (`:friday`) and returns a tuple of the number of times the birthday has fallen on the day of the week and then next year it falls on that day.\n\nMake sure the function raises an error on invalid date or day inputs.\n\n#Examples\n*Note:* examples assume a current date of `{2016, 10, 13}`, tests use the current date from `:calendar.universal_time`.\n\n`birthday_calc({1978, 10, 13}, :friday)` should return `{5, 2017}`\n\n`birthday_calc({1976, 11, 22}, :sunday)` should return `{6, 2020}`\n\n",
