    "description": "Given four point (A,B,C,D), please calculate intersection point of segments, which they are representing. Intersection point is in another words, a point which belongs to both segments. \n\n* all points can be numbers of any size, both positive and negative.\n* you will be given only valid Numbers as points coordinates, so there is no need to validate them\n* intersection point coordinates doesn't have to be Integer, can be Float.\n* (line) segment #1: starts in point A and ends in point B.\n* (line) segment #2: starts in point C and ends in point D.\n* also, and **this is important**: if any of lines should be vertical -> return false\n\nFor example, given points:\n\n    [1,1],[3,1],[0,2],[3,0] // A, B, C, D\n    \nIntersection point should be in:\n\n    [1.5,1]",
