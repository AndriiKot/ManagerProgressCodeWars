    "description": "## Function Description\n\nThe function, named `findProductById`, is designed to retrieve a specific product object from an array of product objects based on a given product ID. It takes two parameters:\n\n1. **products**: An array of product objects. Each product object is expected to at least contain an `id` property.\n2. **id**: A string representing the unique identifier for the product to be found.\n\n### Function Operations\n\n- Validates the types of the input parameters.\n  - Checks if `products` is an array and `id` is a string.\n  - Throws a TypeError if these conditions are not met.\n- Searches through the `products` array for an object with an `id` that matches the given `id` parameter.\n- Returns the product object if a matching product is found.\n- Returns `null` if no matching product is found, indicating that the product ID does not exist in the array.\n",
