    "description": "There's a bus route between Rome and Madrid.<br> \nIt goes through 7 cities and in each city (except for Rome and Madrid) the bus stops for one hour.<br> \nIncluding the 5 stops, it takes 25 hours overall to complete.<br>\nThe drive time (in hours) between cities is inside `data` in the starter code.<br>\n\nGiven two buses that leave at different times in opposite directions, write a function that returns where they'll meet.<br>\n\nIf they meet in a city return the city's name.<br> \nIf they meet between 2 cities return \"between [cityXFromMadrid] and [cityYFromMadrid].<br>\nIf they don't meet return \"No meeting point\".\n\nInputs are stringed dates that represent the departure time of each bus.<br>\nBus 1 always starts at Madrid and bus 2 always starts at Rome.<br> \nYour function should consider months, days, hours and minutes in both inputs.\n\n**Examples:**<br>\n`meet('Thu Jan 31 2019 12:00:00', 'Thu Feb 01 2019 13:00:00')`<br>\n`//outputs \"Rome\"`<br>\n\n`meet('Thu Feb 07 2019 12:00:00', 'Thu Feb 08 2019 13:01:00')`<br>\n`//outputs \"No meeting point\"`<br>\n\n`meet('Thu Feb 07 2019 00:00:00', 'Thu Feb 07 2019 18:00:00')`<br> \n`// outputs \"Florence\"`<br>\n\n`meet('Thu Feb 07 2019 12:00:00', 'Thu Feb 07 2019 13:00:00')`<br>\n`// outputs \"between Montpellier and Nice\"`<br>\n\nFurther, quite descriptive, test cases can be found in the example tests.\n\n",
