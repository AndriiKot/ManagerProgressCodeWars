    "description": "While exploring the jungle, you have found an ancient broken robot, called Addornot. Addornot can only communicate in multidimensional string arrays (`String[][]`). However, due to age, his messages get corrupted with extra Strings. But Addornot is able to flag which strings are part of his message and should be read, and which are not and should be ignored.\n\nInner arrays will contain two strings. First string will be the string that is/isn't part of Addornot's message. The second one will be either `\"1\"` or `\"0\"`. 1 meaning the first String is part of the message, 0 - meaning string should be ignored.\n\n\nIt is your task to write a function that receives `String[][]` and figures out which strings should be added to form a message and return a String - Addornot's message.\n\n`{{\"h\", \"1\"}, {\"a\", \"0\"}, {\"i\", \"1\"}}` should return `\"hi\"`.
