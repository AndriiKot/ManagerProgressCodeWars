    "description": "In this simplified version of the game Nim, there are 12 coins. Each player can either remove 1 or 2 or 3 coins. Whoever picks up the last coin wins the game.\n\nYour task is to write an AI that always wins (the player will always go first).\n\nWrite a class ``Game`` that contains the function ``turn`` :\n\n``turn`` takes the player's (in this case the tests) move as input (has to be between 1 - 3) and returns the AI's (your program) move (if the player won, the AI returns 0)\n\n``Exceptions``:\nturn needs to throw an Exception when \n- the player input is below 1 \n- the player input is above 3 \n- the player inputs even tho the game is over\n\n\nAny feedback is very appreciated\n",
