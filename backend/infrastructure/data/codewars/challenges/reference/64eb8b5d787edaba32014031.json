    "description": "John likes to read a lot, he has a peculiar way of doing this, he starts with a random number of pages in first day, and after each passing day he decreases the daily amount by 1, whenever the daily amount reaches 1 it goes back to up until reaching the initial amount again, he repeats the process until he finishes reading the book.\n\n\nExample: (initial random value = 5)\n```\nDay      -  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10 ...\nQuantity -  5   4   3   2   1   2   3   4   5   4  ...\n```\n\nJohn has a superstition, after finishing a daily reading, if the last page read that day is odd, he reads one more page. This does not interfere with the daily reading pattern.\n\nTask:\nWrite a function that receives the total number of pages in the book that John will read and the number of pages in first day. Return the number of days it will take John to finish this book.\n\nRandom tests:\n\n -Book size: 10-450\n\n -Initial number of pages: 2-8\n \nEnjoy and good luck!",
