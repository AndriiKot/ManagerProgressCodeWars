    "description": "We've found some old papers belonging to the late mathematician Dr Baseless\n\nDr Baseless was known to work with number systems of different bases, and therefore the team are having some difficulty understanding his work.\n\nYou've been given a set of equations, and we need to find out what base each equation is written in.\n\nLuckily, we know that Dr Baseless's arithmetic was flawless, so each equation is known to be correct\nAdditionally, we know that Dr Baseless never used a base greater than 20\n\nEach equation is given in a string in the form of either:\n```\nx+y=z\nx/y=z\nx-y=z\nx*y=z\n```\nAll of the numbers will be integers, and all divisions will divide exactly\n\nThe characters used to represent digits will be the numbers 0-9 and the letters A-J\n\nFor each equation, you must find out in what base the equation holds true\n\n__Example__\n\nThe string '11-2=2' is in base 3 because this equation is the base 3 form of 4-2=2, so your program should return 3\n\n",
