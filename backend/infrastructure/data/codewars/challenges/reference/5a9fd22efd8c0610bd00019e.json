    "description": "*The king announced that his daughter was captured by an evil dragon. You being a brave knight could not leave this alone, and decided to go on an adventure to free the princess. But, as soon as you reached its lair, you found... an old computer which unlocks the entrance into the cave if you manage to sort a **large** chunk of data. Every second is important, and so you must solve the riddle as fast as possible.*  \n\n___\n\nYour mission is to beat the limitations of this old computer and implement a sorting algorithm quick enough to sort and `return` an array of `N` elements, where `9 * 10^n <= N <= 11 * 10^n` and `0 <= n <= 5` before the time runs out (*and dragon eats the princess*).\n\n___\n\nNOTE 1: you are not allowed to `import` anything.  \nNOTE 2: `eval` and `exec` are not available for use.  \nNOTE 3: *The letter* `s` *on the keyboard is missing...*",
