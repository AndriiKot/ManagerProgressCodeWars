(of my room)\n\nThe  last  thing I remember is this Kata. The  author  promised\nme that it is  easy, but  I  failed  as  there  were  no  clear\ninstructions.   There   was   nothing:  no  function   and   no\ntests.  The  only  tip  he  gave  me  was  to   \"look\"   around.\n\nI  only  found  a  class called  \"Secret\"  but  it doesn't seem\nto do anything. I   found   it   in   the   preloaded  section!\n\nAfter  an  hour  or so I gave up and decided that I have better \nthings to do.\n\nYou  are  my  last  hope!  Maybe  you  can  solve this  riddle!\n\n\nSincerely,\nzer0_b1t\n```",
