    "description": "# Task\n\nYou are working on a assembly line with very strict rules. Breaks are only allowed if you have nothing to do for a given time (idle timeout). Every break increases this time.\n\nImplement a function `startWorking` with two arguments. The first argument is the `doBreak` function, which is called whenever you want to do a break. The second argument is the idle timeout before you are allowed to call `doBreak`.  \nReturn a new function which is called everytime you have to work. If this function is not called during the idle timeout, call another function `doBreak`.  \nEvery break increases the idle timeout for your next break by 100 miliseconds.  \nYour break is over when the next work is requested.  \nYou always end with a break.  \nIt's not allowed to do a break before the returned function is called.\n\n## Example\n\n```\nInitial idle timeout: 100ms\n\nFirst call at 0ms\nSecond call at 80ms\nFirst break at 180ms; Timeout changed to 200ms\nThird call at 200ms\nFourth call at 350ms\nSecond break at 550ms; Timeout changed to 300ms\nFifth call at 600ms\nThird break at 900ms\n```\n\n## Tests\n\nRunning tests require 6-10 seconds to complete, depending on the timeouts of the random tests.\n\n## Resources\n\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout\n- https://redd.one/blog/debounce-vs-throttle",
