    "description": "## Background\n\nPerl6 ( Raku ) introduces a very amazing grammar suger named whatever expression, like this:\n```perl\nmy @fib = 1, 1, * + * ... *;\nsay @fib[0..10];\n$> (1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89)\n```\nIt's self-evident that the above code can generate an infinite lazy Fibonacci sequence, which really is cool! You can try it in [https://glot.io/new/raku](https://glot.io/new/raku).\n However it's unfortunate that such an amazing syntax is not supported in Ruby. Can we try to implement it in ruby? That's the challenge!\n\nImplement a function which supports the calculation of such expressions.\n\n## Illustration\n1. There's no need to handle error cases, as all inputs are guaranteed to be valid & well formatted.\n2. The whatever expression can be arbitrary and complicated.\n3. Your implementation must be lazy, just like Perl6 does. It should generate a lazy and infinite sequence.\n\n## Definition\n`$x[0], \\quad x[1], \\quad .. \\quad x[n], \\quad \\sum_{i=m}^{n} x_i \\quad ... \\quad *$`\n\n1. `$0 \\leq m \\leq n$`\n2. `$x[i]$` can be an arbitrary valid Ruby object\n3. `$\\sum{}$` can be any valid polynomial calculation expr, and there is no extra commas( , ) for the simplication of the parsing, eg: `[1, 2], [3, 4], * + [5, 6] ... *` wouldn't to be tested so that there is no any need to implement a complete & complicated parser, that's too trivial & boring ... anyway in the left side of the last comma, that's initial items.\n\n## Happy coding!\n![](https://glot.io/static/img/perl6.svg?etag=jyDmhz1R)",
