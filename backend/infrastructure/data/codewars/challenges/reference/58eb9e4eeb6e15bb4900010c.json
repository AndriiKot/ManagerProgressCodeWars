    "description": "As input you get a String, which is a sequence of digits (always valid, you don't have to check for letters/whitespaces etc.)\n\nYour task is to count all the distinct primes that appear in the input String. For example:\n\ninput: \"22173\"\noutput: 6, because primes are: 2, 3, 7, 17, 73, 173. Notice that '2' appears two times in a String, but it's counted only once. 13 is not counted, because '1' and '3' are separated by '7'.\n\nInput will always contain minimum 1 digit and will always be valid.\n\nNumber can be really long, so it may not be as easy as you think.\n",
