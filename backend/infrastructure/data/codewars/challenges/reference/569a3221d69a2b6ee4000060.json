    "description": "In investing, one way of determining where a stock is a worthwhile buy is by comparing a stock's current price to a stock's price at its all time high. \n\nIf a stock's current price is less than or equal to 80% of its all time high, then it's a \"buy\". \n\nBuild a buy calculator takes the current price of a stock, and the stock's all time high, and returns \"Buy\" if the stock is a buy, or \"Pass\" if it's not worthwhile. \n",
