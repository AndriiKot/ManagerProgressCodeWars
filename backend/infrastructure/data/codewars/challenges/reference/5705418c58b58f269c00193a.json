    "description": "A company asks its employees to update their personal information once a year. They do this by submitting a log containing any changes to their personal information since the previous year. Logs are made in the following format:\n```javascript\n//first log\n{ name : 'Joe Bloggs',\naddress : '123 Fake Street',\nyear : 2007 }\n\n//second log\n{ name : 'Joe Doe',\nmarried : true,\nyear : 2008 }\n```\nThere is no limit on the amount of fields a log can have, nor the field names or values. The only field which is guaranteed to be in each log is the year the log was made, ```year```. If no information changes, a log does not have to be submitted for that year.\n\nWrite a function which takes a collection of logs (indeterminate in size, not necessarily in chronological order) and returns a log with the most up to date information for each field. The fields should be in order of their first chronological appearance in a log.\n\nFor the example logs above, the expected result would be the following object:\n```javascript\n{ name: 'Joe Doe',\naddress: '123 Fake Street',\nyear: 2008,\nmarried: true }\n```",
