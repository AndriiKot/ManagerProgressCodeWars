    "description": "## Background \nThanos, the Mad Titan, having rid the universe of half of its population, has turned his attention to the computerized world. He now wants to rid all Lists of half of their elements at random in order to create balance. He needs a loyal servant to augment his Infinity Gauntlet. That's you!\n****************************************************************************\n\n## Your Task:\nGiven a List of even size as a parameter, your goal is to remove half of the elements in the given List using the Random class object given. The InfinityGauntlet class constructor will take in a seed for a Random class object. You need to use this random class object to remove half of the elements. \n\n## Specific Directions:\n```You should generate a random integer between 0 and the size of the list, and remove it from your list until your list is half the size of the original list.```\n\n## Attention:\nWarriors please do not mutate your original input\n****************************************************************************\n\n## Examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n\n  RandomSeed = 12\n\n  Input: ``` List = {0 , 1 , 2 , 3}. ``` should return\n  \n  ```List = {1 , 3}.```\n  \n### Example 2:\n  \n  RandomSeed = 22\n\n  Input: ``` List = {0 , 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14}. ``` should return \n  \n  ```List = {0, 2, 4, 8}.```\n  \n\n******************************************************************************\nThis Kata is still in Beta: I want to make this a working an fun kata, so if you have any advice please let me know in the discourse! I am a novice programmer and any and all advice helps! ",
