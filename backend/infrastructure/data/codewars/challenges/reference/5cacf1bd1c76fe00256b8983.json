    "description": "## Task\nGiven a list of points, return a string representing the smallest-degree polynomial that passes through these points.\n\n## String Format\n* Polynomials should be written in standard form: `ax^n+bx^(n-1)+...`, no factoring\n* `x` is the variable, there is no `y=` or `=y`\n* Terms should appear in order from largest power to smallest, and must be separated by `+` or `-`\n* For powers greater than 1, use `^`\n* Terms with a coefficient of `0` should not be included, except in the event of a 0 polynomial, in which case return `'0'`\n* Non-constant terms with a coefficient of `1` or `-1` shouldn't display the `1`\n\n## Examples\n`poly_from_points([(-1, 2), (0, 4), (1, 10), (2, 26)])` returns `'x^3+2x^2+3x+4'`.\n\n`poly_from_points([(-2, 19), (-1, 3), (3, 79), (2, 15), (1, 1)])` returns `'x^4-x+1'`. The `x^2` and `x^3` terms have coefficients of `0`, so they are not included.\n\n\n## Notes\n* There will always be at least 1 point given\n* No point will appear twice in a list\n* All points will have integer coordinates\n* The correct answer will always have integer coefficients\n* Libraries like numpy, scipy and sklearn are forbidden. If you want a use a reasonable module but are prevented from doing so, please notify me with a suggestion.\n\n## Test cases\n* 5 sample tests\n* 100 random small tests (number of points between 1 and 4, coefficients and x-values between -5 and 5)\n* 100 random big tests (number of points between 11 and 14, coefficients and x-values between -100 and 100)\n",
