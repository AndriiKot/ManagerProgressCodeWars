    "description": "## Objective\n\nPart 1\n\nThe Counter component keeps track of a count value in state. There are two buttons which call methods `increment()` and `decrement()`. Write these methods so the counter value is incremented or decremented by 1 when the appropriate button is clicked. Also, create a `reset()` method so when the reset button is clicked, the count is set to `0`. The default value for counter should be set as `0`.\n\nPart 2\n\nEach time the counter changes, the color of the top of the border should be changed as well. Please, use `getRandomColor` function for choosing the color. The default value for color should be set as `null`.\n\nNote: Make sure you don’t modify the classNames of the buttons.",
