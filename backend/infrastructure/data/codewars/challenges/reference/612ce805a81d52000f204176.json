    "description": "Write a function that takes in a string and for each character, returns the distance to the nearest vowel in the string. If the character is a vowel itself, return 0.\n\nVowels are : aeiou AEIOU \n\nFor our case `y` is not a vowel \n\n**NOTE : Some tests are 1500letter long.**\n\nEdge cases :\n\n- You will be tested for empty string so : `''` is a valid test the answer is `[]` \n- You will slso be tested for strings with no vowels in which case you simply give length of string since that's the potential distance (you never know if another letter was added it could be vowel) (for each letter)\n- Obviously in case someone missed uppercase and lowercase both exist\n- so will !@#$%^&*() or 12345678890 as well \n\n- for those of you who find it easy/moderately hard i will see about making a code golf one. \n- It is also possible you end up getting nothing but vowels in a string, the answer in that case obviously would be 0 across the board \n\nExamples : \n\n---\n```\nsolution(\"aaaaa\") ➞ [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nsolution(\"bbb\") ➞ [3, 3, 3]\n\nsolution(\"abcdabcd\") ➞ [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3]\n\nsolution(\"shopper\") ➞ [2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n```\n\nPublished : 4:50 8/30/2021\n\nFirst clear : 6:13 same day\n\n(Thanks to B1ts for pointing out error)\n",
