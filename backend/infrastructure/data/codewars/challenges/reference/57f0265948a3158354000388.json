    "description": "<h3>Description</h3>\nIn cryptography, a Caesar's cipher, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. <b>For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.</b> The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.\nThe transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher alphabet is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23 (the shift parameter is used as the key):\n\nPlain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ <br/>\nCipher:   XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW\n\n\n<h3>Your Task</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n  \tCreate a class called <i>CaesarCipher</i> with two methods: <i>encrypt</i> and <i>decrypt</i>, which one of those two methods should receive three arguments: a text to be decrypted/encrypted, a way of shift (right/left) and a number of shifts.\n  </li>\n  \n  <li>\n  \tYou should ignore punctuactions and other chars (just for simplicity), but don't forget to give back white spaces.\n  </li>\n   \n</ul>\n\n<h3>Examples:</h3>\n<p>\nencrypt(\"computer\", \"left\", 7) #vhfinmxk <br>\ndecrypt(\"vhfinmxk\", \"left\", 7) #computer\n</p>\n\n<p>\nencrypt(\"i am from brazil\", \"left\", 10) #b tf ykhf uktsbe <br> \ndecrypt(\"b tf ykhf uktsbe\", \"left\", 10) #i am from brazil\n</p>\n\n",
