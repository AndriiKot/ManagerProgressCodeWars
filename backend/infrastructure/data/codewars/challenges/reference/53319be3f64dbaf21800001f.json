    "description": "# Point in a Polygon\nGiven a 2d polygon description and a point coordinate, determine whether the point exists inside or outside the polygon.\n\nThe polygon may be simple or complex, and can include curves. The polygon description must be for a closed polygon, in which the first and last point\ndescribed are the same.\n\nThe polygon description will use two operators: moveto and lineto, similar to a subset of Postscript path operators.\n\n'moveto' sets the current x y point\n\n'lineto' draws a boundary to the next x y point, which becomes the new current x y point\n\nA typical polygon descriptor\n```javascript\n  var thisPolygon = {'polygon' : [\n\t\t{'moveto' : {'x' : 10, 'y' : 10}},\n\t\t{'lineto' : {'x' : 20, 'y' : 10}},\n\t\t{'lineto' : {'x' : 20, 'y' : 20}},\n\t\t{'lineto' : {'x' : 10, 'y' : 20}},\n\t\t{'lineto' : {'x' : 10, 'y' : 10}}\n\t]}; ```\n\nA typical point descriptor\n```javascript\n\tvar thisPoint = {'x' : 12, 'y' : 18}; ```\n\nA good starting point for the point in polygon algorithm test can be found here: http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/wrf/Research/Short_Notes/pnpoly.html\nThere are other examples as well. It will require that any curves be rendered into straight-line segments.\n\nGiven a polygon and a point, the pointInPoly function will return true if the point is in side the polygon, false if it is outside, or a string: 'Error!'\nif the polygon is not closed properly. (This last because the Test.expectError() call does not seem to handle errors as stated.)\n\n",
