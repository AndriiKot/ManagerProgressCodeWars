    "description": "You have just been hired as a developer for CodeWars Airline - congratulations!\n\nThe airline's maiden voyage, CWA001, has attracted a fair amount of enthusiasm, and a few people have even pre-booked their tickets. Unfortunately, the previous developer was a bit lazy, and kept track of the seat bookings by storing them in a string of booked seats in the following format:\n\n\"1A 3B 5D 11J 3D\" etc.\n\nManagement would like you to write a program that lets them know how many seats are still available. They gave you the following information:\n\n- the plane has \"n\" rows, all in the same configuration\n- each row has 10 seats, labeled \"A\" through \"J\"\n\nAn intern has checked the existing string \"s\" to make sure that no seats have been double booked, so you don't have to worry about that.\n\nGood luck!",
