    "description": "The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a right shift of 5, G would become L, and H would become M. Shifts \"wrap\" around the alphabet, so Z with a right shift of 1 would become A.\n\nDon't forget, uppercase letters stay uppercase and lowercase letters stay lowercase. Any spaces or punctuation marks stay the same.\n\nYour task is, given a plaintext and a shift, encrypt the plaintext with the specified shift (to the right) using the Caesar Cipher. So, if the initial plaintext was \"Math is awesome\", and the shift was 2, your function should return \"Ocvj ku cyguqog!\" Note: The plaintext will always be a string with length 1 or greater.",
