    "description": "No, we're not talking about curry - the food! In fact, we can cook a new topic that involves functions in programming called currying. It's spicy, hot, and delicious when used properly.\n\nHere's an example of currying in action:\n\n```javascript\n\nvar initial = add(5) //The value of initial is a function\nvar result = initial(3) //The value is 8\nvar result2 = initial(7) //The value is 12\n```\n\nThe cool thing about currying is that it allows you to return a function with given arguments and use it throughout your code. We're simply reducing the amount of arguments needed for an event/action!\n\nLet's use this concept of \"currying\" with simple addition. Let's say I have a function to add numbers but I also want that function to be able to add a constant numeric value to other integers passed into it.\n\nThus, if I stated:\n\n```javascript\n\nvar addSeven = add(7) //Sets up a variable with a function that adds seven to all future passed arguments\nvar output1 = addSeven(5) //Gives us 12!\n\nvar sum = add(7)(5) // Also gives us 12!\n```\n\nI'll give you some code to start with! Have fun!\n\nHere are some hints also given in the code above:\n\n- The initial/high-order function should return a function\n- The returned function should be able to add the passed integer from the high-order function with the argument passed to itself\n- This requires knowledge of scope in programming and function calling\n- I recommend making a Control Flow chart to sketch the function's interactions!\n\nHope this helps!",
