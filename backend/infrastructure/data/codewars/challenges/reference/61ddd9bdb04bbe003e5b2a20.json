    "description": "The glad number of N is the difference between the number of divisors of N-1 and N, but if this difference is 0 or less than 0 it is 0.\nWhen the difference is greater than 0: \nIf it is greater than all the glad numbers or equal ,then the glad number is the difference, but if not, it is the greatest.\n\n```javascript\nnumber = 1  d = 1 glad_number = 0\nnumber = 2  d = 2 glad_number = 0\nnumber = 3  d = 2 glad_number = 0\nnumber = 4  d = 3 glad_number = 0\nnumber = 5  d = 2 glad_number = 1\nnumber = 6  d = 4 glad_number = 0\nnumber = 7  d = 2 glad_number = 2\nnumber = 8  d = 4 glad_number = 0\nnumber = 9  d = 3 glad_number = 2\nnumber = 10 d = 4 glad_number = 0\nnumber = 11 d = 2 glad_number = 2\nnumber = 12 d = 6 glad_number = 0\nnumber = 13 d = 2 glad_number = 4\n```\n\nYou have to show:\n\nwhat is the glad number of N and how many times is it repeated?\n\nFor Example\n```javascript\nglad_numbers(9) = [2,2]\nglad_numbers(13) = [4,1]\n```",
