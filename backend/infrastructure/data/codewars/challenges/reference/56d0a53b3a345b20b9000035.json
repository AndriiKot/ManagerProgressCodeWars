    "description": "You're working for a big airline company. You task is to build a new feature for their in-flight entertainment system. Given a list of movies and the flight's duration, find two different movies with a total runtime equal to the flight's.\nThe movies are given as a list of integers, each integer representing the movie's length in minutes. Assume the users will watch exactly two movies. Optimize for runtime over memory.\nFor example, given a flight of 273 minutes and the following list of movie lengths:\n  [134, 92, 118, 88, 104, 155, 122]\nyour function would return: \n  2 5 # meaning the third movie (length 118) and the sixth movie (length 155) sum up to 273\n",
