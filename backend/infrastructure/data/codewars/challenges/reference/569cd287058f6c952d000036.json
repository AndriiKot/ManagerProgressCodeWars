    "description": "Your task is to create a function for brick layers so that they know how many bricks to buy and how much it is going to cost.\n\nThey will always be building a single brick width wall with standard sized bricks, which measure 215mm * 65mm and will also always use a 10mm mortar joint with herringbone structure (which means that the bricks are offset).\n\nYou will be given the desired height and width of the wall in meters.  The height of the wall will be rounded up to the nearest brick (including the mortar joints).  The width will be rounded down to the nearest brick (also including the mortar joint).\n\nIf only half of a brick is used at the edge of the wall you will need to break the brick in half and waste the unused half. You will also need to get at least an extra 10% on top of the needed amount to cover wastage.\n\nThe cost of the bags of bricks are as follows:\n\n-1000 bricks costs £105.99\n\n-100 bricks costs £44.95\n\n-10 bricks costs £9.99\n\nThe bags cannot be split.\n\nYour job is also to return the cheapest possible selection of bags of bricks to buy, regardless of waste.  \n\nYou will need to return a string telling the builder how many bricks to buy and how much it will cost, in the format:\n```\n\"Buy 10,000 bricks for £1,059,900.00\"\n```\n\nNotice that the numbers include commas to make them more readable and the cost is written to 2 decimal places.\n\n",
