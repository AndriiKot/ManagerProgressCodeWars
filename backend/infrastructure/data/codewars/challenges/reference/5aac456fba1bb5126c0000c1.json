    "description": "It's easy to calculate an average, but what good is that if you don't know how reliable your stats are?\n\nI will give you some data that I've collected. I need to know about the population my data came from. I don't just want the average of those numbers, though: I want a lower bound and an upper bound, so that I can be 95% certain that the true population mean is somewhere in that range.\n\n**Input**\n\nA vector of numeric data. You can assume the population distribution is approximately normal. My data is well-managed, so you don't have to worry about errors, and n is always larger than 1.\n    \n**Output**\n\nReturn a vector, containing a 95% confidence interval (lower bound and upper bound) for the population mean.\n\n*Hints:*\n\n- Remember, you don't know much about the true population, so treat the sample mean and standard deviation as estimates! In other words, use a t-test to calculate the confidence interval.\n\n- If you aren't very familiar with statistics, there are many detailed discussions about confidence intervals and t-tests on the internet (e.g., Wikipedia). Don't reinvent the wheel here, though. R is a language designed to make these things easy!\n",
