    "description": "The purpose of this Kata is given a point (x, y) in the plane to find all of its neighboring points in a given distance.\n\nFor example if the starting point is (0, 0) and the given distance is 1, we have 8 surrounding points lateral and diagonal:\n\n(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), \n(1, 0), (1, 1)\n\nNow if the distance is two we must need to take the second surrounding \"square\" of points around (0, 0) which consists of the following 16 surrounding points:\n\n(-2, -2), (-2, -1), (-2, 0), (-2, 1), (-2, 2), (-1, -2), (-1, 2), (0, -2), (0, 2), (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -2), \n(2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)\n\nSimilarly, if the distance around (0, 0) is three we need to take the third surrounding \"square\" which consists of 24 points. Do you already see a pattern? :)\n\nNow your job is to implement a class called neighbors which can be initialized with the starting point and can give us the neighboring points at a given distance.\n\nTo make it even more challenging, we want to support indexing and slicing in this class! For example neighbors[1] would give us all the 8 neighboring points of distance 1. \nThen, neighbors[1:3] would give us all the 8 neighboring points of distance one plus all the 16 neighboring points of distance two, so in total 24 neighboring points!\n\nSimilarly neighbors[1:4] would give us 48 points.\n\nThe returning points should be a list of tuples for example  [(0, 0), (1,1)]\n\nThe maximum distance around the point should be 1000.\n",
