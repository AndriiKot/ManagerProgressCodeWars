    "description": "Ellie is a swimmer, and she’s especially proud of her butterfly stroke (because let’s be honest, who isn’t when given a chance).\n\nThough she takes pride in the results she’s showing in the pool, Ellie has a very important meet coming up, and she wants to know if she will be able to improve her time even more. \n\nShe found a training routine that can help her improve her results each week by a curtain amount of seconds, so now our swimmer is wondering if it will be enough for her to achieve the goal result in time for the competition.\n\nYou will be given the following data:\n\n- Results Ellie is showing today (seconds) - ***current***\n- Result Ellie wants to be able to show at the competition (seconds) - ***goal***\n- Improvement Ellie can make each week (seconds) - ***improvement***\n- Number of weeks between now and the date of the meet - ***weeks***\n\nCurrent and desired results, as well as the weekly improvement, will be given in seconds. All input will be positive integers.\n\nYour task is to tell Ellie if she can achieve her goal time or is her plan way too ambitious. If the goal time can be reached - print out **\"Way to go, Ellie! You can do this!\"**, otherwise - print **\"Oops, seems like you’d need a bit more time\"**.",
