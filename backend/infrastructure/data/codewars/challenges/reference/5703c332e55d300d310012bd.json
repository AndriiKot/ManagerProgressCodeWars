    "description": "Those warriors who worked with Ruby on Rails are familiar with ActiveRecord.\nRails is built on MVC pattern where M stands for Model. Model describes an entity which has a corresponding table in database. ActiveRecord is actually ORM library. And today - you're going to build your own... kind of.\n\nWe are going to use not a real database but an imitation. There are two `Hashes` prepared for you: `DB` and `DB_SCHEMA`. The first one is our \"Database\" while the second will serve as a definition of \"tables\" and \"columns\" there (a.k.a `schema.rb`).\n\nHere is and example of database and it's schema after creating `Person` model and a corresponding table. \n\n\n````ruby\nDB_SCHEMA = { person: [:id, :name, :address] } # our \"DB schema\"\nDB = { person: [] } # \"DB\" itself\n````\n\n\n_**For the sake of simplicity we:**_\n\n- Do not mess with table name pluralization. Person model will have \"person\" table.\n- Do not care about data types.\n\n**All the required code to \"create tables\" is handled by kata.**\n\nYour job is to create a class `KataRecord` which will be our kind-of ORM and give any of its' subclasses these abilites:\n\n- create instance of model from parameters `Hash`. Note that you should only pass parameters that exist in this model's DB schema entry. You should also raise exception if provided argument is not a `Hash`.\n- get and set entity attributes using methods named after these attributes (ex: `person.name`, `person.name = \"Warrior\"`\n- find record by id (every Model will have id as a \"primary key\") using `find(id)` method. Keep in mind that 1st record should have ID == 1 or at least pretend to.\n- find record by any other attribute name using corresponding method (ex: Person has name so we can use `find_by_name(name)` method)\n- save record to database with autoincrementing ID\n- delete record from database\n\nGood luck!",
