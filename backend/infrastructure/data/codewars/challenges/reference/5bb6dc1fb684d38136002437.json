    "description": "You see a wall, and there's 99 bottles of beer on it! There also happens to be\n2 or more people near you (that means you can pass it around!) so what do you\ndo?\n\nThen what do you do?\n\nWrite a function called 'takeOneDownAndPassItAround' that takes one argument\ncalled 'numberOfPeopleNearYou' which represents the number of people near you\nnot including yourself.\n\n```javascript\nconst takeOneDownAndPassItAround = function(numberOfPeopleNearYou) {\n\n}\n```\n\nIf there is ever less than 2 other people near you your function should return:\n\n```javascript\n  'Not enough people to pass it around, find more people.'\n```\n(Sharing with 1 other person is passing back and forth, not around.)\n\nThis function should return the number of bottles of beer left on the\nwall after you take one down and pass it around (that means one less than was\nthere before the function was called).\n\nThe wall starts with 99 bottles of beer on it so:\n\n```javascript\n  takeOneDownAndPassItAround(6)\n```\nShould return 98\n\nIf the function is called consecutive times than it must return 1 less than the\nprevious call each time it is called until there are no bottles of beer left on\nthe wall.\n\nIf there are no bottles of beer left on the wall your function should return:\n```javascript\n  'Find another wall.'\n```\n\nHappy Coding!\n",
