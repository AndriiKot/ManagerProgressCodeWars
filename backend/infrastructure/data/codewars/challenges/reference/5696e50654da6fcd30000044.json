    "description": "It is a rare occasion to see Nessie, the Loch Ness Monster, emerge from the waters of Loch Ness. You are planning a trip to the Scottish Highlands and would like to know if there is a chance you will see Nessie.\n\nWhat do we know about Nessie? She is a creature of habit, and will only emerge once during a 100-day window, every 1500 days, and starting with 1937-07-30, we can determine these date ranges.  \nHere are the first three ranges:\n```\n1937-07-30 - 1937-11-06\n1941-09-07 - 1941-12-15\n1945-10-16 - 1946-01-23\n...\n```\nDefine a function willNessieEmerge that takes a date string in ISO 8601 format. Your function should return true/false depending on if the given date is in one of these date ranges (inclusive).",
