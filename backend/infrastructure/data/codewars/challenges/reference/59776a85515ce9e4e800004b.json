    "description": "Remember that one episode of spongebob where Spongebob and Patrick were leaving glove world and got on the wrong bus and ended up at Rock Bottom? If so, do you remember the creature that worked at the bus station, that talked like this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGTe9bLQNIE\n\nFor this challenge, you're going to create a function that translates plain english into the rock bottom accent that that creature has.\n\nThe function should take a string, and replace every space between the words with a 'PLHHHH', which is representative of the raspberry noise that he makes.\n\nFor example:\n```javascript\n   rockBottom(\"I cant understand your accent\") // => 'IPLHHHHcantPLHHHHunderstandPLHHHHyourPLHHHHaccent'\n  rockBottom('The next bus wont be coming until morning') // => 'ThePLHHHHnextPLHHHHbusPLHHHHwontPLHHHHbePLHHHHcomingPLHHHHuntilPLHHHHmorning'\n```",
