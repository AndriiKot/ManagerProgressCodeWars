    "description": "Alliteration is a term to describe a literary device in which a series of words begin with the same consonant sound. \n\nFor example: A hungry hippo helps happy horses hibernate.\n\nThis kata provides you a string, and the task is to determine if alliteration has been used. The function should respond with:\n0 - alliteration rules not followed\n1 - alliteration rules followed\n2 - alliteration rules followed, and over 5 words start with the correct sound\n\nWords of 3 or less letters (such as 'a', 'the', 'run' etc) can be considered as helper words and be used validly within the sentence, but be excluded from the word counting.\n\nNo numbers will be used, nor will punctuation. Same letters are tested, but not sounds (ie no \"fat pheasant\" or \"cool kitten\"). Your function needs to allow for extra spaces in the string.",
