    "description": "We all know every computer's favourite numeral system - the binary. Most of us probably heard of hexadecimal and octal as well. But how about some of their more exotic cousins?\n\nIn this kata your task is to write a function called `represent` that, given an integer `n` and another integer `base`, returns a string representation of `n` in a positional numeral system with base, um, `base`.\n\nExamples:\n```python\nrepresent(8, 2) == '1000'\nrepresent(24, 3) == '220'\nrepresent(12345, 13) == '5808'\nrepresent(41526331, 30) == '1l80b1'\n```\n\nIf you are unsure how the positional systems exactly work, go ahead and check the wiki article - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system.\n\nBe prepared for  `0 <= n <= 10^6` and `2 <= base <= 62`.\n\nAn important thing to mention is what order of symbols will we consider once we are beyond the realm of usual decimal representation. It's quite simple:\n\ndigits (0-9) < lowercase letters (a-z) < uppercase letters (A-Z)\n\nWhich gives us 62 different symbols per position (hence the upper limit of `base`).",
