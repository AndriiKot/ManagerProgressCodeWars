    "description": "Let us consider, as an example, strings like the following:\n```\ns='\"Title\"\nDate class\n.\n.\n\"Connected\"\nfifo,\nisoYear,\ndaynum,\nargfirst,\nmonthend,\nweeknum,\nassoc.quantity,\nyearstart,\nrank,\ntoday.'\nor:\ns=\"\\\"Title\\\"\\nDate class \\n.\\n.\\n\\\"Connected\\\"\\nfifo, \\nisoYear, \\ndaynum, \\nargfirst, \\nmonthend, \\nweeknum, \\nassoc.quantity, \\nyearstart, \\nrank, \\ntoday.\"\n```\n`s` has two parts; the first one before `\"Connected\" ` (between double quotes) can include any substrings, the second one after `\"Connected\"` includes substrings separated by comma and white-space(s), on one or several lines.\n\nWe want to transform `s` into the following string ` t`:\n```\nt='\"Title\"\nDate class\n.\n.\n\"Connected\"\n 1 argfirst\n 2 assoc.quantity\n 3 daynum\n 4 fifo\n 5 isoYear\n 6 monthend\n 7 rank\n 8 today\n 9 weeknum\n10 yearstart.\nor:\nt=\"\\\"Title\\\"\\nDate class \\n.\\n.\\n\\\"Connected\\\"\\n 1 argfirst\\n 2 assoc.quantity\\n 3 daynum\\n 4 fifo\\n 5 isoYear\\n 6 monthend\\n 7 rank\\n 8 today\\n 9 weeknum\\n10 yearstart.\"\n```\n`t` has two parts. The only difference between `s` and `t` is that in `t` all substrings following `\"Connected\"` are in alphabetical order, each on its own line, without duplicates and preceded by their ranks in the second part of `t` (these numbers are in a field of two, right aligned, followed by a space).\n\n#### Task\nLet us call `trans` the function with parameter `s` which transforms `s` into `t`.\nThe parameter `s` will always be a string including the substring `\"Connected\"`. What you have to do to get `t` is to reproduce the first part of `s`, keep `\"Connected\"`, get the substrings of the second part of `s` in \n- alphabetical order, \n- each on its own line, \n- without duplicates \n- and preceded by their ranks in the second part of `t`.\n\n#### Notes:\n- The first part of `t` is the same as in `s`. \n- `s` and `t` end with a dot.\n- You can see more examples in \"RUN\".\n- Please ask before translating.",
