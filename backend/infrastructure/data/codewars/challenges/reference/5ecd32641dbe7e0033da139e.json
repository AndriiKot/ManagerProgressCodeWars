    "description": "You are given a black box that takes two arbitrary numbers M and N as input and returns the number (N - M) / N.\n\nInitially, you have the numbers X, Y, and π. You can get new numbers by applying a black box to existing ones (any number can be used as many times as you like).\n\nWrite 4 functions:\n\n- plus(X,Y) which returns X + Y\n- minus(X,Y) which returns X - Y\n- multiply(X,Y) which returns X * Y\n- divide(X,Y) which returns X / Y\n\nYou can't use arithmetic operators. \n\nAll you have is:\n\n- black box(N,M) which can calculate (N-M)/N\n- X, Y, and π\n\nYou have to simulate arithmetic operators by combining black box calls.\n\n",
