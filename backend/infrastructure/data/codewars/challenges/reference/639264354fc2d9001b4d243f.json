    "description": "You and a friend have created a guessing game.   In this game, one friend chooses a range and a number within that range.   The other friend attempts to guess the number by making guesses and receiving feedback from the first friend on whether each guess is too big, too small, or correct.   If the second friend uses more guesses than necessary, they lose the game.\n\nYou have decided to play this game on the internet.   To do this, you need to create a function that receives a port number, the lower bound of the range, and the upper bound of the range.   The function should then connect to that port in tcp protocol send guesses over the port until it finds the correct number, at which point it will finish execution\n\nThe server will respond with \"your guess is too small\" if the guess is lower than the chosen number.  \nThe server will respond with \"your guess is too big\" if the guess is higher than the chosen number.  \nThe server will respond with \"your guess is correct!\" if the guess is the chosen number, and it will then close the connection.  \n\nthe server is located on local host\nthe range is inclusive at both ends\n",
