    "description": "Vampires do not like daylight. In this Kata you will need to find the shadows where Vampires will like to hide.\n\nFor this Kata you will be given the position of the Sun (either \"W\"est or \"E\"ast) and a city map.\n\nThe City Map will be a list of numbers, with each number representing the height of a particular building. Heights will be positive integers only.\n\nEx.: (1,3,4,2) means a city of 4 buldings. The first has a height of 1, the second a height of 3, the third a height of 4 and the fourth a height of 2.\n\nIf the sun is \"W\" (shining from left to right) the first 3 buildings will be facing the sun. But the last building, with height 2, will be in the shadow.\n\nBut if the sun is \"E\" (shining from right to left), then buildings 1 and 2 will be in the shadow.\n\nFor each city map, return a list with all the possible hideouts for a Vampire (ordered West to East). Buildings start at 1 (not 0). If there are no hideouts in the shadow return an empty list [].\n\nEx.: (\"W\", [1, 8, 4, 9, 7]) -> [3,5]\n",
