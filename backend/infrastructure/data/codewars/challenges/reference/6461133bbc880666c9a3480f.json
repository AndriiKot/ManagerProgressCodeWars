    "description": "# Group hours together!\n\nYou are the manager of a shop in France that changes its opening hours **every day**!\n\nThe new timetables come directly from corporate as a list of opened hours. **Your job is to transform this list into a readble message for your shop's customers!**\n\n## Examples:\n\n- ``[9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19]`` will translate to ``Heures d'ouvertures du jour : 09:00-11:00, 12:00-13:00, 15:00-17:00, 19:00-20:00``\n- ``[12, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20]`` will translate to ``Heures d'ouvertures du jour : 12:00-13:00, 14:00-15:00, 17:00-21:00``\n\n\"Heures d'ouvertures du jour\" stands for \"Today's opening hours\" in french!\n\n## Notes:\n\n- As you've probably guessed, the time is in 24 hours format in France!\n- The list will always be in ascending order, from minimum ``00:00`` to maximum ``00:00`` (you'll have to handle the ``24:00`` case!)\n- Only group hours that are 1 hour seperated from each other\n- All range of hours should be formatted this way: ``hh:00-hh-00``\n- The beginning of the message should always start with ``Heures d'ouvertures du jour : ``\n\n# Bonne chance !",
