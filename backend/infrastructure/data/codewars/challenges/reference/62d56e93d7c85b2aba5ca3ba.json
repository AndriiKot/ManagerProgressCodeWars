    "description": "# Coding Coins\n\nThe local coding competition has the following points system:\n- The team that solves a problem gets a coin.\n- The first team to solve a problem gets an additional coin.\n\nA contest has 26 problems, labelled 𝖠, 𝖡, 𝖢, ..., 𝖹 and every time a team solves a problem, a logging mechanism appends the problem label to a string called `problemsSolved`.\n\nAfter finishing the contest, organizers want to know how many coins should have been given to the teams.\n\nNotice that no team solve a problem twice and some problems may be solved by none of them.\n\nYour task is to determine the total number of coins the teams received given the `problemsSolved` string.\n\n# Example (input -> output)\n\n```\nRSR -> 5\nA -> 2\nORZ -> 6\nANNNN -> 7\nBKPT -> 8\n```",
