    "description": "  The Griswolds can't seem to keep their station wagon on the road with tires blowing out every time they leave the house. Despite some neglectful driving and erattic behavior Mr. Griswold thinks its the less than reputable tire company, TireTime, passing him off with faulty tires. In order to determine this the fam decides to get analytical about it demands that TireTime start giving them quality inspection reports on each batch the 4 new tires come from, since if one was defective they all must be defective and need to be replaced. Complying the TireTime starts gladly providing the test reports from each test set of tires from the factory, but since this company can be cheap at times the test can vary dramatically in number from 10 to 300 tires per batch.\n\n  To help them out they get you to write up a quick script to calculate the chance that one tire will blow out on the ride home from the tireshop based on the number of tires in each test set and the number of tires that failed during testing. If the probability that one does is greater that the chance of a coin flip then the Griswolds were right and they need to get their money back and spend a little extra to get better tires. Otherwise Mr. Griswold need to calm his foot and drive a little safer. \n  \n  The goal of this kata will be to determine the chance of failure for one out of four tire on any given ride for Griswolds and return \"Ed, these aren't the tires I ordered\" if the chance is greater that 50% else \"Dad, we must have jump those rails by 50 yards!\" if Mr. Griswolds just being a maniac given the number of tires tested for that batch (TestTires) and the number of tires that failed from that test set (FailedTires). Eleven test cases will be provided for examples.",
