    "description": "#Preview\n\nPaul is stressed. He only has few days left until his final exam. There a still several topics to be covered and he hasn't started to prepare yet.\nLuckily a friend will be able to provide a list of topics in the exam with the the required hours to study to master a topic and the number of short and long questions regarding each topic.<br>\nCurrently he's trying to collect his thoughts and develop a plan of which topics he should focus on and the number of hours he should study for each topic to get the best possible grade.\n\n#Problem\n\nThe exam consists of two long questions worth 30% of the total points each and four short questions worth 10% of total points each.\nThe topics will be passed on to the function as an array of objects with properties for the number of short and long questions on the topic and the number of hours required to fully master the topic.<br> \nIf Paul invests less than required hours in a topic he will be able to get points equivalent to the proportion of the total hours. For example if he studies 20 of the 30 hours required to master a topic he will receive 2/3 of the points on those questions.<br>\nOn average Paul can study 12 hours per day and the number of days will be given as a parameter to the function.\n\nEach topic will be passed as an object of the following format:\n```javascript\n{name: \"Algebra\", longQ: 1, shortQ: 0, hours: 40}\n```\n\nThe answer should be an array of strings with the studyplan for Paul indicating the subjects and the number of hours he should study for them. The strings should be sorted by starting with the most efficient subjects to study on first.\n\nFor example:\n```javascript\n[\"10 hours for Weird Equations\",\n\"30 hours for Geometrie\",\n\"20 hours for Algebra\"]\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
