    "description": "You sent your best spy to Canada and you haven't heard from her in weeks! You've tried calling, texting, and sending letters, all with no reply.\n\nJust when you are about to give up, you receive a secret message. Unfortunately, it's all garbled. You think you recognize a few characters here and there, but you can't be sure.\n\nIf only there were a way to extract just the message from the text, maybe you could decode it!\n\nFill in the function \"decode\" so that it returns only the numbers and letters in the message \"secret\".",
