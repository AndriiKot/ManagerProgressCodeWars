    "description": "Everybody know the problem:\n\nYour salesmanager come to you and say \"Oh, recently on the toilet, i've got a great idea. Our new price for our new product is 7.90 $ incl. VAT\". Now you're an intelligent Programmer and know, this price would produce problems if you'll calculate it to an net price.\n\n```\n7.90 $ / 1.0889 = 7.255 $ = 7.26 $\n\n7.26 $ * 1.0889 = 7.905 $ = 7.91 $ <= Ehhhh, you failed!\n```\n\nThe goal is:\nWrite an algorhytmus, which rounds +-1 penny to ten (see example above).\nIf the price is lower than 5 $, round additionally +-1 cent from fifth to next fifth ( ex. 3,04 $ => 3,05 $ ).\nIf the price lower than 2 $ do nothing.\n\n## NOTE !\nFloating numbers may inaccurate. Use Integers while calculation and then divide by 100. ;-)\n\nHave fun :-)",
