    "description": "A recent downturn in the contract killing market has led to a lot of ninjas being laid off, sitting at home, eating hamburgers and watching game shows. As such they have become overweight, and addicted to junk food and game shows. Naturally many of those unemployed Ninjas are interested in a game show that promises a life-time supply of hamburgers for anyone who is able to use ninja-like stealth to cross a square hall without triggering any of strategically installed laser sensors. \n\nThe square hall is laid out as a grid of 1 metres by 1 metres squares. The lasers are attached to the ceiling and shoot their beams straight down to a sensor on the ground. Each of the laser beams has zero width and will set off an alarm if a contestant touches its sensor. Each contestant must enter the hall from its left side, move their entire girth across the hall and completely through the right side without crossing the top or bottom walls. It is not sufficient just to touch the right side.\n\nThe game show host would like the sensors to be arranged so that very fat ninjas will find it difficult to succeed. Your task is to write a program to compute the girth of the fattest ninja that could succeed in crossing the hall for each proposal of sensors' arrangement. Your program should assume that the ninjas are perfect circles when viewed from above, and that the ninjas are too overweight to jump off the floor.\n\n## Input\n - `size` represents the square hall's side in metres \n - `lazers` is an array of arrays of `x`,`y` positions of each lazer\n\nLazers will always be positioned within the room: `0 < x,y < size`\n\n## Output\nYou should return a floating point number, which represents the diameter of the fattest ninja that can move through the hall without touching any of the laser sensors. The diameter is to be rounded to three decimal places.\n\n> **Reminder: Rounding a positive number R.xxxy to three decimal places**\n\n> If the fourth decimal place is less than 5, then the rounded value is `R.xxx`. Otherwise, the rounded value is `R.xxx + 0.001`.\n\n> Examples are: for the value of 10.3463 the output should be 10.346, and for the value of 10.3695 the output is 10.370",
