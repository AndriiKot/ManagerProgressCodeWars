    "description": "Because we are such good rubyists, we want to implement a hash where symbols and strings are treated the same (i.e. `'foo'` is the same as `:foo`). This way we can save time typing:\n\n```ruby\nhash[:foo] = 'bar'\nputs hash['foo']  # => bar\n```\n\nYour job is to implement the `HashWithIndifferentAccess` class, which does just that.\n\nWe also want to add the following criteria to our implementation:\n\n* This must extend the Hash class\n* This must *not* tamper with any non-String or non-Symbol keys\n\nAlso, because we love Ruby magic, we also want to monkey patch the Hash class to make it indifferent:\n\n```ruby\nh = { a: 'apple' }.with_indifferent_access\nputs h['a'] # => apple\n```\n\nBonus points if you don't cheat and look at the ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess documentation!",
