    "description": "Given an array of arrays containing number types as the first argument and an unrestricted number of math operations ('+' for addition, '-' for subtraction, '\\*' for multiplication, and '/' for division) for the remaining arguments, create a function 'alternateOps' that reduces each nested array according to the order in which the operations are passed into said function. The reduced value of each inner array will accumulate with the reduced value of the next inner array using the operation of the former array. If there are more nested arrays than there are number of operations, reuse operations starting from the beginning.\n\nIf no operations are passed in, reduce all arrays by adding them together.\n\nBe careful not to divide your rolling sum by zero! If this occurs, simply skip the operation and continue on to the next array. Return you answer rounded to the hundreths place. \n\nExamples:\n\n```\nalternateOps([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], '+', '-') => (1 + 2 + 3) + (4 - 5 - 6) => 6 + -7 = -1\n\nalternateOps([[1,2,3], [5,6,7], [8, 9, 10, 11]], '-', '+') => (1 - 2 - 3) - (5 + 6 + 7) + (8 - 9 - 10 - 11) => -4 - 18 + -22 = -44\n\nalternateOps([[-42, 39, 170], [5,6,7]], '*', '/') => (-42 * 39 * 170) * (5 / 6 / 7) => -278460 * 0.11904761904 => -33150\n\nalternateOps([[1,2,3], [4,5,6,0], [6, 5, 6]], '/', '*') => (1 / 2 / 3) / (4 * 5 * 6 * 0) * (6 / 5 / 6) => (1 / 6) * (1 / 5) => 0.03\n\nalternateOps([[1,2,3], [4,5,6,0], [6, 5, 6]]) => (1 + 2 + 3) + (4 + 5 + 6 + 0) + (6 + 5 + 6) => 6 + 15 + 17 => 38\n\n```\n\nFeedback and suggestions welcomed.\n",
