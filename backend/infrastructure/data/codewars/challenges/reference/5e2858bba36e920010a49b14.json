    "description": "As a costumer you want to check online, if the products you are looking for are available.\n\nYour task is to write a function with two lists as input and where the customer can instantly see the available number of the products he is looking for.\nThe lists are looking like this: \n\n* products: `[['Laptop', 'Tablet', 'Headset']`\n* amount: `[0, 1, 22]`\n\nThere are three cases, \n* one is, the product is zero times available. Then the output should be `Laptops are not available`\n* In the second case there is only one of this product left. The output should be `There is 1 Tablet available`\n* The last case is the most common case, more than 1 of this Product is available. The output should be `There are 22 Headsets available`\n\n**Note**: Write the solution in an array/list and be aware of Laptop and Laptop**s** the input is singular",
