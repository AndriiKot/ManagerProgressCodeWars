    "description": "a organization have `n` employess numbered from 1 to `n`, we want to divide it two 2 team, each team should not empty, but their number of employes can be unequal. each employes must belong to a team.\n\nfor a group, its known they will work more efficient if all member in a group are on the same team.\nthere are `m` groups, the `ith` of which consist `ki` employees and has a efficiency level `fi`\neach group all of whose members are on the same team,add `fi` to the total efficiency level.\n\nFind the maximum possible total efficient level.\n\nExplanation\n\nThere m group, they are `G1 = {1,2}, G2 = {1,3}, G3 = {2,3,4}` and their efficiency level = `f1 = 4, f2 = 5, f3 = 10`. There many possible way to select two team. Here some of the possible\n\n`{1,2} {3,4}` One team contain `G1` and the other team contain no group.total efficiency = `f1=4`\n`{1,2,3} {4}` One team contain `G1 and G2` and the other team contains no group. so its total efficiency is `f1 + f2 = 9`\n`{2,3} {1,4}` Both team contain no group.\n`{1} {2,3,4}` One team contain `G3` group, and the other team contain no group. total efficiency is `f3 = 10`\n\nWhat if two group with same employees, but different efficiency?\nfor a example\n`n = 4` `m = 3`\n`G1 = [1,2,3] F = 5`\n`G2 = [1,2,3] F = 10`\n`G3 = [4] F = 4`\nthis means that (effectively) you have 2 groups:\n`G1 = [1 2 3], F=15`\n`G2 = [4] F=4`",
