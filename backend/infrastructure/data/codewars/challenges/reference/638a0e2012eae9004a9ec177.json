    "description": "A chessboard configuration can be described using an 8x8 grid (array of 8 strings, each being 8 characters long):\n\n```\n[0] RNBQKBNR\n[1] PPPPPPPP\n[2] ........\n[3] ........\n[4] ........\n[5] ........\n[6] pppppppp\n[7] rnbqkbnr\n```\n\nThe case of the letter determines the player\n\n```\nPieces:\nP = Pawn\nR = Rook\nN = Knight\nB = Bishop\nQ = Queen\nK = King\n. = Empty square\n```\n\nFor simplicity, this can be reduced to a 64-character string:\n\n`RNBQKBNRPPPPPPPP........................................pppppppprnbqkbnr`\n\n```\n```\n\n__Write 2 functions__:\n\n_compress_\n\nCompress a chessboard configuration string into an array of bits (an array of numbers, each being 0 or 1)\n\n_deCompress_\n\ndecompress a bit array (that the compress function provides) and return the original 64-character chessboard configuration string\n\nA constant called _targetCompressionBitArraySize_ is also required\n- This is used when performing tests\n- It is also used to show how effective your method is as your submission will clearly show your level of compression\n- You determine the best compression method. It is possible to compress to 156 bits (maybe less)\n- The result of the compress function must *always* return the same size array of bits regardless of the input string\n\nIn the chess configuration string:\n- all 32 chess pieces will appear\n- all 32 empty squares will appear\n\nThe board configuration may not be one that is physically possible during a game (for the tests the board contents are simply shuffled - pieces are not legally moved)\n",
