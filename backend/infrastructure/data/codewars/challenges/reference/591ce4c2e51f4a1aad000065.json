    "description": "Your friend Aisha gives you two potentially very large distinct prime numbers, call them `p` and `q`. She tells you to multiply the two numbers together such that you have `n = p*q`.  \nAisha wants to know what is the probability of picking a number `k` from `1` to `n` `(1,2,...,n)` where the greatest common denominator of `k` and `n` is not one(`1`), in other words, where `k` and `n` are not relatively prime.  \nCan you help her out?\n\nImportant note: express the probability as a percentage rounded to the nearest percent (i.e. `0.3567` is equivalent to `35.67%`, so you should return `36`).",
