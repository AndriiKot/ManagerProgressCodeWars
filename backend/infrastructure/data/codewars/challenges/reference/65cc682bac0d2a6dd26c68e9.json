    "description": "Give you a sentence consisting of several words separated by Spaces. Each word consists of only upper and lower case English letters.\n\nPlease convert the sentence to \"Goat Latin\" (a fictional language similar to Pig Latin). The rules of goat Latin are as follows:\n\n·If the word begins with a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'), add \"ma\" after the word.\n·For example, the word \"apple\" becomes \"applema\".\n\n·If the word begins with a consonant (i.e., non-vowel), remove the first character and put it at the end, then add \"ma\".\n·For example, the word \"goat\" became \"oatgma\".\n\n·According to the word's index in the sentence, add the same number of letters 'a' at the end of the word as the index, which starts at 1.\n·For example, add \"a\" after the first word, \"aa\" after the second word, and so on.\n\nReturns the sentence converted to goat Latin.",
