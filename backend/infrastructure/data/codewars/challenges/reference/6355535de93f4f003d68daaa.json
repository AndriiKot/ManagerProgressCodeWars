    "description": "This is a classic problem asked by some companies like Amazon and Google.\n\nYou are given a list of positive integers ```a(i), a(i+1), a(i+2), ..., a(n)``` where each one of them represents the height of a column in the x position ```i```.\nFind two columns, which together with x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.\n\nThe program should return an integer which corresponds to the maximum area of water that can be contained.\n\nExample:\n\nIn this figure you recieve as input: ```[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]``` which should return 49.\n![image title](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)\n\n\nThe test cases will be as follows:\n\n```600``` tests of ```1 < length(list) <= 10^4```\nwhere ```1 < list[i] <= 10^4```\n\nDon't forget to leave you thoughts about the kata! :)\n\nGood luck!\n",
