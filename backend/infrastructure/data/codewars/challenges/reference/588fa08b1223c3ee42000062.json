    "description": "Create a password hashing function that turns any 1-20 character string into a hash.\n\nYou are free to design any hashing function you please as long as you follow the guidelines:\n\n1) Hashes should be always 8 characters long.\n\n2) Hashes shouldn't resemble the input:\n\n```javascript\n// returns 's3cr3tAA' which resembles the original too much!\nvar hashed = badHash('secret');\n\n// returns 'XMDERT21' which doesn't resemble the original, except for length\nvar hashed = betterHash('secret');\n```\n\n3) Hashing the same input should result in the same result:\n```javascript\n// results in 'af12FKla'\nvar hashed = badHash('secret');\n\n// the next call result is 'af12FKl1'\nvar hashed = badHash('secret');\n\n// this should return true:\nbetterHash('secret') == betterHah('secret')\n\n```\n\n4) Hashes of two slightly differing passwords shouldn't look similar:\n\n```javascript\n// returns 'abcf12le'\nvar hash1 = badHash('secret_1');\n\n// returns 'abcf12li'\nvar hash2 = badHash('secret_2');\n\n// returns 'abcf12le'\nvar hash3 = goodHash('secret_1');\n\n// returns 'cdaf2fAG'\nvar hash4 = goodHash('secret_2');\n\n\n```\n\nDuring the final test, there should be less than 3 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_(computer_science)\">collisions</a> among the 25,000 generated hashes:\n\n```javascript\n// results in 'cd12mal0'\nvar hashed1 = badHash('word1');\n\n// also results in 'cd12mal0' which is a collision\nvar hashed2 = badHash('word2');\n```\n\nYour hashing function will be tested for collisions on a randomly generated array of 25,000 strings. Your algorithm is allowed to create at most 3 collisions. Anything above that will make the tests fail.\n\n\nNote: In real life, implementing your own password hashing functions is not a good idea. Always rely on the work of people who are skilled in cryptography - your unique solution here is likely to have multiple vulnerabilities which would make it unsafe to use in real products. Treat this kata just as a fun exercise.",
