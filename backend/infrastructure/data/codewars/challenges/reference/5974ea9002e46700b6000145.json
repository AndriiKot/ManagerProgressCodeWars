    "description": "**You must use the .reduce() method within your answer**\n\n### Three sisters run Goodness Gracious Green (a shop selling all things green and lovely). \n\nSince opening, they've struggled to agree on the sale cost of products. One believes costs should be kept as low as possible, the middle sister wants to keep an average price and the eldest thinks that they should charge more for their one-of-a-kind green things. \n\nYour task is to create a function called bestPrice which will take an array of 3 prices which should be averaged to return the best and final price. \n\nWith your help the sisters can put an end to their fights once and for all!\n\n\n**Things to note:**\n- Prices will be in pence and cannot be negative\n- Prices will be given as a number, not a string\n- You must use the .reduce() method within your answer\n",
