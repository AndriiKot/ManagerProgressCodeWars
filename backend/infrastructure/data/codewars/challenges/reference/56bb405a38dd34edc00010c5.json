    "description": "This Kata is for those who prefer the long to the short: irrational to rational, binary to decimal, and military to standard time! Your job, given a date in String format as follows: <code>MM/DD/YYYY</code>, is to return how many minutes have passed since the start of the year. Assume that the date given has passed in full. If the date you are given is not valid, return -1. Hint: You also have to keep track of leap years!",
