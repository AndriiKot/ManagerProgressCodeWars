    "description": "# Word Transformer\n\nGiven two words, a start word, and an end word, along with a list of valid words (dictionary), the task is to find a sequence of transformations from the start word to the end word. A transformation sequence involves changing one letter at a time with each transformed word being present in the given dictionary.\n\nAssume that not all input will be valid, and each word in the dictionary will match the length of `start_word` and `end_word`\n\n## Rules\n\n1. Words in the dictionary are lowercase and consist only of alphabetical characters.\n2. The transformation sequence must follow these rules:\n    * At each step, only one letter can be changed.\n    * Each transformed word must exist in the dictionary.\n    * The length of the start and end words will be the same.\n    \n## Demonstration\n\nConsider the following case:\n\nStart word: `\"hit\"`\n\nEnd word: `\"cog\"`\n\nDictionary: `[\"hot\", \"dot\", \"dog\", \"lot\", \"log\", \"cog\"]`\n\nA valid transformation sequence from \"hit\" to \"cog\" can be:\n\n\"hit\" -> \"hot\" -> \"dot\" -> \"dog\" -> \"cog\"\n\nExample test case:\n```rust\nword_transformer(\"lead\", \"gold\", &[\"lead\", \"load\", \"goad\", \"gold\"])\n// vec![\"lead\", \"load\", \"goad\", \"gold\"]\n```\n\n## Notes\n* Not all start and end words will have valid transformation sequences. If there is no valid transformation sequence, an empty list is returned.\n* The transformation sequence should adhere to the rules mentioned above, considering each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary.",
