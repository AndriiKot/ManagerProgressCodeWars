    "description": "Who didn't dream about dinosaurs combats???\n\nSo here we will make two dinosaurs face each other and fight to death!!\n\nWe know all what we need to declare the winner, wich obviusly is the name, weight and height.\n\nSo, we have Dinosaur class with 3 properties:\n  - String name\n  - Integer weight\n  - Integer height\n  \nWith their getters especified like that:\n  - Java: getName(), getWeight() and getHeight().\n\nAnd also a setters (wich will be usefull):\n  - Java: setName(String name), setWeight(Integer weight), setHeight(Integer height).\n\nObviusly the winner is determined by this rules:\n  - The dinosaur wich have more weight, wins. If they have the same weight         then...\n  - The dinosaur wich have more height, wins. If they have the same height         then...\n  - The dinosaur with the shortest name wins. Yes, thats it.\n  \nYour job here is to code a function wich determinates the winner of a dinosaur combat. The result must be a string like this: \"dinosaurX destroyed dinosaurY\" if we have a winner or \"They destroyed each other!!\" if we have a tie!\n\nNotes:\n  - Dinosaur arguments will never be null (Java) but it may content some null properties values. If that happends you must think that \"any value\" > null.\n  - If one or more of the names of the dinosaurs are empty or null you must complete the answer with \"unknown dinosaur\". Example: \"T-Rex destroyed unknown dinosaur\" or \"unknown dinosaur destroyed T-Rex\".\n\nEnjoy!",
