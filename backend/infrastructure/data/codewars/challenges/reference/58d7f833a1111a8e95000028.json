    "description": "Edit distance is the minimum number of steps to get from one word to another.\n\nA step is defined by:\n\n1. Deletion of one character anywhere in the string\n2. Insertion of one character anywhere in the string\n3. Replacement of one character anywhere in the string\n\nFor example, EditDistance(\"sunday\", \"saturday\") could resolve in the following way:\n\n1. sunday -> surday\n2. surday -> sturday\n3. sturday -> saturday\n\nresulting in a minumum edit distance of 3, as that is the minimum amount of steps.\n\nWrite a function that takes in the two words and returns the edit distance, and is efficient enough only to not timeout. (Brute force solution is acceptable)\n\n\n",
