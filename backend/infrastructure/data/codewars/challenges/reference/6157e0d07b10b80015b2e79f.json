    "description": "COVID life is boring.\n\nSo, Tom starts thinking mundane things.\n\nOne thing that he wonders is: \"how many days will this toothpaste tube last me?\"\n\nA toothpaste tube depletes as Tom uses it (obviously).\n\nAn example toothpaste tube, that is partly depleted, is represented as a string:\n```\n\"||||||||.........\"\n```\n\nThe ```|``` represents one unit of toothpaste left in the tube.  The ```.``` represents an empty space in the tube.\n\nLet ```n``` be the amount of units of toothpaste that Tom uses, per day.  Assume he brushes twice per day.\n\nHow many days will the toothpaste tube last?\n\nExample 1:\n\n```toothpasteCalc(\"||||||||.........\", 5)``` should return 1\n\nAfter first day, the tube looks like this:\n\n```\"|||..............\"```\n\nThe tube would only have 3 units left, after which Tom must throw it away, since it's not enough for the 2nd day.\n\nExample 2:\n\n```toothpasteCalc(\"|||||||||...\", 2)``` should return 4\n\nAfter 4 days, Tom would have used 8 units of toothpaste.  The tube would only have 1 unit left, after which Tom must throw it away, since it's not enough for the 5th day.\n\nCheck basic test cases for more examples.\n\n\nNOTE: Not all information in this problem statement is necessary to complete this kata! ;).\n\nNOTE: Usage per day will always be greater than 0.\n\nNOTE: The toothpaste tube string will always be greater than 0 in length.",
