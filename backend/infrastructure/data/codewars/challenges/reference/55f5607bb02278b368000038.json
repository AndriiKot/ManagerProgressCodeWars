    "description": "Create a function that returns the average mileage in miles per gallon since last time the function was called.\n\nIt is assumed that the speed changes linearly between two observations. Each new calculation must use the currently supplied arguments as well as the ones supplied last time. The function must work being called several times, not just twice.\n\nThe arguments to the function are `time`, `speed`, and `gas`.\n\ntime: The current time as a `Date` object.\n\nspeed: The current speed in miles per hour.\n\ngas: The current amount of fuel in the tank in gallons.\n\nIf the function is called with a `time` argument that is smaller than the last time the function was called, an error should be thrown.\n\nA negative `speed`, or `gas` should also result in an error.",
