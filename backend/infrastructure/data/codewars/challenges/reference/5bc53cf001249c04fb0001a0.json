    "description": "A group of cells are arranged in a straight line. Each day the state of each cell depends on its adjacent cells' state (neighbours).\nAn integer value of 1 represents an active cell, and value of 0 represents an inactive cell.\nIf both neighbours are either active or inactive the cell becomes inactive the next day; otherwise it becomes active.\nThe two cells at the ends have a single adjacent cell, so the other adjacent state can be assumed to be always inactive. Even after updating the cell state its previous state is considered for updating the state of other cells.\n\nWrite an algorithm to output the state of the cells after a given number of days.\n##Input\ntwo arguments:\n-states: array of integers representing the current state of the cells. Only 0s and 1s. Size of array will be 3 as the smallest.\n-days: an integer representing the number of days. positive number.\n\n##Output\nreturn an aray of integers representing the state of the cells after a given number of days",
