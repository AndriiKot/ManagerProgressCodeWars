    "description": "# Story\n\nA dishonest manager of a transportation company has a deal with a fuel supplier, and is interested in its maximum consumption. There are `N` cities located at equal distance from each other along a linear road. Help him plan such route that maximizes the overall travelled distance.\n\n___\n\n## Input\n\n* Number of cities\n\n## Output\n\n* Maximum distance that can be travelled\n\n___\n\n## Visual example\n\nA map with 5 cities:\n\n```\nCity #1        City #2        City #3        City #4        City #5\nV              V              V              V              V\n█______________█______________█______________█______________█\n  <- 1 unit ->   <- 1 unit ->   <- 1 unit ->   <- 1 unit ->\n```\n\n___\n\n## Notes\n\n* The distance between any two neighboring cities is `1 unit`.\n* The driver always starts in one of the cities.\n* The driver can start in any of the cities.\n\n```if:c,cpp\nBig input values will be tested. Using an incorrect approach will lead to overflowing the output data type.\n```",
