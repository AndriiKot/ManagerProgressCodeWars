    "description": "According to Wikipedia, an armstrong number is any number that is equal to the digits raised to the power of the amount of digits in the number summed. Armstrong numbers are also called narcissistic numbers, plus perfect numbers, or a pluperfect digital invariants. They are part of number theory.\n\nFor example, the number `153` has `3` digits. All digits raised to the power of `3` are `1^3 = 1`, `5^3 = 125`, and `3^3 = 27`. These numbers added together equal `153`, so the number `153` is an armstrong number.\n\nAnother example is the number `1634`. There are `4` digits, so all digits are raised to the power of `4`: `1^4 = 1`, `6^4 = 1296`, `3^4 = 81`, and `4^4 = 256`. All of these numbers summed is `1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1634`. Therefore, 1634 is also an armstrong number.\n\nEvery ArmstrongNumber instance is created with a number, `N`. Use `N` to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number or not.\n\nConstraints:\n`0 <= N < 5,000,000`",
