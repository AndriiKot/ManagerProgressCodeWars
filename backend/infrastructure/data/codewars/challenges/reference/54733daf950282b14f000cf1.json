    "description": "A game map is represented by a 2d array containing only integers, and can be a grid of any size. Each number in the 'map' represents an entity:\n\n```\n0 is an empty space\n1 is the player\n2 is a wall or object that can not be passed\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\nmap = [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nWould be a map with the player at ```map[0][2]``` and 3 walls/objects at ```map[1][2], map[2][2] and map[3][2]```.\n\nYour task is to implement a method ```find_path(map, end_point)``` which finds the most efficient path from the players position to the given end_point for the given map, moving only up, down, left or right.\n\nThere are a few noteable exceptions, which will require you to return an empty array ```[]``` i.e. there is no possible path. These are:\n```\nNo player exists on the map (1)\nThe end_point location is already occupied with a wall/object (2)\nIt is impossible to create a path from the player to the end point\nA nil end_point is given\nThe end_point is out of bounds of the map array\n```\n\nIn all other cases a path should be returned as a 2d array, where the values are the co-ordinates for each step taken on the path, for example:\n```ruby\nmap = [[0, 1, 2, 0, 0]]\nfind_path(map, [0, 4]) # Should return [] as it is impossible.\nfind_path(map, [0, 0]) # Should return [[0, 0]]\nmap = [[0, 1],\n       [0, 0]]\nfind_path(map, [1, 0]) # Should return [[0, 0], [1, 0]] or [[1,1],[1,0]] depending on your code\nmap = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]\nfind_path(map, [1, 2]) # Should return [] as the end_point tile is occupied.\nfind_path(map, [0, 2]).length # Should be 6, as the path is 6 steps.\nfind_path(map, [0, 2]) # Should return either [[4,1],[3,1],[2,1],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2]] or [[4,3],[3,3],[2,3],[1,3],[0,3],[0,2]] depending on your code\n```",
