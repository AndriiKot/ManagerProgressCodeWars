    "description": "To the rest of the world, the American Imperial units system is an oddity that can only lead to distaster (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#Cause_of_failure)\n\nTo measure lenghts involves not only a different set of base units (Feet, inches etc) which are not decimaly divided (12s, 16s etc), but also using dyadic rationals (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyadic_rational)\n\nGiven a lenght in millimeter and an accuracy level n, you must return the lenght in feet and inches, with the fraction of inch displayed dyadically.\n\n1 inch is 25.4mm\n\nThe accuracy level means:\nn = 0 => rounded to the nearest inch\nn = 1 => rounded to the nearest half-inch\n.\n.\nn = 5 => rounded to the nearest 32th of an inch\n\nFollow the test examples for the formatting required.\nAn empty string must be returned if the rounded result is 0 or less than the accuracy level.\n\n",
