    "description": "A convex polygon is a polygon, in which all internal angles are less than or equal to 180°. Examples of convex polygons are rectangle, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon etc. Depending on the number of vertices, there are multiple ways to triangulate such a polygon with diagonals.\n\nVisualization:\nAssume that this is a rectangle:\n```\n __\n|  |\n|  |\n ¯¯\n```\nthen the possible triangulations are:\n```\n __     __\n|\\ |   | /|\n| \\|   |/ |\n ¯¯     ¯¯\n```\n\nIn this Kata, you will implement a function ```possible_triangulations(n)``` that returns the number of possible triangulations of a convex polygon with n vertices. If the number of vertices is less than 4, return 'Not a valid polygon'.\n\nExamples: For n=2, ```possible_triangulations(2)``` returns 2, as there are two ways to triangulate a rectangle. For n=5, ```possible_triangulations(5)``` returns 5\n\n<b> Notes/hints:</b>\n- The diagonals go from one vertex to any other and are not intersecting.\n- If you have problems solving this mathematical problem: this calculation is closely related to Catalan numbers.\n- As the solution will most likely be computationally complex, I limit the test cases to 1000 vertices.",
