    "description": "Two famous players are battling it out in the final of the codewars tennis world cup. Their names are represented by the characters ```A``` and ```B```.\n\nGiven a list of chars, ```l```, which follows the points scored in one set of a match,  where ```l.length >= 1```, calculate both player's score and return it in the appropriate notation. An instance of either player's character is a point for that player,  return your answer like this:\n\n```{A:[int games_won,int points_won],B:[int games_won,int points_won]}```\n\nWatch out for deuces and if the sequence ends on a unfinished deuce where no one has the advantage, set the points as ```40-40```, if a player has an advantage, use a one to indicate this in the points section, and use a zero for the opposing player.\n\nFor instance if a has an advantage: ```{\"A\":[0,1],\"B\":[0,0]}\n\nThe rules of tennis scoring:\n- First to 4 points wins the current game\n- Point 1 = 15, Point 2 = 30, Point 3 = 40\n\nExamples:\n\n```[A,A,B,A,B,A,B,B,A,B] -> {A:[1,15],B:[0,40]}```\n\n```[B,A,B,A,B,B,B,B,B,B,A] -> {A:[0,15],B:[2,0]}```\n\n",
