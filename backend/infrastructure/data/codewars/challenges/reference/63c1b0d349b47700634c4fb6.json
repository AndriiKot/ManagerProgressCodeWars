    "description": "Binary numbers can be used to store a bunch of data in a single `integer` column.\nFor example, if you have multiple ways to broadcast a notification and a user can say which channels they want to receive a notification through.\n\nLet's say your channels are `email`, `sms`, `app`, `web`, and `phone`.\nYou'd normally need 5 different boolean columns to track which channels the user wants. However, we can use binary to store all of these in a single field.\n\nKeeping the channels in order, using the first letter to identify them, you end up with `esawp`. Mapping that to binary, you can have `1` represent `true` and `0` represent `false`.\n\n```\nesawp\n10010\n```\n\nLooking at the above, we see a 1 for e and w, meaning the user wants `email` and `web` notifications, but no other ones.\nStarting from the right, each bit is 2x the previous bit starting with 1.\n\n```\n00001 == 1\n00010 == 2\n00100 == 4\n01000 == 8\n10000 == 16\netc...\n```\n\nWhen you have multiple bits, you just count them up:\n\n```\nesawp\n10010 == [16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0] == 18\n```\n\nUsing your newfound knowledge of binary, write a getter and setter for a user's notifications.\n\nThe input `channels` will be a base 10 number representing the starting notification preferences (18 == `email` and `web`)\n\nThe input `flag` will always be a power of 2, representing a single notification type value. (1 being phone, 2 == web, 16 == email, etc)\n\n`get` - return true/false based on whether the flag is present in the given channels.\n\n`add` - return a new base 10 number with the new flag added to the given channels list.\n\n`remove` - return a new base 10 number with the new flag removed from the given channels list.\n\nHint: Although you can solve these without, try to use bitwise operations in all three methods!\n",
