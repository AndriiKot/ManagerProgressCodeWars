    "description": "# Hangman\n\n[Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_%28game%29) is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters, within a certain number of guesses.\n\nEverytime the player misses a word, a part of the sketch is drawn:\n\n![Hangman](http://i.imgur.com/uHFv8ol.gif)\n\nIf the player finds the word before being hung he wins. He has 6 chances to miss before being hung.\n\n# Your task\n\nYou have to implement a function that receives a `word` and a list of `letters` as arguments, and has to return the result of the game:\n\n**input:**\n\n- `word`: the word the player had to guess.\n- `letters`: an array with the sequence of letters which the player guessed. may continue after player finds `word`. may contain repeated letters, which are to be counted as misses after the first occurrence.\n\n**output:**\n\n- `true` if the player managed to find the word; `false` if he was hung or didn't find the word before `letters` ran out.\n\n# Example\n\nInput: `hangman(\"codewars\",['a','e','i','o','u','c','d','p','r','k','l','j','h'])`\n\nExpected output: `false`",
