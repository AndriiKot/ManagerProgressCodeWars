    "description": "# Task\nWrite the function hamming_braille that calculates the [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between the [Braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille) representations of two strings and returns it as an integer. The Hamming distance measures the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.\n\nFor example, a (⠁) and b (⠃) have a distance of 1, whereas b (⠃) and j (⠚) have a distance of 3.\n\nThis function uses a simplified version of English Braille, including ligatures for commonly used words. For instance, `and` is represented as `⠯`. This ligature rule only applies to standalone words and does not affect combinations in other words (sand ≠ s+and).\n\nThe Hamming distance is valid only if the two strings' Braille lengths are equal. If they are not, the function returns -1.\n\nA lookup table for the simplified English Braille is provided in the dictionary `braille`.\n\nThe tests only consist of lowercase letters and numbers.",
