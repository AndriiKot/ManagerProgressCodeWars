    "description": "This year McCallisters are going to Miami for holidays.\nMinding their previous experience, for the lossless transfer to the airport, they decided to prepare the list of family members per vehicle, considering vehicle capacity.\n\nHelp McCallisters to split the list of family members into chunks of size *m* (number of seats per vehicle) where each item goes in order of appearance in initial list.\n\n**Example:**\n\nFor initial array: `['Kevin','Buzz','Megan','Linnie','Uncle Frank']`\n\nand vehicle capacity: `3`\n\nyour code must return: `[['Kevin','Buzz','Megan'],['Linnie','Uncle Frank']]`\n\n\n***p.s.***  bear in mind performance while developing your solution, McCallisters family expect new members soon and they don't want anybody left home alone\n\n***p.p.s*** also, beware, clumsy Pizza Guy has spilled the soda onto router, so entire family left without Internet and no external libraries are available\n\n\n\n\n\n",
