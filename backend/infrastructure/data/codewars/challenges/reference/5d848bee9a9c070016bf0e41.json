    "description": "This kata is designed to check your fundamentals like how to play with lists or arrays.\n\nHere you have to return the Summation of Squares & Cubes of the numbers which have been given as an input. The numbers can be positive as well as negative, it can be integers as well as floating point.Your final solution should be positive and it should be rounded off till 4 digits.\n\nFor rounding off use predefined function.\n\neg: \n```\n=>l which is the input is a list of numbers \n\nl=[1,2,3] \n\nso here the output will be \n\ns=1^2+2^2+3^2+1^3+2^3+3^3\ns=50\n\n```\nBest of luck !",
