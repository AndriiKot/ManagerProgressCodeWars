    "description": "### Task\n\nCreate a function `recaman_string(n)` that returns a string representation of the first `n` iterations of [Recamán's Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recam%C3%A1n%27s_sequence) using specific characters for a blocky visualization.\n\n#### Recamán's Sequence Overview:\n\nThe Recamán's Sequence is a mathematical sequence defined as follows:\n ```math\n a_n\n\\begin{cases}\n0, &\\text{  if  } n = 0 \\\\\na_{n−1} − n,&\\text{  if  } a_{n−1} − n > 0 \\text{  and not already in the sequence.} \\\\\na_{n−1} +n, &\\text{  otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n```\n#### Rules for the Blocky Visualization:\n\n- Characters: `[' ', '│', '─', '┌', '┐', '┘', '└', '┤', '├', '┼', '\\n']`\n- In the visualization numbers are spaced out linearly with one space in between them as `. . . .`\n- Arcs alternate between upward and downward, starting with an upward arc at iteration 1.\n- Arcs consist of 2 vertical lines (at terms `a_n` and `a_n+1`) and one horizontal line between them.\n- Arcs always start and end at the same height and are connected to the last arc.\n- The horizontal line should be as close as possible to everything previously drawn in that section:\n    - It should always go above/below everything previously drawn in that section.\n    - Overlapping vertical lines are allowed. Horizontal lines should never overlap.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```\nn = 0\n```\n```\nn = 1\n┌─┐\n```\n```\nn = 2\n┌─┐\n  └───┘\n```\n```\nn = 3\n┌─┐   ┌─────┐\n  └───┘\n```\n```\nn = 4\n┌─┐   ┌─────┐\n  └─┼─┘     │\n    └───────┘\n```\n```\nn = 5\n    ┌─────────┐\n┌─┐ │ ┌─────┐ │\n  └─┼─┘     │\n    └───────┘\n```\n```\nn = 6\n    ┌─────────┐\n┌─┐ │ ┌─────┐ │\n  └─┼─┘     │ └───────────┘\n    └───────┘\n```\n\n## Note\n\n1. Every line but the last line ends with a newline character `\\n`.\n2. No row should have trailing whitespaces.\n3. The length of your code must be under 4000 characters to avoid hardcoded solutions.\n4. The tests can go up to `n = 500`",
