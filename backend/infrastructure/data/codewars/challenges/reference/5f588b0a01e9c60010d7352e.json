    "description": "Disclaimer: <b>This kata is based on a previous one which you can find here i.e. Most frequently used words in a text (https://www.codewars.com/kata/51e056fe544cf36c410000fb)</b>. Hence, this only serves as a translation of that kata in primitive C programming language.\nTask:\nDesign a function named top_3_words to extract top 3 most-occurring words in a given string. The solution, when given a string, has to produce an array of strings, as shown below:\n\n      Format:\n      char** top_3_string(char* text);\n  \nRestrictions in this Kata:\n1. There would be no more than 150 unique words in each given string\n2. Each unique word has a length not more than 20 alphabets\n\nEnjoy this kata!",
