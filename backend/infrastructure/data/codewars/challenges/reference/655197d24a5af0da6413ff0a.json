    "description": "  You have disrupted Mr. Ozarka's class! You have to stay after school as a detention for what you have done. You have to write \"i am a kebab\" on the board repeatedly Bart Simpson style! Except, Mr. Ozarka wants you to occasionally write in **ALL CAPS**. This increases *quadratically* because he loves math. For example, if Mr. Ozarka wants you to write 9 times, the output would be: \n```\n[I AM A KEBOB, i am a kebab, i am a kebab, I AM A KEBOB, i am a kebab, i am a kebab, i am a kebab, i am a kebab, I AM A KEBOB\"]\n``` \nHe hopes you have learned your lesson!",
