    "description": "It's fizzbuzz time! What again? That enough, let's show your true skills by using some regex :D\n\n\nYou will be given a string of digits only.\n\nIf the integer formed by these digits is divisible by 3, it must be captured in the \"fizz\" group.\nif it's divisible by 5, it must be captured in a \"buzz\" group.\n\nHowever, if it is both divisible by 3 and 5, it would then be captured to the \"fizzbuzz\" group, only\nLastly, dont match any number not following any of the 3 rules.\n\n\n# Tests\n\nYour regex will be tested with positive numbers.\n\n- All the number below and 100 are tested\n- Random test will consits in 3 type of numbers:\n  - 50 small number  1 000 <= x <= 10 000\n  - 50 medium number  100 000 <= x <= 1 000 000\n  - 50 large number  1 000 000 000 <= x <=  1 000 000 000 000\n\n<hr>\n\n*The author of this regex is quackbarc, and allowed me to make a kata about it*\nGood Luck!\n",
