    "description": "#### **Task:**\n\nGiven 2 lines. Necessary:\n1. Exclude their intersection from the given lines, taking into account the number of characters and the order of their appearance in the string.\n2. In place of the excluded characters from the first line, insert the remaining characters from the second, as if replacing those that were deleted, 1 character per place.\n    - If there are more spaces in the first line than there are characters left in the second, then you do not need to put anything in these spaces, but if there are no more spaces, but there are characters left from the second line, you need to add them to the end of the first.\n3. Return the resulting string.\n\n___\n#### **Example:**\n\ncombination(**\"`abcde`\"**, **\"`bdz`\"**) => **\"`azce`\"**\n- *Remove from each line their intersections:* **\"`a` ~~`b`~~ `c` ~~`d`~~ `e`\"** *and* **\"~~`b`~~ ~~`d`~~ `z`\"**\n- *Fill the empty spaces of the first line with the remaining characters from the second line and eturn the resulting string:* **\"`azce`\"**\n\n**More examples in test tasks.**\n",
