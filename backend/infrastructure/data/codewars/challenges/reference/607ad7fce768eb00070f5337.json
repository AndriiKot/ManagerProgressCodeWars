    "description": "We are given a box, and we want to raise some bacteria in a box. Initially, the box is empty. Each morning, you can put any number of bacteria into the box. And each night, every bacterium in the box will split into two bacteria.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of bacteria you need to put into the box across those days so that you see exactly x bacteria someday?\n\nExample 1:\nx = 5\nOutput = 2\nWe can add one bacterium in the box in the first day morning and at the third morning there will be 4 bacteria in the box. Now we put one more resulting 5 in the box. We added 2 bacteria in the process so the answer is 2.\n\nExample 2:\nx = 8\nOutput = 1\nWe just have to add one bacterium on the first morning, and on the 4th morning there will be 8 total bacteria in the box.\n\nExample 3:\nx = 22\nOutput = 3\nWe add one bacterium on first day, then on third day,the total count is 4 and we add one more on the third day making the total count 5,then on fourth day total count is 10 we add one more making the total count 11,then on fifth day there will be 22 bacteria in the box.\n\n",
