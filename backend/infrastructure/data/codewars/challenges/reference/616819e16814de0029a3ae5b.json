    "description": "Thomas opened Vim on his computer, and now he is stuck in it! Help Thomas figure out how to __save the current file__ and __exit__ Vim!\n\n## Task\n\nVim is a text editor. Thomas' Vim is currently in \"Normal\" mode.\n\nYou are given a `Keyboard` object with the method `key_down` and `key_up`. Invoke the methods with the appropriate keys, so that you execute commands to save the current file and quit Vim.\n\nThe keys should be entered in string format:\n```python\nboard.key_down('a') # presses down the 'A' key\nboard.key_down('shift')  # presses down the 'shift' key\nboard.key_down('b') # presses 'b'; since 'shift' is already down, the input will be capital 'B'\nboard.key_up('a') # releases 'a' before pressing it again\nboard.key_up('shift') # re;eases the 'shift' key\nboard.key_down('a')\n```\n\nThe above code will enter `aBa` into Thomas' computer.\n\nGood luck!\n\n## Notes\n- Valid keys are `a` to `z`, `shift`, `enter` and `;`.\n- You must release a key before pressing it again, or Thomas will smash the key into his keyboard and break his computer! Similarly, you mustn't release a key that isn't pressed down.\n- All keys must be released at the end of the function!\n- For simplicity, all irrelevant commands and features are disabled.\n\n## Hints\n- Pressing `;` when `shift` is pressed will enter `:` into the computer.\n- Stuck? Check out [this Vim command guide](https://learnbyexample.gitbooks.io/vim-reference/content/Command_Line_mode.html).\n- Capitalization of commands matters! `:w` is different from `:W`.\n- Remember to press the `enter` key after entering commands ;)",
