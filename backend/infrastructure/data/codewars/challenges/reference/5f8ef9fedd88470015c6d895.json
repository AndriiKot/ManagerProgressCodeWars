    "description": "# The Microwave Problem\n\nMy microwave oven at home has this functionality where you can hit a \"+30\" button and it will add 30 seconds to the time you want to heat your food for. This has made me incredibly lazy and even if I want to heat something for 5min, I will just spam the \"+30\" button 10 times instead of thinking if there are less button presses that will give me the same result!\n\n#### What I need from you\nPlease write me a function that will return the shortest amount of button presses to get to the given time (As displayed on the screen).\n\n```csharp\nKata.MicrowaveLeastMoves(string time)\n``` \n```php\nmicrowaveLeastMoves($time)\n```\n```c\nmicrowave_least_moves(const char *time)\n```\n```python\nmicrowave_least_moves(time)\n```\n```javascript\nmicrowaveLeastMoves(time)\n```\n\n#### The rules of my Microwave are as follows:\n\n* For this problem, you may assume that the microwave oven timer always starts at `00:00`.\n\n* Buttons:\n  - Numbers 0-9 Which when pressed, will add that number to the microwave oven timer (Starting from the left). \n      - Examples:\n    \n      - If I press \"5\" then I press \"0\" twice, it will put `05:00` on the timer.\n    \n      - If I press \"3\" then I press \"0\" it will put `00:30` on the timer\n    \n  - +30 which adds 30 seconds to the current timer\n  - There is a \"Start\" button which you have to finally press before the microwave oven starts. Remember to press this!\n  \n* There is no need to validate input, it will always be valid.\n\n* Input may not always be what you expect. For example you can put in `00:70` and this is valid",
