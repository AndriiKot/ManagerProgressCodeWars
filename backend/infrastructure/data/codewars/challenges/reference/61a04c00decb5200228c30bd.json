    "description": "Bob has finally found a class that he's not bored in -- math. However, the classwork is a little too hard for him. He only knows basic arithmetic, and does not understand the algebra the teacher has put on the board. Bob needs your help!\n\nGiven a string expression of the form `\"n <operation> x = y\"`, where `operation` is an arithmetic operation (`+`,`-`,`*`,`/`), `x` and `y` are integers, and `n` is a lowercase latin character representing a variable, return a string in the form `\"n = <answer>\"` where `answer` is the solution to the equation as an integer. It is guaranteed that there will be an integer solution to every equation. \n\nExamples:\n```python3\nalgebra(\"a + 5 = 0\")  => \"a = -5\"\nalgebra(\"v - 15 = 7\") => \"v = 22\"\nalgebra(\"m * 8 = 88\") => \"m = 11\"\nalgebra(\"d / 12 = 3\") => \"d = 36\"\n```",
