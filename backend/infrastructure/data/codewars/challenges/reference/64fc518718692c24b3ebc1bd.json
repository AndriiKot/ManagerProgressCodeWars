    "description": "A rental manager enters costs for househeeting into sheet cell for every apartment individually. \n\nFor make further processing easy, costs are entered in a preformatted way.\nWhen data will be read to a javascript program, it will be a string.\n\nSo manager enters data like:\n\n```{\"apartNumber\": cost, \"apartNumber\": cost, ...}```\n\nor, as example:\n\n```{\"1\": 100, \"2\": 100, \"3\": 150}```\n\nAs it will be convert to a string, while reading, input for the function will be a string:\n\n```'{\"1\": 100, \"2\": 100, \"3\": 150}'```\n\nManager is not so much accurate, so it can put some spaces accidentally in any place. Hopefully, not inside numbers.\n\nA programmer doesn't remember, what will be the data for an empty cell after reading. Probably, it will be undefined or an empty string. And an empty cell can be a case. Some monthes heating is off. \n\nWrite a function, which will convert this string pseudo-object input to a real object.",
