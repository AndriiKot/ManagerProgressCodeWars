    "description": "say you have a velocity of an object, and you have friction you would want to apply to it, the obvious solution would be to decrease or increase the velocity by the friction, until it reaches 0. but what if, when you decrease the velocity, it goes over, and becomes negative?\n\nmake a program that makes the velocity closer to 0, by incrementing or decreasing it by the friction, but make sure that the program only decreases it by an amount that will never result in a change of sign. you will be given negative and positive numbers, it shouldn't matter if the friction is negative, the friction should always make it closer to zero.
