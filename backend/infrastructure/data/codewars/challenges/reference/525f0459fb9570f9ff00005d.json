    "description": "Your friend saw the great work you did with keeping your user-names at bay in\n\nhttp://www.codewars.com/dojo/katas/525d9b1a037b7a9da7000905\n\nnow he'd like you to do (nearly) the same thing for his website, but as\nalways, the devil is in the details.\n\nHe has troubles with users *ending or starting* in a \".\", and his user-array\nis a flat array of user-email-pairs, like so:\n\n```\n[ \"foo\", \"foo@bar.com\", \"bar\", \"bar@foo.com\", \".foo\", \"food@bar.com\" ]\n```\n\nHe is only interested in e-mailing the users and ask them to sign up again,\nso no need to keep the user-name, only e-mail addresses for the user-names\nthat start or end with a \".\" should be returned. For the above array, the\ncorrect return-array would be\n\n```\n[ \"food@bar.com\" ]\n```\n\nYou *have to use* the filter-method of Javascript, which returns each element of \nthe array for which the filter-method returns true. The second argument gives\nthe index you're looking at and the third argument is the array itself:\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter\n",
