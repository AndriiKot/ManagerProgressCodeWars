    "description": "Dora and her best friend Boots are off on an adventure in India!\n\nAfter a long journey riding on camels through the desert, the gang goes to a restaurant and orders a drink called special lassi (you can read about this cultural treat that has dated back since 2000 BCE).\n\nUnfortunately, Dora suspected that Swiper the fox had followed them to the restaurant and will likely take their drinks at the first opportunity. \n\nDora needs your help to stop Swiper from swiping the lassis!\n\nYou will be given an array of letters. Dora and Boots are represented as 'x', while Swiper, who can dress in different disguises, is represented as any case-sensitive vowel (discluding y). \n\nIf Swiper is next to Dora, yell \"Swiper, no swiping!\". If Swiper is here, but not next to Dora, cry out \"Keep your eyes peel Dora!\". If Swiper is not present at the restaurant, let Dora know there is nothing to worry about.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\n['n', 't', 'x', 'A', 'p', 's'] => \"Swiper, no swiping!\"\n\n['r', 't', 'e', 'q', 'x', 'W'] => \"Keep your eyes peel Dora!\"\n\n['n',' t', 'y', 'j', 'x', 'W'] => \"You're safe Dora!\"\n```\n\nIf you enjoyed this kata, please rate it :). If you have any constructive feedbacks on the elements that weren't to your satisfaction, leave a suggestion!\n",
