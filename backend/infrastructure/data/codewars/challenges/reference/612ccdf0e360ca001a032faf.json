    "description": "# Story\nToday is Lucas' Birthday. Everyone is having fun, and all is going well, until his Birthday String was finally delivered to their doorstep, at 2pm. \n\nHis Birthday String sucked, because Birthday String shouldn't have any Double Letters in it. As he was dissapointed at his Birthday String, his parents got an idea! Birthday Strings could also be split into pieces; just in case these types of situations happen. However, these cannot be concatenated together since it easily gets ruined. \n\nOf course, his parents still wanted Lucas to have a long and great Birthday String as it means how prosperous your CS career would be -- similar to Chinese Birthday Noodles. \n\nNow, as a parent of Lucas, it is your job to find the longest part of the Birthday String that doesn't have a double letter. \n\nIf unclear, double letters mean something like \"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\", \"dd\",..., \"yy\", \"zz\". \n<hr>\n\n# Input\n```2 < len(birthday_string) < 1000```<br>\n```birthday_string only has lower case english letters```<br>\n```Assume birthday_string can be a perfectly fine birthday_string -- not always has double letters -- :)```\n\n<br>\n\n# Output\nThe longest continuous substring from `birthday_string`\n\n<hr>\n\nOn your bithday, I hope for a long yet perfect Birthday String for you!",
