    "description": "__In this kata, your objective - if choose to accept - is to write the function `chessStats` that takes two parameters `(player, games)` and returns different scores of the chess player.__\n\n## Basic info on chess:\n\n1. A chess game is played between two players.\n2. Result of a game will either be 'Win', 'Lose', or 'Draw'.\n\n[Chess - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess)\n\n---\n__Now to the coding:__\n## Parameters:\n1. `player` integer parameter indicates whose stats you are going to return (_`1` = player 1 and `2` = player 2_).\n2. `games` array holds the result of the games played between player 1 and player 2. Each item represents a single game played between player 1 and player 2 (_e.g:_ `['1-0', '0.5-0.5', '0-1', '1-0']`). `1` means win, `0.5` is draw, and `0` indicates the player lost the game. So `'1-0'` means player 1 won and player 2, obviously, lost that game.\n\n## Your Task:\n__Return an `array` holding 4 _integer_ values & a _string_ value.__  \n\n   `[totalGamesPlayed, gamesWon, losePercentage, longestWinStreak, matchStatus]`  \n   \n\n    `totalGamesPlayed` = Total number of games played.  \n    `gamesWon` = Number of games won by the player.  \n    `losePercentage` = Games lost by the player in percentage.  \n    `longestWinStreak` = Longest winning streak by the player.  \n    `matchStatus` = Whether the player `\"Won\"`, `\"Lost\"` or `\"Drew\"` the match series. (See Notes)\n\n## Notes:\n\n1. Assume all the inputs are valid.\n2. Floor the value for `losePercentage`.\n3. To elaborate `matchStatus`: It is determined by comparing the scores of both players at the end of match series. If the player scores more than their opponent, they `\"Won\"`, or if the score is lower then they `\"Lost\"`, or if the scores are equal then it's `\"Drew\"`\n\n\n---\n\n## Examples:\n    chessStats(1, ['0.5-0.5', '1-0', '1-0', '0-1', '0.5-0.5', '1-0'])  // returns [6, 3, 16, 2, \"Won\"]  \n    \n    chessStats(2, ['0.5-0.5', '1-0', '1-0', '0-1', '0.5-0.5', '1-0'])  // returns [6, 1, 50, 1, \"Lost\"]",
