    "description": "Your math teacher keeps giving you long lists of numbers `(meaning integers AND floats)`, and expects you to find the `Maximum (max)`, `Minimum (min)`, `Median (med)` and `Mean`!\n\nHow are you supposed to do that? That's way too much work!\n\nLike any good programmer, you only like to do things once, so create function `list_mix()` to do it for you!\n\n`list_mix()` will take an input in the form of a list of numbers, and output the `max, min, med, and mean` in that order!\n\n- `max` is the biggest number in the list.\n- `min` is the smallest number in the list.\n- `med` is the number in the middle when the list is sorted.\n- `mean` is all the elements of the list summed together divided by the length of the list, or the average.\n\n`Note:` The list will only have valid types, so no need for error checking, and if the list has an even amount of numbers, return the average of the two numbers in the middle for the median.\n\n`All floats should be rounded to two decimal places.`\n\nHere are a few examples to help clarify:\n\n```python\nlist_mix([1, 5, 4, 3, 2]) == [5, 1, 3, 3] #max, min, med, mean\nlist_mix([1]) == [1, 1, 1, 1]\nlist_mix([-12, 2, 1.2, 20]) == [20, -12, 1.6, 2.8]\n```",
