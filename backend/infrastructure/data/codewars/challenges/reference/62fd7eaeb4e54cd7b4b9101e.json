    "description": "A laboratory recives a delivery of samples for a specific raw material to test. Based on previous test history, the material is known to be reliable and as such not every sample is tested. A composite sample, comprised of up to 10 samples is made and tested.\n\nWrite a function that takes a number of samples and returns an array which is sorted in descending order of the number of samples in each composite given the following constraints;\n\nA composite cannot have more than 10 samples,\n\nThe composites must be evenly distributed e.g. the most equally representative composites for 22 samples would be [8, 7, 7] rather than [10, 10, 2]\n\nThe array length must be the minimum number of composite samples required (No unnecessary testing in this lab).  \n",
