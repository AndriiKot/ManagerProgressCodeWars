    "description": "# Introduction\nYou want do design a card game with ```n``` cards where on each card are ```s``` different symbols. Each card ```c_i``` always has one symbol in common with any other card ```c_j``` with ```i != j```. \n\nIt wouldn't be fun if the common symbol between any two cards is always the same.\n\n# Question\nYou wonder how many different symbols you have to put on one card, given that the game shall have ```n``` cards (with ```n > 3```). Find the _minimal_ number of symbols to use so that any 2 cards have _exactly one_ symbol in common. \n\n## Example\nIn case of ```n = 7``` cards, you would need 3 symbols on each card - consider the following matrix of cards and symbols:\n```\n              symbol\n        1  2  3  4  5  6  7 \n\t 1  X  X  -  -  X  -  -\n\t 2  X  -  X  -  -  X  -\n\t 3  X  -  -  X  -  -  X\ncard 4  -  -  X  X  X  -  -\n\t 5  -  -  -  -  X  X  X\n\t 6  -  X  X  -  -  -  X\n\t 7  -  X  -  X  -  X  -\n```\nNotice that any card only has one symbol in common with any other card.\n\n## Bad example:\nThe general case of the trivial solution shall not be valid (example with ```n = 4``` and ```s = 2```):\n```\n      symbol\n     1  2  3  4  5\nc_1  X  X  -  -  -\nc_2  X  -  X  -  -\nc_3  X  -  -  X  -\nc_4  X  -  -  -  X\n```\nThis solution is prohibited, as the common symbol between any pair of cards is always the same.\n\n# Task\nWrite a function \n```go \nCntDiffSymbols(n int)\n``` \n```javascript \ncntDiffSymbols(n)\n``` \n```typescript \ncntDiffSymbols(n: number)\n``` \n```python \ncnt_diff_symbols(n)\n``` \nthat returns the count of different symbols needed for ```n``` cards.",
