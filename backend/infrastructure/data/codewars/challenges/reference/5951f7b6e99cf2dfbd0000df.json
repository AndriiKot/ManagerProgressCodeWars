    "description": "In this assignment, you will need to check if one object is _partially equal_ to another.\n\nAn object `o1` is _partially equal_ to another object `o2` if it has a subset of keys from `o2`, and all of them are equal. \n\nFor example, the object `{type: 'dog', age: 5}` is not partially equal to `{type: 'dog', name:'kitty', age: 6}`, because it has a different `age`. It is, however, partially equal to `{type: 'dog', age:5, height:'40cm'}`.\n\nNote that every object can have other objects like `{type:'cat', age:3, favoriteFood: { fish: true, bacon: false}}` and the nested objects should be partially equal as well. \n\nFor simplicity, an object item can be a string, boolean, number or object.",
