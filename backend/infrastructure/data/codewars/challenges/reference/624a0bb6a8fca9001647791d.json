    "description": "# Task\n\nIn this task, you need to implement a program that converts text into jsfuck.\n\nJSFuck is an esoteric subset of JavaScript, where code is written using only six characters: `[, ], (, ), ! and +`. This language is somewhat similar to Brainfuck.\n\nYou need to implement support for the following characters: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789 `.\n\nAt the input to the program, you will receive a string containing a set of only valid characters. You need to output a string that is equivalent to the input string and also contains only valid JSFuck characters.\n\nYou can read more about this language [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSFuck).\n\n# Examples\n\n```\n  let input = \"a\";\n  \n  // You should end up with something like this.\n  convertToJSFuck(input); => \"(![]+[])[+!![]]\"\n```\n\n```\n  let input = \"123\";\n  \n  // You should end up with something like this.\n  convertToJSFuck(input); => \"(+!![]+[])+(+!![]+!![]+[])+(+!![]+!![]+!![]+[])\"\n```",
