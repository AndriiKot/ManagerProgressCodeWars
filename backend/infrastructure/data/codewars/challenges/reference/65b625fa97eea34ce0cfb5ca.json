    "description": "This kata was inspired by a game described by Edsger W Dijkstra, in his video lecture \"Reasoning About Programs\".\n\nImagine you are playing a game. \n\nYou are given a supply of black and white pebbles, and an urn. An amount of black and white pebbles is placed into the urn. \n\nThe player randomly draws two pebbles from the urn. \n\nIf the two pebbles are different colours, a white pebble is placed back in the urn. \n\nIf both pebbles are black, one black pebble is placed back in the urn. \n\nIf both pebbles are white, one black pebble is added to the urn.\n\nThe game continues until there are less than two pebbles in the urn to draw from. There will always be enough extra pebbles outside the urn to continue playing. \n\nBecause each turn involves returning a pebble, there game will always end with a single pebble in the urn. But what will its colour be?\n\nWrite a method that takes a quantity of black and white pebbles then returns \"black\" or \"white\" depending on the final pebble colour. You will always be provided at least one pebble of each colour.\n\n\n",
