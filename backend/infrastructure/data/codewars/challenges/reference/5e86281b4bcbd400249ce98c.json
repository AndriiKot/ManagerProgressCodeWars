    "description": "You're a junior network engineer and you might have accidentaly deleted all PTR records in the DNS database, oops... \n\nYou want to quickly recreate all PTR records from the existing IPv4 addresses in your database, so you write a function that returns the PTRDNAME of a given IPv4 address. If the input is not a valid IPv4 address, you want the function to return an error string: ```ERROR: INVALID IPV4 ADDRESS```\n\nConsider valid IPv4 addresses to be any address in the range ```0.0.0.0``` to ```255.255.255.255```. As with any IPv4 address, leading zero's should be omitted. \n\nA PTRDNAME is used for 'reverse lookup' of hostnames by an IP address. PTRDNAMES are made up of the 4 bytes in an IPv4 address in reverse order and the string \".IN-ADDR.ARPA.\". \nThe output of your function should be PTRDNAMEs as a string and should include \".IN-ADDR.ARPA.\" at the end.  \n\nExamples:\n```\ntoPTR \"192.168.0.10\" Should Output \"10.0.168.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA.\"\ntoPTR \"192.168.0.010\" Should Output \"ERROR: INVALID IPV4 ADDRESS\"\ntoPTR \"192.0.10\" Should Output \"ERROR: INVALID IPV4 ADDRESS\"\n```\n",
