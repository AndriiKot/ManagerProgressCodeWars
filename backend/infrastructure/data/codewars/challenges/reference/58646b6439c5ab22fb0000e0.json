    "description": "**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students**\n\n\nWrite a function named euclidGcd() that takes two number arguments, and gets the greatest common denominator of both numbers, using euclids algorithm\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number. For example, 21 is the GCD of 252 and 105 (252 = 21 × 12 and 105 = 21 × 5), and the same number 21 is also the GCD of 105 and 147 = 252 − 105. Since this replacement reduces the larger of the two numbers, repeating this process gives successively smaller pairs of numbers until the two numbers become equal. When that occurs, they are the GCD of the original two numbers.\n\n```javascript\neuclidGcd(7,24) // => 1\neuclidGcd(710,310) // => 10\neuclidGcd(-100,-90) // => -10;\n```\n\nNote:  \nNegative numbers are valid inputs",
