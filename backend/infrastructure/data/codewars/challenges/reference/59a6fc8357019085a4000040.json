    "description": "There are many ways to clear the catacombs, er um, I mean methods to modify your strings! Let's say you've got a string called `catacombs`, and it's full of spiders and bats, like so:\n\n```ruby\ncatacombs = \"spiders and bats!\"\n```\n\nWhile you may be tempted to call `catacombs.overtune` to clear the catacombs, unfortunately that's an undefined method in Ruby!\n\nYour job is to find and use the method on the `catacombs` so that it's cleared and returns an empty string. Good luck!\n\n```ruby\nclearify(\"spiders and bats!\") # => \"\"\ncatacombs # => \"\"\n```",
