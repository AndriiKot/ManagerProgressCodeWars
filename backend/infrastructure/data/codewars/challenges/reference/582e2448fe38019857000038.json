    "description": "I have decided to create series of Katas based on real examples from power/utilities (and especially trading) area. I think that it may be refreshing to try something more practical. First we begin with something simple.\n\n<h1>Task</h1>\nYour task is to calculate how many hours are valid between two given dates for specified products.\n\nProducts are following:\n<ul>\n  <li>Base load</li> - all days, all hours\n  <li>Peak load</li> - only working days, 8:00-20:00\n  <li>Off-Peak load</li> - during working days 00:00 - 08:00 and 20:00 - 00:00, during weekends all hours\n</ul>\n\nInput will have form of two dates in [C++: dd.mm.yyyy, Java: dd.MM.yyyy) format and product as one of strings \"BASE\", \"PEAK\", \"OFFPEAK\".\n\n\n<h1>Example</h1>\nFirst example is to calculate number of valid hours between 1.11.2016 (Tuesday) and 7.11.2016 (Monday) for base load, which should return 168 <i>```number of days * number of hours```</i>\n\nFor same dates, but Peak load product, function should return <i>```{number of working days} * 12```</i>, which is in this case 5 * 12 = 60.\n\nFor offpeak product, it is <i>```{number of working days} * 12 + {number of weekend days} * 24```</i> = 5 * 12 + 2 * 24 = 108.\n\nDon't forget to take leap years into account! :-) Holidays are irrelevant (will be part 2), and bonus for you is, when you will solve it without using loops",
