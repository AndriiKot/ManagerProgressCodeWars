    "description": "Ethernet Format to Token-Ring Format converter\n----------------------------------------------\n\nDuring data link phase in a computer network, mac address exchange is performed by sending mac addresses in binary format.\n\nBy default, most network mac exchanges are performed in their canonical 802 (IEEE) format.\n\n``Note: Canonical form means that the least significant bit in the MAC is the first bit that maps to binary data in memory - e.g: In a LAN, the least significant bit is set to the corresponding first bit of the initial byte part in the binary form of data to be transferred -``\n\nIn token ring-based networks, when circulating mac addresses the bit ordering is ***reversed*** and every first bit of bytes in memory during transfer are set to the most significant (or leftmost memory bits).This causes a left-to-right bit transfer outlined in the example below:\n\n\n                In memory,      12       34       56       78       9A       BC\n                canonical:   00010010 00110100 01010110 01111000 10011010 10111100\n\n                1st bit appearing on LAN (group address indicator)\n                |\n                On LAN:      01001000 00101100 01101010 00011110 01011001 00111101\n\n                In memory,\n                MSB format:  01001000 00101100 01101010 00011110 01011001 00111101\n                                48       2C       6A       1E       59       3D\n\nYou are required to prepare the function **revOrderMark** that can convert a mac address from canonical-format to token-ring format and vice-versa.\n The output of the function should be a mac address in IEEE format. In a case where an error input is found, a mac of  00-00-00-00-00-00 should be returned.\n\nError input types are descibed below:\n\n                Alphanum tokens:   \"ijsj38j2j4920xjc93202\"\n                Numeric input:     \"77553516586165\"\n                Non-mac addresses: \"90-B3-IK-23-44-7C\" Or \"90-BB-7829-900-A7-09\" \n\n Output sample shown below:\n\n                 11-22-33-44-55-66\n\n&nbsp;\n<br />\n## Relevant websites:\n* [Mac Address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address)\n* [IEEE Standards for MAC](https://standards.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-standards/standards/web/documents/tutorials/eui.pdf)",
