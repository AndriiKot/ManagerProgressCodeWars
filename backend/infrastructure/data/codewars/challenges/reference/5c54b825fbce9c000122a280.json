    "description": "Implement a function named ``winner(results)`` which takes the\nmatch results of each team in the league, and returns who won the championship (got the most points).\n\nA team wins if it's score in a game is higher than the other team and is awarded 3 points.\n\nA team loses if it's score in a game is lower than the other team and is awarded 0 points.\n\nThe game ties if both teams score is the same and each team will be awarded 1 point.\n\nExample Input:\n```\n{\n  teamA: [\"1:0\", \"3:3\"],\n  teamB: [\"0:1\", \"3:1\"],\n  teamC: [\"3:3\", \"1:3\"]\n}\n```\n\nOutput would be: 'teamA'. Since teamA got 4 points, while teamB got 3 points, and teamC got 1 point.\n\nNo 2 teams wlll have the same number of points at the end of the league. There will be no empty inputs.",
