    "description": "**I will explain this problem with an example:**\n\nWhat is the largest value of *n* such that 5^n divides the number (2019! - 2018! + 2017!) ? \n\nAfter seeing a problem like this on a competition test, I thought it would be a very good coding problem, which is why it is on Codewars now.\n\n# Your task:\nTake 3 numbers, ```n1```, ```n2```, and ```n3```, which will be the numbers replacing the 2019, 2018, and 2017 in the example problem, and one more number, ```p```, which will be the base of the exponent (replacing the 5 in the example problem). A number, let's call it ```n```, will be returned. Your task will be to find this:\n\n**What is the largest value of *n* such that p^n divides the number (n1! - n2! + n3!) ?**\n\nNote: Each of ```n1```, ```n2```, and ```n3``` will go up to 5000. ```p``` will go up to 15. There are 200 random test cases.\n\nGood luck!\n\nP.S.: After finding my solution wasn't efficient enough and didn't work well, I had to change the complete solution, which now works much better. I didn't write it- BIG **BIG** thanks to Voile!",
