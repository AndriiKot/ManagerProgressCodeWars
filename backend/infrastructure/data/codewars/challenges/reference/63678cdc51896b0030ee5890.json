    "description": "Create a function `binaryPalindrome` that receives an integer number `N` (where `N` > 0) and returns the N-th *binary palindrome* (starting from 1).\n\nA *binary palindrome* is a decimal number which its binary representation is a palindrome (the binary digits in the reverse order are the same of the original binary digits).\n\nExamples of the first 10 decimal numbers that are binary palindrome numbers:\n* 1st = 1 (binary = 1)\n* 2nd = 3 (binary = 11)\n* 3rd = 5 (binary = 101)\n* 4th = 7 (binary = 111)\n* 5th = 9 (binary = 1001)\n* 6th = 15 (binary = 1111)\n* 7th = 17 (binary = 10001)\n* 8th = 21 (binary = 10101)\n* 9th = 27 (binary = 11011)\n* 10th = 31 (binary = 11111)\n\nYour function should be able to handle values from 1 to 1000000.",
