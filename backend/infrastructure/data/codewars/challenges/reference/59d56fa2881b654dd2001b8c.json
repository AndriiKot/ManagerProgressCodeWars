    "description": "## Beta Kata\nThank you for trying this beta kata. Once you've completed it, please rate how satisfied you are with this kata and rank it. Katas can only get out of beta if they are rated very satisfied. If you don't give it a very satisfied rating, share your reasons for keeping the kata in beta in a comment as a suggestion or issue. Once the suggestion or issue is resolved, please re-rate as very satisfied. Note that a kata that is _too easy_ or _too hard_ should not be given a lower satisfaction rating, but given a kyu ranking that matches the kata's difficulty.\n\n## Prime and Composite Characters\nIf we number the characters in a string, **starting with 1**, the prime characters of a string are those characters that are prime numbered, and the compose characters are the characters that are composite numbered\n\n```\n 123456\n\"hello \"\n\n# prime characters\n 235\n\"elo\"\n\n# composite characters\n 46\n\"l \"\n\n# remember, 1 is neither prime nor composite\n```\n\n## Your task\nWrite the function `cpchars(s)` that takes `s` a string (in R, a character vector of length 1), and returns a re-ordered string, with the composite characters first, then the prime characters (with no separating character).\n\n## Examples:\n```r\ncpchars(\"Hello world!\") \n[1] \"l orl!elowd\"\n\ncpchars(\"a\")\n[1] \"\"\n\ncpchars(\" 23 5 7   \")\n[1] \"     2357\"\n```",
