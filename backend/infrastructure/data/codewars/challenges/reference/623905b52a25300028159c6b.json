    "description": "You are a developer at The Company.\n\nPeople log in at The Company using PIN codes.\n\nSomeone in management has heard that PIN codes like \"1234\" and \"5555\" are not very safe, so they decided to tighten requirements for PINs. These are the rules they came up with:\n\n- Only digits allowed.\n- Minimum 4 characters.\n- The whole PIN cannot be a repetition of the same digit.\n- The whole PIN cannot consist of consecutive digits in the same direction.\n- A 9 followed by a 0 is considered consecutive.\n- A 0 followed by a 9 is considered consecutive.\n\nAs a trusted capable employee, you are now tasked with implementing a checker for new PINs.",
