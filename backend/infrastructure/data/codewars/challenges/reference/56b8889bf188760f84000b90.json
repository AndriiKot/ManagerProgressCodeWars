    "description": "We need a function ```find_next_pow()``` that may receive the following arguments:\n\n- ```val```, a positive integer value\n\n- ```pow_```, the value of an exponent that defines the function power()\n\n- ```am_factors```, the required amount of the smallest factors of ```val```, not including ```1``` (and ```val``` itself), that should have the perfect powers, too\n\n- ```k```, the wanted amount of the smallest perfect pow_ powers but higher than ```val```, that fulfill the above requirement.\n\nThe function will output a sorted list of length equals to ```k```, with the found values.\nSo, the order of arguments in the function and the output will be:\n```python\nfind_next_pow(val, pow_, am_factors, k) == [next_pow1, next_pow2, ...., next_powk] # val < next_pow1 < next_pow2 < ..... < next_powk\n```\n\nLet's see some examples:\n```python\nval = 1218\npow_ = 2\nam_factors = 4\nk = 3\nfind_next_pow(val, pow_, am_factors, k) == [1764, 7056, 15876]\n```\nExplanation:\n```\nfactors of 1218: 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 29, 42, 58, 87, 174, 203, 406, 609\n\nam_factors = 4 # So, we need the first 4 factors of 1218.\ncom_factors = [2, 3, 6 ,7]\n\nThe result, [1764, 7056, 15876], has three elements because k =3\n\nThe three terms are perfect squares as pow_ = 2.\n\nAll of them have [2, 3, 6, 7] as factors\n\nAnd 1218 < 1764 < 7056 < 15876.\n\nThese three perfect squares are the smallest posible perfect 2-powers (perfect square) higher than val = 1218, that have 2, 3, 6 and 7 as factors, the first four factors of 1218.\n```\n\nSpecial cases:\n\nIf ```val``` is a prime number, the function will return ```val is a prime number. No results```\n```python\nval = 997\npow_ = 3\nam_factors = 5\nk = 6\nfind_next_pow(val, pow_, am_factors, k) == \"val is a prime number. No results.\"\n```\n\nIf ```val``` is not a prime number but the number of factors is less than ```am_factors```, ```factors of val < am_factors)```, the function will return ```Not enough factors of the given value. No results.```\n```python\nval = 1994\npow_ = 2\nam_factors = 4\nk = 3\nfind_next_pow(val, pow_, am_factors, k) == \"Not enough factors of the given value. No results.\"\n```\nAssumptions: ```pow_```, ```am_factors``` and ```k``` will be always higher than ```1```.\n\n(Hint: See the prime factorization that a n-perfect power should have)\nHappy coding!!\n",
