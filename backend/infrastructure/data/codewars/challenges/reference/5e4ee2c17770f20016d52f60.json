    "description": "Description\n-----------\nThe company Evaluators evaluates products' quality in chunks of 9 products. The row of a product in a chunk is expressed by a single lowercase letter from \\[a-i] and the final evaluation is hierarchical and expressed by an integer in range \\[1-9]. The final output of the evaluation process is a string consisting of 9 succesive structures of <product + evaluation>. The issue occuring there was that nor products were evaluated by the order they inserted the chunk neither the evaluation has a related order. The challenge here is to modify the provided string such as your output to be a sorted string by the evaluation of the products.\n\nexample 1\n---------\n- s = 'a3h9c4i1d2e7f8g6b5'  # input\n- sortByNum(s)\n- 'i1d2a3c4b5g6e7f8h9'  # output\n\nexample 2\n---------\n- s = 'b9i5a8f3d7h4e6c2g1'  # input\n- sortByNum(s)\n- 'g1c2f3h4i5e6d7a8b9'  # output\n\nEvery input will always contain 9 structures. Products will always be letters from a to i and all evaluations will always integers from 1 to 9. All bounds inclusive.",
