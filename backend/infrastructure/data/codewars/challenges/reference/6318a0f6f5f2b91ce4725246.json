    "description": "You need to find the solution.s of a 2nd degree equation entered as a string\n\nAll these strings are allowed :\n- \"x2-3x+2=0\"\n-  \"x2^2 - 3.0*x2+ 2 = 0\"\n-  \"a**2 -3a +2=0\"\n\n- spaces, power (^, **), operator * are allowed but not mandatory \n- the three parameters a,b,c from \"ax2 + bx + c = 0\" will always be present even if they are equals to 0 \n- equation is always witten in power decreasing order \n- variables (a, x, x2, ...) begins with an alphabetic value and are composed with 1 to 5 alphanumeric values such as a21BC\n\nFunction solve(\"...\") will return :\n- a list ```[s1,s2]``` with the two solutions sorted in ascending order\n- a list ```[s]``` for a unique solution\n- None if there is no solution\n- \"R\" if there is an infinity of solutions\n\n- solutions are 5 digits precision",
