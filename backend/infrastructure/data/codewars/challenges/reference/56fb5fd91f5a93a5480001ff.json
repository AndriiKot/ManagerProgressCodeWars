    "description": "You are the host of a game show that only allows people whose height in centimeters is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that is the result of a single whole number being multiplied by itself.\n\nFor example, a person who is 169 cm (13 * 13) tall would be able to get in, but a person who is 173 cm tall would not.\n\nYou can assume that all given heights will be whole, and positive. All true outputs should evaluate to be whole numbers.",
