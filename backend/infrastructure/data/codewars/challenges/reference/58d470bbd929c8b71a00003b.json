    "description": "Please solve this puzzle, and fill your answer in the variable <code>my\\_answer</code>. \n\nIn this puzzle AT \\* A = CAT, a same letter represents a same digit, while different letters must represent different digits. \n\nSince C and A appear at the beginning of numbers, either cannot be zero. \n\nFor example, if one guesses A = 3, T = 7, the answer will be wrong in that\n37 \\* 3 = 111, but the product CAT is expected to be something like X37 (where X is not 0, 1, 3, or 7). \n\nYou can do it by pencil and paper. \n\nYou can also do it using programming language. \n\nSimple codes are possible to complete the kata because the complexity is trivial. Why not loop? \n\nMore interesting algorithms are happily welcome:-)\n\n## On results\n\nA partial solution as a string will pass. Please __have one space__ at both sides of '*' and '=', and keep no trailing spaces at the end. Since we are talking about arithmetics, we use '=' instead of '=='. \n\nFor example: (this answer is incorrect) <code>'37 \\* 3 = 111'</code>\n\nFull solutions are appreciated. Please return full solutions as a set, or a list, or a tuple, of strings formatted in the way above. Do not worry if your full solution is not complete or contains duplicates; they are also accepted. However, if a wrong entry is included, the whole full solution will be rejected. \n\n## On tests\n\nIf any entry of your solution pass ONE item in the check-list, there is a 'test passed' message; but I would not tell you what it is.
