    "description": "Julia read a book about encrypting messages and now she wants to communicate with her friend Mary only by encrypted messages, using their own encrypting system.\n\n\nJulia knows that each character is represented in the computer's memory by 8 bits in which the base 2 version of the ASCII code of the character is stored. To encrypt a character, Julia uses a square matrix that has 8 lines ( numbered from 0 to 7, top to bottom ) and 8 columns ( numbered from 0 to 7, left to right ). On the first line of the matrix Julia writes the 8 bits representing the base 2 version of the ASCII code of the character. On each of the following 7 lines of the matrix Julia writes the circular permutation one position to left of the previous line. She then sorts the lines of the matrix lexicographically and she defines the encrypted version of the character as being the sequence of bits represented by the last column of the matrix, top to bottom followed by the index of the line that contains the original base 2 representation of the character. If there are 2 or more such lines, you will use the index of the first one.\nTo encrypt a message, Julia writes the encrypted versions of the characters of the message one after the other.\nMary knows the way Julia encrypts messages and so she knows how to decrypt them.\n\n\nYour task\n1. Write a function named encrypt that takes as argument a string and returns another string representing the encrypted version of the original string.\n2. Write a function named decrypt that takes as argument an encrypted string and returns the decrypted string.\n\n\nRestrictions\n\nThe length of the decrypted message is greater than 0 and smaller or equal to 100\nThe characters from the message have ASCII codes from 33 to 126",
