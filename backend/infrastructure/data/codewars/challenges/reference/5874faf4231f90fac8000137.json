    "description": "So here we are, we've done 4 tests of varying difficulties up till now and here we have the final one where we'll need everything. Using the rows, columns and blocks and having multiple uncertainties.\n\nThe puzzles will be given as multi-dimensional arrays of integers and must be returned completed in the same format.\n\nEmpty cells are represented as 0's and there won't be any unsolvable problems or nil values\n\nFor more on the rules; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku\n\nHappy coding :D",
