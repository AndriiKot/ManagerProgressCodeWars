    "description": "### Story\nCOVID-19 is spreading in your country and you are wondering wheather it will ever end or not? Good thing is that you have all the data to calculate the number of days it will take to end! \n\n### Task\nCreate a function that takes the number of daily average recovered cases **recovers**, daily average **new_cases**, current **active_cases**, and returns the number of days it will take to reach zero cases. If recovery rate is less than the new_cases, you have to return `\"It will never end!\"`\n\n### Examples\n\nend_corona(4000, 2000, 76000) => 38\n\nend_corona(4000, 2000, 77000) => 39\n\nend_corona(3000, 2000, 50699) => 51\n\nend_corona(30000, 25000, 390205) => 79\n\nend_corona(2100, 2200, 15300) => \"It will never end!\"\n\n**Be conservative and round up the number of days needed. Beware of large numbers :)**",
