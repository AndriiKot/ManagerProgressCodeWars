    "description": "Dave wants to code a graphic representation of an analog clock. He has already written the code to obtain the current time and this will be provided to you. You will also be provided with the radius of the clock that he wants to draw. \n\nYou will be provided with an object such as this:\n\n<b>{time:{hours: 9, minutes:30, seconds:30 }, radius:30};</b>\n\nThe first nested object, 'time' provides you with the data to position you hour, minute and seconds hands and the second 'radius' property tells you the radius of the clock that Dave wants to draw.\n\nYou must return an object that consists of an hours, minutes and seconds properties that are their own objects that hold the x and y locations of the end point of the hour, minute and seconds hands respectively:\n\n<b>{hours: {x: -17, y: 4}, minutes: {x: 0, y: -27}, seconds:{x:0,y:-24}};<b/>\n\nYou can assume that the centre of the clock is at position, {x:0, y:0} on a cartesian co-ordinate system. The hour hands length is 60% of the radius, the minute hands length is 90% of the radius and the seconds hand length is 80% of the radius.\n\nThe time values provided to you will be based on the 12 hour clock format so for the sake of this task, we can ignore the representation of AM and PM. It can also be assumed that the hour and minute hands with move in increments of 1 minute, so their position on the face of the clock will always point to a whole minute.\n\n<b>These links might be helpful to this Kata</b>\nhttp://www.teacherschoice.com.au/Maths_Library/Angles/Angles.htm\nhttps://math.stackexchange.com/questions/260096/find-the-coordinates-of-a-point-on-a-circle",
