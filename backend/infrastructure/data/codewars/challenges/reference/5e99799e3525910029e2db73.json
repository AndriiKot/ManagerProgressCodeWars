    "description": "In this kata you will be given two integer parameters `k` and `n` into a function `repeat` and you have to return a number in which k occurs n times. However the twist in this kata is that the builtin function `str()` is disabled. So you will have to figure a solution without using it.\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nrepeat(1,3) → 111\r\nrepeat(5,5) → 55555\r\nrepeat(123,4) → 123123123123\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Note:\r\n- The maximum value of k will be 10000 while the maximum value of n will be 100\r\n- Anybody solving this Kata in beta, please solve this kata without using the `str()` function and if you know how to disable the `str()` function, please edit the kata and disable it. I searched everywhere and could not find how to do it. I would be really grateful if you could do it :)\r\n",
