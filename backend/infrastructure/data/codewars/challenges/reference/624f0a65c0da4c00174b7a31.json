Go squash those bugs!\n\nStory: Bill is new to programming, and he is trying to make a basic program to get a name and greet the person with functions, but he keeps getting errors when he runs the code! Can you help him?\n\nHints:\n - Read the code carefully, very carefully.\n - Look for very minute errors in the code.\n - If you delete something, remember to keep what the original is trying to exucute.",
