    "description": "Continuation of [Office Space #1](https://www.codewars.com/kata/office-space-number-1-threes-from-twos/):\n\nYou like listening to music at the office.\n\nYou frequently have to change the volume in your headphones thanks to your talkative coworkers, and you find yourself using the `+` and `-` on your keyboard to do so.  \nThe keys increase and decrease the volume by `2` with each keystroke. There's just one problem - you prefer numbers that are divisible by `3`.\n\nSometimes your coworkers are loud, and other times they're at lunch or late to work - *Adjust the volume accordingly!*\n\nWrite a function that takes in current volume and outputs how many times you will have to press the `-` *or* `+` key on your keyboard to make the volume a number that is divisible by three.\n\nThe music can't go lower than `0` volume on this plane of existance.\n\nex: volume = `8` : output = `1` (*one* stroke of the `-` key would take you to `6`, which is divisible by `3`, rather than the *two* strokes of the `+` key to get to `12`)",
