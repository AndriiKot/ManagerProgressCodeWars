    "description": "Ever wanted to generate a password from a favorite phrase of yours? \n\nWell you will be given random encryption for the alphabet(all lowercase letters, using the ASCII table, where each letter from our alphabet will have a value where its length is between 2-4 characters.\n(this is preloaded into a HashMap (Java)\\ Dictionary (Python) for you)\n\n\nThere won't be an issue about certain letters in the language being similar like a = 12 and b = 123, there is only one solution for each encryption/decryption.\n\n\n\n    key: a , value: d8K\n    key: b , value: di\n    key: c , value: h)'N\n    .\n    .\n    .\n    key: z , value gG&\n\n\nYou will be given a phrase/string that is all lowercase and with no whitespaces. You will then need to encrypt the phrase using the given alphabet(in java it will be a HashMap).\nWith the decrypt function you will take an encrypted string and revert it back to the original phrase/string by decrypting it. \n\nFor example when given the phrase: ``\"mynameisjeff\"``,\nencryptCode result could be: ``\"KesP1/gDzqhk7Ke@x3@x3eIA\"``\n\nif we put ``\"KesP1/gDzqhk7Ke@x3@x3eIA\"`` into the decryptCode function then the function should return the original phrase ``\"mynameisjeff\"``.\n\nAnother example: now lets take the HM(HashMap) from above as our alphabet.\nlets take the phrase/string ``\"abcz\"`` and if we input it into the encryptCode function the following steps will happen:\n\n\n    String value = \"\" ;\n    a = d8K  -> value = d8K\n    b = di   -> value = d8Kdi\n    c = h)'N -> value = d8Kdih)'N\n    z = gG&  -> value = d8Kdih)'NgG&\n\n    value = \"d8Kdih)'NgG&\";\n\n\ntherefore in this case the encryptCode function will return ``\"d8Kdih)'NgG&\"``\n\nif we take the string  ``\"d8Kdih)'NgG&\"`` with the Encryption type given above(HM) and input it into the decryptCode function, in this case it will return the original string ``\"abcz\" ``\n\n\n\nYour task it to write the code for the encryptCode and decryptCode that will make it return the correct encrypted/decrypted results.",
