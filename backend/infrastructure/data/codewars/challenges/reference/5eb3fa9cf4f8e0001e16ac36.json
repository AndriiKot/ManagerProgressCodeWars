    "description": "This kata is a first step to solve [Hamiltonian cycle : create one! ](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5ea6f5d99fe5a2001e14ba13) . \n\nIn this kata your task is to check if a grid `a x b` admits a hamiltonian cycle (`a` and `b` are positive integers).  A hamiltonian cycle is a path which passes through all the points of the grid only once, and in which start and end position are the same. If you want to know more about hamiltonian cycles in general consult [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path) : in the case of a grid the problem <strong>is not</strong> NP-complete ; you can find a much simpler solution !\n\nOutput : return `True` if the grid admits a cycle otherwise return `False`.\n\nIn a grid `6 x 6` it's possible as this image shows :\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KACGelg.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nNote that you can move just horizontally or vertically to adiacjent squares.",
