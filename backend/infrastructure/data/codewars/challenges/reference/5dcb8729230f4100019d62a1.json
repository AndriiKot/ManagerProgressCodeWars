    "description": "In computing, we're taught about Binary, also known as Base 2, where we can count to any number using only the digits 0 and 1. In fact the premise behind any base `n` is that you count using only `n` unique numerals. But what happens when `n` isn't a whole number?\n\n**Task**\n\nGiven a number `x` in base 10, convert it to a `string` in base 2½.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nSince you can't have two and a half unique numerals, we will have to be more creative. We will count using the numerals `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`. Just as each digit in binary represents a power of 2 (e.g. `110` in base 2 is equivalent to `1×2² + 1×2¹ + 0×2⁰`), each digit in our base 2½ numbers will represent a power of 2½. For example, the number `42` in base 2½ can be written as `4×(2½)¹ + 2×(2½)⁰`, showing that it equals `12` when converted to base 10.\n\n**Examples**\n\n```javascript\nbaseTwoPointFive(12) === \"42\";\nbaseTwoPointFive(29) === \"404\";\n```\n```haskell\nbaseTwoPointFive 12 == \"42\"\nbaseTwoPointFive 29 == \"404\"\n```\n\n**Input Range**\n\nInputs will be within the range `0 <= x < 100000`.",
