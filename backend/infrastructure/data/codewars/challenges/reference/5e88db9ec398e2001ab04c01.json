    "description": "**TASK:**\n\nYou are given a time, in the form of a string: hh:mm:ss, and another time(how much time has passed), also in the form hh:mm:ss, and your task is to find what time is it after the second time has passed. IN other words, you're supposed to add them.\n\n**RETURN:**\n\nReturn your answer in the form \"hh:mm:ss\", in which mm and ss have to be below 60 and hh can be whatever it wants. If mm or ss was under 10, there would have to be a zero in front.\n\n**EXAMPLES:**\n\n```\nadd_time(\"1:30:19\", \"2:32:07\") returns \"4:02:26\"\nadd_time(\"12:19:17\", \"52:02:27\") returns '64:21:44'\nadd_time(\"6:12:32\", \"12:23:34\") returns '18:36:06'\nadd_time(\"10:38:45\", \"8:11:07\") returns '18:49:52'\nadd_time(\"0:13:45\", \"0:23:32\") returns '0:37:17'\n```",
