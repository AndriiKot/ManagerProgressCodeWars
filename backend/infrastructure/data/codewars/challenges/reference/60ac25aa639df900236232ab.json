    "description": "Fred owns a coffee shop. He needs to make a program to make the coffee shop run. And he dumps it on you. <i>Again</i>. \n\n# Notes #\nFor your <i>order</i> function, you will get something that looks like this:\n``` python\n[[20, \"L\"], [16, \"M\"]]\n```\nAnd will return this:\n``` python\n[20, \"L\", 16, \"M\"]\n```\n## Explanation ##\n\nThe list is the order. Each element contains the amount of coffee ordered in fluid ounces at index 0, and the size of the croissant at index 1. \n``` python\n\"L\"=3\n\"M\"=2\n\"S\"=1\n```\nAmounts listed in dollars\n\nThe calculate function will take output from your order function, and then give the price. Coffee is 3/8 of a dollar per oz.\n\n# NOTE #\nI AM WORKING ON THE SAMPLE TEST IT MIGHT TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS\n",
