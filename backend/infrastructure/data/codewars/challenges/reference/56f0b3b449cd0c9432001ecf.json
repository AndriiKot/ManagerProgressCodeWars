    "description": "# Token passing - Hack this code #2\nThere isn't much time to explain!\n\nGood, if you've been able to complete the first kata this one should be simple! Your task is to get the token and intercept and modify the result data to the main server, you have one chance at getting the token. Don't screw this up!\n\nOne thing this time, the Hack class will have the method ```get``` this method must be used to apply to the result value, it will be called when the result getter is called if you've hacked it right.\n\ngetResultByID must return an unmodified version of the result to compare to.\n\nGood luck and don't get caught.",
