    "description": "# Save your Soul!\n\nYou are trapped in an evil part of the underworld called the String. \nDo yourself a favour and remove _your_ soul from the String to avoid staying there for another eternety.\n\nYou can only save one soul, so be sure it is not mine, nor your friends' or any other loved ones soul you're about to save from Hades. \n\nReturn the String without your soul to find peace.\n\n### Hints:\n- I would adress your soul with __your__ soul but you might chose a __different possessive determiner__ to adress your own soul (for the sake of simplicity your soul will not be attributed in Hades)\n- you should recognice in any case (lower and higher) \n- leave everything behind: spaces and possesive determiners stay in the underworld!\n- check what comes after your soul, to be shure it is your soul and not your soul_food_!\n- punctation is limited: ```. , ?``` and ```!``` are possible\n- if you don't find your soul in Hades, you seem to be alive and there is no need to do anything (return the String unchanged)",
