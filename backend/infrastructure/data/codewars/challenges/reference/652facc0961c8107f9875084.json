Class `Human`is preloaded:\n\n```ts\nclass Human {\n    name: string,\n    type: number,\n    interests: Array<String>\n}\n```\n\nIf two people are attracted to each other by the type and have at least two interests in common... well.. then it's love!\n\nReturn an array of possible lovers as following:\n```js\n[\"Chriss + Mary\", \"Alla + Philipp\", ...]\n```\n\n\nA couple things to note:\n- Names in the couple should be in alphabetical order.\n- Return an empty array if love is not possible.\n\nP.S.\nThere will be no huge tests, and broken Humans.",
