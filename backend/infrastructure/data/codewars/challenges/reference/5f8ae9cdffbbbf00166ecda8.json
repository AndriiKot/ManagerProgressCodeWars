    "description": "\nA writer named Whirlwind Pigskin had finished a book about the hero's adventure, but he hadn't decided the name for it. After hours of thinking, he finally gave up and just randomly typed `n` characters on his keyboard which has 26 keys corresponding to each lowercase english letters. Whrilwind Pigskin glanced at this title and surprisedly found the hero's name contained in it. He was curious about this kind of phenomenon and he wanted you to tell him, if he types `n` characters on his keyboard in a **completely random** way to form his title, then what's the probability of the hero's name appearance in this title?\n\n**For the sake of precision, you shouldn't return the probability as a double. Instead, you should return `(the probability modulo 998244353)`.** Formally, since the probability can always be represented as a rational number `p/q`, you need to return `(q^-1) * p % 998244353`, where `q^-1` represents the multiplicative inverse of `q` (modulo `998244353`). Note that `998244353` is a prime number.\n\nIf you don't know how to calculate the multiplicative inverse, see the thrid section of [this article](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/module-inverse.html).\n\nTest cases satisfy that `1 <= n <= 10 ^ 18`, `1 <= L <= min(20, n)`, where `L` is the length of the hero's name. Also, all the characters in `name` are lowercase english letters.\n\nYou can check out another version of this kata [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5f8597e830b05d00195eb058). The only difference is the input range, and in this problem the alphabet is limited to lowercase english letters (`a-z`).\n\nIf you can still not understand this problem, you can check the explanation in sample tests.",
