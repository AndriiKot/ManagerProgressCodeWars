    "description": "You have been given the task of recreating a cipher. Three phrases have already been deciphered, but it is up to you to reverse engineer the cipher in order to re-create it (for some reason).\n\nUse the test examples and any other hints you see to figure out how this cipher may have been created.\n\nYour only hint: Spaces are not manipulated in any way. Whenever you encounter a Space, it should not be altered or moved.\n\nGood luck, I hope this one is hard.",
