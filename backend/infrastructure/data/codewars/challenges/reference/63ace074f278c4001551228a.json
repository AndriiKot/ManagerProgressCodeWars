    "description": "In this kata the input will be:\n  - A list of cards (anywhere from 10 to 20 cards). An example list is:\n     [\"Ace of Clubs\", \"2 of Spades\", \"Jack of Hearts\", \"King of Spades\", \"10 of Diamonds\"]\n \nAnd the output will be:\n  - A number \n  \nThe output will represent the average score of a hand you would draw.
