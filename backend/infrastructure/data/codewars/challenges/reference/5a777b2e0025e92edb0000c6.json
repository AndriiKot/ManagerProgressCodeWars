    "description": "You are a student in a Futuristic coding class. The class is very competitive, and the teacher will not allow any talking during class. There is an instant-messaging system, which allows the students to communicate about class projects, but it is being watched. The teacher built an Artificial Intelligence that reads all of the messages sent between students and notifies the teacher if the content of the message is unrelated to the assignment. However, you've discovered a flaw in the design. \n\nThe AI only reads words that are written with proper spelling. Therefore, if you run your message thorugh an 'encrypter' that changes the spelling of most words, the AI will not notify the teacher, and you can 'pass notes' to your friends. \n_________________________\n\nTASK: write a function that replaces each vowel of a word with it's natrually ensuing vowel. In order to deceive the AI, we ought to include 'y' with the vowles. \n\nVowles have a natural order: \n\n1-->'a', 2-->'e', 3-->'i', 4-->'o',5-->'u', and 6-->'y'. for every value that occurs in a word, we want to replace it with the next vowel in the natural order. However, if the vowel is 'y', then we should  replace it with 'i'. \n\nThus, \n''' codify('happy') #--> 'heppi' ''' \nand\n''' codify('birthday') #--> 'borthdei' '''\n\n\n\n",
