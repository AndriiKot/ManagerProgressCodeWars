    "description": "Scrabble is a word game in which two to four players score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter, onto a game board divided into a 15×15 grid of squares. The tiles must form words that, in crossword fashion, read left to right in rows or downward in columns, and be included in a standard dictionary or lexicon.\n\nIn this kata you will make a program to assist scrabble players. It will take an input as a list of letters and then it will output a dictionary with all the possible scrabble approved words that can be formed from those letters along with their scores. It should be ordered in a descending fashion by the score the person gets if it plays that word (ignoring all the special tiles).\n\nThe score of a word is determined by adding up the scores of all its constituent letters. You have been given a dictionary `scores` mapping each letter to its respective score to aid your task.\n\nYou are also given a set named `wordset` which contains all of the scrabble approved words.\n\nExamine the following examples to understand the output:\n\n```python \nscrabble(['a','b']) → {'ba': 4, 'ab': 4}\nscrabble(['a','b','c']) → {'bac': 7, 'cab': 7, 'ba': 4, 'ab': 4}\nscrabble(['c','o','d','e']) → {'deco': 7, 'ecod': 7, 'coed': 7, 'code': 7, 'doc': 6, 'cod': 6, 'eco': 5, 'doe': 4, 'ode': 4, 'do': 3, 'od': 3, 'ed': 3, 'de': 3, 'oe': 2}\n```",
