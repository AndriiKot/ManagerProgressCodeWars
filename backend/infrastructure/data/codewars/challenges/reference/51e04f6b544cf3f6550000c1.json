    "description": "Let's pretend your company just hired your friend from college and paid you a referral bonus. Awesome! To celebrate, you're taking your team out to the terrible dive bar next door and using the referral bonus to buy, and build, the largest three-dimensional beer can pyramid you can. And then probably drink those beers, because let's pretend it's Friday too. \n\nA beer can pyramid will square the number of cans in each level - 1 can in the top level, 4 in the second, 9 in the next, 16, 25... \n\nComplete the beeramid function to return the number of **complete** levels of a beer can pyramid you can make, given the parameters of: \n\n1) your referral bonus, and\n\n2) the price of a beer can\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nreferral bonus ------> 1500\nprice of a beer can -> 2\nexpected output -----> 12\n\nreferral bonus ------> 5000\nprice of a beer can -> 3\nexpected output -----> 16\n```\n",
