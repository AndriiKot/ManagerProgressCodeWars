    "description": "two friends are playing a game which they call \"find me\", in which each one of them choose a number of 5 positions with no repeated digits (a number should not start by 0) and then try to find the other's number through this simple steps :\n\nEach time both players guess a number and pass it to the other for verification which consists of returning how many common and well placed digits are there in the guessed number compared to the original. For example:\nlet 23541 be the number that bob chooses and 69537 the number guessed by mario, in this case the verification will be: \n  - Common = 2 since 3 and 5 exists in 23541\n  - Well placed = 1 since 5 is in the right position\n\nAs you can see verification is very important in this game and unfortunatuly bob struggles sometimes, so your task is to help him verificate mario's number and return a string of common and well placed digits and a comment separated by space.\nA comment is chosen by the number of well placed digits:\n  - zero or one: helpful\n  - two or three: confusing\n  - four : almost\n  - five : congrats\n\nThe result will take a form like: \"2 3 confusing\" where 2 is yhe number of common digits and 3 is the number of well placed ones.\nBe aware that mario likes messing somtimes and give wrong numbers, so you have to also check the form of input, in case of wrong input you must return \"wrong!\"(you do not have to check for the first argument).
