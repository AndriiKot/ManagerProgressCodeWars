    "description": "In this series we are gonna write a lot of string manipulation functions for a gramatical and spelling application.\n\nWrite a function ```wrongCapitalization``` that takes a string and returns an array of letters that are improperly capitalized based on punctioation.\n\nThe first word in a string should ALWAYS start with a capital letter\nThe first word after . : ? or ! (the first word in a period) should also ALWAYS start with a capital letter.\n\nFor now don't bother with any other letter than the first letter of the first word of a string or period. Don't upcase the letters, or find their index for now.\n\nThis info is enough to start the assignment. Check the basic tests if you are in doubt of what to return, and read on if you want some more background information:\n\nThis kata is meant to be an example of when to use a regular expression. If you haven't used a regular expression before, this is a prime oppertunity to learn. Head on to http://rubular.com/ to test your regexp, it even has a few syntax guides. Or check out the rubydoc https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Regexp.html for examples and a deeper look into what regexp can do.\n\nIf you can create the propper pattern the solution will easily fit in one line between the ```def``` and ```end``` keywords. I have provided you with some sample code of how to use scan, so you only need to develop the right regexp\n\n\n",
