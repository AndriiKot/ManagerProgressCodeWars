    "description": "Given the mass and diameter of a solid cylinder, as well as the angle and height of a triangle, find the the time it would take for the cylinder to roll from the apex to the bottom of the triangle's hypotenuse. \n\nSteps:\n\n    Determine the Triangle's Geometry:\n        Angle (θ): The angle of the inclined plane with respect to the horizontal.\n        Height (h): The vertical height from the base to the top.\n\n    Cylinder's Properties:\n        Diameter (D): The diameter of the cylinder.\n        Radius (r): r = D / 2\n        Mass (m): The mass of the cylinder.\n        Moment of Inertia (I): For a solid cylinder, I = (1 / 2) m r^2\n\n    Calculate the Inclined Plane's Length:\n    The length of the hypotenuse of the triangle (L) can be found using the height and angle:\n    L = h / sin⁡(θ)\n\n    Find the Acceleration of the Cylinder:\n    The acceleration aa of the cylinder rolling down the incline can be derived from the force of gravity and the rolling constraint:\n    a = g sin⁡(θ) / (1 + I / (m r^2))\n\n    For a solid cylinder:\n    a = {g sin⁡(θ) / (1 + (((1/2) m r^2) / (m r^2)))} = {g sin⁡(θ) / (1 + 1/2)} = {2g sin⁡(θ) / 3}\n\n    This formula is actually the same as for a solid disk because the moment of inertia is the same for a solid cylinder.\n\n    Calculate the Time to Reach the End of the Triangle:\n    Using the kinematic equation for constant acceleration:\n    L = (1 / 2) a t^2\n\n    Solve for tt:\n    t = √(2L / a)\n    \nTips:\n- Make sure you convert to radians!\n\nSpecifications:\n- If angle == 360, return a -1\n- Round output to the hundredths place\n- Assume gravity = 9.81\n- Assume no slippage, no air resistance, or anything of the sort\n- All inputs will be positive integers",
