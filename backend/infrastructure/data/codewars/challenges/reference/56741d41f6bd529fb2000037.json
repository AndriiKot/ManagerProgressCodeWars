    "description": "# Mr. Dickens' Needs Help!\n\nOkay. Here's the deal. Mr. Charles Dickens has been given an algebra class to teach!  He doesn't really get it (at all) but needs the money. His books are not selling very well and he needs to eat!\n\nHe does have access to a computer terminal, from the future. He can send and receive very limited messages.\n\nThe first class that he has to teach, is just about grouping variables into monomials.\n\n## Today's Lesson\nIn his math primer, there are a couple of examples...\n\n`x+x` = `2x`\n\n`x+x+x+y+y+y+y+z+z` = `3x + 4y + 2z`\n\nHe cannot send you any more information for fear of disrupting the space-time continuum, but if you were to create a function that would run on his computer and allow him to correct the exercises \nbefore the students come in, that would be great. \n\n## Things to keep in mind\n\n- the variables should be sorted alphabetically in the final expression.\n\n- all variables must be lower case in the final expression.\n\n- return \"Input Error\" on invalid input\n\nMr. Dickens really wants to get his exercises out so when his terminal malfunctions and produces an empty string, or null / undefined, make sure it warns him he needs to redo the exercise by returning \"Input Error\". As well, if he accidently hits a key by mistake (and generates a variable of length > 1).\n\nNote as well, because Mr. Dickens is teaching introductory algebra, he wants to reduce any extraneous cognitive load so he wants 1x to be written exactly like that (vs just x) to make it easier for later when he teaches powers and multiplication. If you don't like Mr. Dicken's practices - well just don't take his classes.\n\n--------------------------------\n*If you are wondering how he got his hands on this future tech, I believe that it came from his run-in with The Doctor...",
