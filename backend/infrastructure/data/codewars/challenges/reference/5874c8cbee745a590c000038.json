    "description": "Okay so this is number 4 in a series and we're taking a step back...\n\nSo far we've solved 9 x 9 sudoku grids that were incredibly simple and only missing a few falues, now we have to bring different choices into the mix and are going to be solving 4 x 4 grids.\n\nYour program will have to be able to take a 4 x 4 grid as a 2d array of integers and return a complete grid in the same format.\n\nFor more on the rules; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku\n\nHave fun!\n\n:)",
