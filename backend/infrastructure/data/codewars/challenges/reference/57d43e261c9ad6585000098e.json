    "description": "Find if the number given is happy number or a sad number.\n\nA happy number found with the following process: given any positive integer (less than 10000), replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number either equals ```1``` (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers).\n\nif the number is happy return ```true```, otherwise return ```false```.",
