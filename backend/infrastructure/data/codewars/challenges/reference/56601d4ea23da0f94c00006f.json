    "description": "We would like to have a function that given any date in the calendar would output the full name of the date \"Day, Number(th/st/nd/rd), Month, Year\" so we can feed it random dates and get a nice output.\n\nWe have two initial arrays, one contains the months and the other one the days of the week.\n\nThere is also the final function to guide you a little bit about the output that it is expected. \n\n```javascript\nfunction FullDate(day, month, year) {\n    var full_date = daysofweek[DayOfWeek(day, month, year)] + ' ' + \n              day + Nths(day) + '  ' +  monthsofyear[month-1] + '  ' + year;\n    return full_date;\n}\n```\n\nWhat you need to do:\n\nComplete the following functions (Nths) and (DayOfWeek) to create dates in the specified required output.\n\nThe test example dates are some of the most important dates in astronomy and physics, if you feel curious about those :)",
