    "description": "Hello again fellow coders!\n\nIf you don't know, I previously made a kata on solving quadratic equations. I suggest you read about / attempt the kata here: https://www.codewars.com/kata/quadratic-solver-part-1/train/python\n\nThis one, however, is a little more advanced.\n\nIf you're not familiar, the quadratic formula is:\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Quadratic_formula.svg/2000px-Quadratic_formula.svg.png\" alt=\"Image result for quadratic formula\"/>\n\nIn this challenge, you will be given 3 numbers and will have to return the factorised version of the equation as a string. The sorting should be that of which the smaller number in the bracket is first. The solutions should be rounded to one decimal place.\n\nIn this kata, a will always be 1 to reduce confusion.\n\nExample: Say that b=8 and c=16, your solution should return the following string:\n```python\n\"(x+4.0)(x+4.0)\"\n```\n\nLittle note: You may have an issue where in this case it returns:\n```python\n\"(x+4)(x+4)\"\n```\n\nPlease ensure it returns it as a float even if it is a whole number.\n\nIf you have any questions please feel free to ask and if there are any issues let me know! This is my second and most complicated kata I have made so far so I'm sure it's a little confusing to understand or the solutions are a little messed up, so sorry about that in advance. :)",
