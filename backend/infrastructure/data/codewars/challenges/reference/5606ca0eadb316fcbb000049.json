    "description": "You are driving a car and your path lies through a rectangular road, that consists of `n` lanes and `m` segments. At the end you pay money depending on the lanes you've chosen passing through this road. Luckily, you have a map of this road, showing ths costs of all the sections, and some time to plan your route.\n\nWhen entering the segment you can't change your lane until the end of it. That means that you can change your lane only between segments and only to neighbouring lanes, or you can stay on the lane you are.\n\nYour task is to find the cheapest way and return the amount of money you'll have to pay.\n\ne.g. (moving left to right):\n```javascript\ncheapestRoute([\n  [ 1, 32, 19,  9, 5 ],\n  [ 4,  8, 30,  6, 5 ],\n  [ 5, 17, 18, 10, 6 ],\n  [ 9, 13,  4, 11, 7 ]\n]); // should return 37\n```\nThe cheapest path is `5 + 13 + 4 + 10 + 5 = 37`.\n\nHave fun!)",
