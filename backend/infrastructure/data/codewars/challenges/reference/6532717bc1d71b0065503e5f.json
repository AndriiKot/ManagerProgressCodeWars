    "description": "Given a string of letter grades, separated by spaces, return the GPA.\n\nBackground:\n\nGrade point average is a way of reducing a student's grades from various classes into one score. Each class is scored as follows...\n\n- A => 4 points\n- B => 3 points\n- C => 2 points\n- D => 1 point\n- F => 0 points\n\n...and the GPA is the average of those scores. For example, a student with four As and one B would have a 3.8 grade point average. \n\nDetails:\n- A student will usually have five grades, but it could be any amount\n- Some grades may come with a plus or minus, but those have no effect on this calculation and should be ignored (e.g. A+ counts the same as A)\n- An empty input should result in a 0.0 GPA\n- Inputs will be otherwise valid: no surprise characters, no surprise types\n- Round to two decimal places",
