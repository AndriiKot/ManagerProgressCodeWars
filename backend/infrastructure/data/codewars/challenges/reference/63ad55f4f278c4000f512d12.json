    "description": "A sine wave, sinusoidal wave, or just sinusoid is a mathematical curve defined in terms of the sine trigonometric function, of which it is the graph. It is a type of continuous wave and also a smooth periodic function. It occurs often in mathematics, as well as in physics, engineering, signal processing and many other fields. More information [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave)\n\n![sinus wave](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Sin.svg)\n\nBasically, the reduced form of a wave takes the form \n```math\ny(t) = A sin (\\omega t + \\phi)\n``` \nat where \n* **A** is the amplitude, \n* **`$\\omega$`, omega** the angular frequency \n* **`$\\phi$`, phi** the phase\n\nGiven the three parameters and a ```time delay ```(`$ \\delta t$`) return an Iterator that can produces the signal plotted in intervals of  `$ \\delta t$`, the results can have a error of 0.01 units (you can use approximate solution whit 2 significant digits).\n\nFor example:\n\n* A = 3 m\n* `$ \\omega $` = 2 rad/seg\n* `$\\phi$` = 0 rad\n* `$\\delta t$` = 0.1 s\n\nproduces\n* i = 0 -> y(0) = 3 * sin(0) = 0\n* i = 1 -> y(0.1) = 3* sin(2*0.1) = 0.59\n* i = 2 -> y(0.2) = 3* sin(2*0.2) = 1.16\n* i = 3 -> y(0.3) = 3* sin(2*0.3) = 1.69\n\nNote:\n* The iterator must be unbounded.\n* Time interval will always be positive.\n* The initial state is t=0 and must be returned at first iteration\n",
