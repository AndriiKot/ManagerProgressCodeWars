    "description": "# Gradually discounted milk price\n\nWe have to implement a `milkPrice` function that returns the milk price reduced by a volume discount system that will lower the milk price per liter every 2 liters of milk.\n\nThe discount system is very simple, every 2 litres the milk price is reduced by $0.05.\n\nFor example\n\n```\nPrice per liter: $1.23 you buy 5 liters\n\n2 liters at 1.18\n2 liters at 1.13\n1 liters at 1.13\n\nMilk price: $5.75\n```\n\nThe final result should be rounded with only 2 decimals.\n\nNote: partial liters should be managed.\n",
