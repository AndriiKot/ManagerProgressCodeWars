    "description": "Houda is looking for an internship in her dream company, the recruter asked her a question:\n\nGiven an array of size `n` and an integer `k`,we define the value of the array is the sum of all it's elements, except the first `floor(n/k)` elements. \n\ncan you partition the given array, into multiple subarrays such that the sum of the values of those subarrays is minimized ?\n\nfor example giving an array `[1, 4, 5, 6, 8]` and integer `k = 2` the value of the array is \n`sum([1, 4, 5, 6, 8]) - sum([1, 4, 5, 6, 8][0: floor(n/k)]) = 19`\n\nlet's look at an example, imagine you have the array `[1, 1, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10, 10, 10]` and `k=10`\nyou can consider the value of the whole array and that will give you the sum of the array minus the sum of the `floor(n/k)` smallest elements so the value is going to be `sum([1, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]) = 100` (we removed the smallest `floor(n/k) = 1` element which is `1`), but if we split the array into `[1, 1] and [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10, 10, 10]` the value is going to be `92` because we dont remove anything from the first array because `n/k = 2 / 10 = 0`, and we remove `9` from the second array because it's the smallest element and `n/k = 10/10 = 1`\nso the total value is `2 + 99 - 9 = 92` and that's the best partition possible .\n\n## Input \n\n- an array with size `n` and integer `k`\n- `1 <= n, k <= 5000`\n- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000000000`\n\n## Output\n\n- The minimum value you can get after partitionning the array in to 1 or more subarrays\n\n",
