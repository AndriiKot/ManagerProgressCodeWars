    "description": "The doomsday algorithm is a way of calculating the day of the week. It was designed to be performed mentally, but we are going to adapt it into code anyway!\n\nIn order to perform the algorithm we need to go through 2 different steps.\n\n1. find the anchor day based on the month and year\n2. count the amount of days in between the anchor and the desired date (modulus 7)\n\nUsually you would have to calculate the doomsday for the month, but we are giving that bit to you easy style!\n\n## Tips\n* A table with anchor days is provided [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule#Overview_of_all_Doomsdays)\n* We have provided various variables to help make the program better to write these are:\n  * Days of the week values (MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY etc...)\n  * Months (JANUARY, FEBRUARY, MARCH etc...)\n",
