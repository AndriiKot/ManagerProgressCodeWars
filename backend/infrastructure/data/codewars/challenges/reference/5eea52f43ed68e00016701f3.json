    "description": "Bob has a ladder. He wants to climb this ladder, but being a precocious child, he wonders in exactly how many ways he could climb this `n` size ladder using jumps of up to distance `k`.\n\nConsider this example...\n\n    n = 5\n    k = 3\n\nHere, Bob has a ladder of length `5`, and with each jump, he can ascend up to `3` steps ( he can climb either `1`, `2`, or `3` steps at a time, each time ). This gives the following possibilities:\n\n    1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 2\n    1 1 2 1 \n    1 2 1 1\n    2 1 1 1\n    1 2 2\n    2 2 1\n    2 1 2\n    1 1 3\n    1 3 1\n    3 1 1\n    2 3\n    3 2\n\nYour task is to calculate for Bob the number of ways to climb a ladder of length `n` in steps up to `k` ( `13` in above case ).\n\nConstraints:\n\n```javascript\n1 <= n <= 50\n1 <= k <= 15\n```",
