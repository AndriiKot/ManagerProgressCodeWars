    "description": "In the distant future...\n\nOur hero, DUKE JENDAR, Star Federation ace pilot, finds himself in formation over a Federation planet, waiting to do battle with the EVIL SOLAR IMPERIUM. As the opposing fleets get into possition, our hero notices something! The IMPERIUM has secretly launched a thermonuclear missile at the capital city of the plannet down below! Bravely, our hero breaks formation to chase down the missile...\n\nThe missile will hit the planet in 30 seconds, given the speed of our hero, the speed the missile, and the inital distance between the two, write a function that returns true if our hero gets to the missile in time, and false if he is to late. The missile is considered \"intercepted\" if, at any point, the total distance traveled by the hero is equal to, or greater than, the distance travelled by the missile. The initial distance is considered part of the total distance traveled by the missile.",
