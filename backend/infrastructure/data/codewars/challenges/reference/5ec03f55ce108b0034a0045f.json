    "description": "You are given an array of integers and an integer sum.\n\nYour challenge is to find all the ways you can create that sum from consecutive sequences within the array.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nrolling_sum([1,2,3,4,5],5) == 2 \n# because you can add [2,3] and you already have [5]\n\nrolling_sum([1,1,1,1,1],3) == 3 \n# because you have the first 3 ones, the second 3 ones and the third 3 ones\n\nrolling_sum([1,4,1,4,1], 7) == 0 \n# because even though we could make 7, we can't do it with consecutive numbers\n```\n\nBrute force will work for the preliminary tests, but you'll have to do better for the ultimate challenge.\n\nBe wary of the case where the sum == 0. It is non-trivial. Think about it like \n\n```\nsomestring.count('')\n```",
