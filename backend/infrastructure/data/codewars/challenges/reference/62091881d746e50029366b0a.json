    "description": "UTF-8 is a variable length character encoding (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)\n\nWhile UTF-8 is binary safe (in the sense that UTF-8 encoded strings never contain zeros) standard libc string functions do not work properly on UTF-8 input as they operate under the premise that one character spans exactly one byte.\n\nAs an example, `strlen(\"müde\")` returns 5 even though \"müde\" is comprised of 4 UTF-8 characters (m,ü,d,e).\n\nYour job is to write a UTF-8 aware string length function that returns the number of UTF-8 character code points contained in a UTF-8 encoded buffer.\n\n`uint32_t utf8_strlen(char *);`\n\nUTF-8 encodings that exceed 4 bytes are considered invalid input (as they are not currently mapped in the unicode standard) so your input will only consist of UTF-8 characters that can be encoded as 4 bytes or less.\n\nIf your function encounters invalid input (illegal UTF8, e.g. missing continuation bytes, etc) it must return zero.",
