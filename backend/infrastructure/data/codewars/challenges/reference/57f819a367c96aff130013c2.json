    "description": "Honald Chump is in trouble.  He is behind Dillary Tilton in the polls and can't keep his foot out of his mouth.  Tuesday November 8 is quickly approaching, so it is time for an alternate political strategy - hack the election!\n\nHonald has hired you to hack into the voting systems in a few key states and alter the results, but without being detected.\n\nLucky for you budget cuts mean the voting machines purchased were, well, poorly designed.  The voting machine has a simple checksum-like method for security.  When a voter chooses a candidate three things happen:\n<ol>\n<li>The first letter of the candidates last name gets added to an array.</li>\n<li>The vote count is incremented</li>\n<li>The character code of the first letter of the last name is added to the previous checksum value.  Then that value is divided by a secret key with the remainder being stored as the new checksum.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\nAfter the election is over the Elections Department counts the values in the array in #1 to see who won as well to ensure the count and checksum matches.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe developers of this code accidently put the code that generates the \"secret key\" on GitHub.  It appears to be based on the date of the election.<br />\n<code>\nvar secret_key = (monthOfElectionIndex * dayOfElectionIndex) - dayOfWeekOfElectionIndex \n</code><br />\nWhere January has a month index of 1 and Sunday has a day of week index of 1.\n</p>\n<p>Other hackers working for Chump have infliltrated the network and can intercept the array from #1 above.  Your job is to alter that array in such a way as to both ensure Chump wins and that the values from #2 and #3 are maintained so as to keep the pesky media at bay.\n</p>",
