    "description": "Mahjong is an ancient game in China, which spreads all over the world. But how can we check if a set of tiles is a winning set?\n\nTo simplify the question, we assume that the tiles have only one suit. And we ignore the situation that it has chi-ed, pon-ed and kan-ed. You will get a string like \"11122233344455\" to describe a set of tiles. Your algorithm should return a boolean to tell if it's a winning set.\n\n```ruby\nwinning_set?('11122233344455') #-> true\nwinning_set?('11123456789999') #-> true\nwinning_set?('11223556677788') #-> false\n```\n\n```haskell\nwinningSet [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5] `shouldBe` True\nwinningSet [1,1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,9,9,9] `shouldBe` True\nwinningSet [1,1,2,2,3,5,5,6,6,7,7,7,8,8] `shouldBe` False\n```\n\n#### Tips:\n\nA set without chii, pon and kan will have exactly 14 tiles, and at most 4 of a kind.  \n\nMost of winning sets are like XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX-YY, in which XXX is ABC or AAA.  \n```\n11122233344455 -> 111-222-333-444-55  \n11123456789999 -> 123-456-789-999-11  \n```\nA special set of tiles is AABBCCDDEEFFGG means seven pairs, like 11224455667788. there should not be any same pairs in it (Japanese Mahjong rules).  \n\n**Note:** Four of a kind like AAAA can not appear in this special form.\n\n",
