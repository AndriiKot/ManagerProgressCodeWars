    "description": "Your programmed RPG monster really wants to win this fight but to do so it needs to kill one of the player's characters right now.\n\nHelp him with a method that checks a dictionary and returns the name for the lowest HP Between non-KOed Characters (Characters with more than 0 HP)\n\nIn the case that more than one character has the same positive HPs then return the first character found. If there is no character with more than 0 hp return the String \"Victory Achieved!!!\"\n\nAs an Example if you get the following characters as an input:\n\n  {\"Leonardo \":15,\"Raphael\":0,\"Donatello\":12,\"Michael Angelo\":12}\n  \nThen your output should be \"Donatello\" since he is the first character with lowest non zero hp\n\nAll Inputs will be a valid dictionary of key String for the name of the character and zero or positive integer for the value that represents that character HPs.",
