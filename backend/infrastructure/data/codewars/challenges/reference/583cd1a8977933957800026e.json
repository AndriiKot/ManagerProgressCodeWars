    "description": "Manuel is looking to bake the delicious Portuguese custard tarts called Natas. He has this massive recipe e-book with loads of recipe titles and he is finding it difficult to find what he needs.\n\nTo make his life easier all you need to do is to create a `search` function that highlights the word he is searching for on title of the recipes.\n\nThe function will receive the word he searched for and an array of strings. You will then need to find that word and return the text array with the tags `<b></b>` around the searched word.\n\n* Manuel will only search for **one** word at a time\n* You should allow the same word to be found many times in the title.\n* The search should not be **case-sensitive**.",
