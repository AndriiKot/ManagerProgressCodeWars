    "description": "# Description\n\nYou've been contracted by a few botanists to validate some data!\nYou'll need to write a function that shows each botanist whether or not the ratio of **heliotropic** flowers and non-heliotropic flowers.  \n\nYou can tell the difference between the two based on whether they face the sun or not (or rather, if they are round characters like `O`, `0`, and `@`).\nNon-heliotropic flowers will have flat character representations, like `-`, `_`, and `|` for example.  \nYou are given a string `flowers` to parse for these characters, and a float `tolerance` that dictates how much the ratio must be (at the very least).  \nOh, and if you're given an empty string, you can safely return `false` because a field of **nothing** isn't heliotropic! Same goes for a `tolerance` value of `NULL` or `0`.\n\n# Examples\n\n`heliotropic(\"O O | O O | O\", 0.5)` -> `true`, because the number of total number of flowers divided by the number of heliotropic flowers results in a number greater than (or equal to) 0.5, which was given as the `tolerance` value.  \n\n`heliotropic(\"@ 0 | - 0 _ O\", 0.75` -> `false`, because the number of total number of flowers divided by the number of heliotropic flowers results in a number less than 0.75, you get the idea.",
