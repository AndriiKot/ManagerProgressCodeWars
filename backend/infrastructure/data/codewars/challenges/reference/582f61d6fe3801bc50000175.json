    "description": "You are lost. You have a watch and know how to find North...if you know what hemisphere you're on. After wandering aimlessly for days you manage to find a toilet. Noticing the way the water swirls you now know what hemisphere you're on.\n\nGiven a hemisphere (`'North'` or `'South'`) and using your trusty analog watch find what 'time' is north given a certain time.\n\nOn the Northern hemisphere if you point the hour hand at the sun and divide the smaller angle to the 12 o' clock marker in half you get south, so the opposite direction is north.\n\nOn the Southern hemisphere if you point the 12 o' clock marker at the sun and divide the smaller angle to the hour hand you get north.\n\nFor example on the Northern hemisphere at 4 o' clock exactly, halfway to the 12 o' clock marker is 2. But this is south, so the opposite is 8.\n\nRemember this can work anytime so at 4:30 north is at 8:15 (or where the hour hand would point at 8:15) on the northern hemisphere. Hint: `06:00` will evaluate North as `09:00` on the northern hemisphere, but `06:02` will be `03:01` (northern hemisphere).\n\nYou want the exact return in `hh:mm` format (hh - 00-12, mm - 00-59), which is also the format your watch gives",
