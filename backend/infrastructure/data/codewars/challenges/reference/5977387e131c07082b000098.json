    "description": "Betsy's recently taken a test and she is just about to get her results. \nHer school have an online system where each student will recieve a message telling them whether they've passed or failed.\n\nComplete the function to give the 3 strings ```str1, str2, str3``` the correct values to ensure that each student recieves the right message. 70 is the pass mark, so create a function that uses this grade boundary and returns either:\n\n- \"Sorry, you have failed. Better luck next time!\"\n\nor \n\n\n- \"Congratulations, you have passed!\"\n\nWhether they pass or fail, both strings end with this string: \n\n- \"Thank you for taking part.\"\n\nThings to note: \n\n- The grade boundary is 70 and is **inclusive** with the score of 70 considered a pass.\n- You can use the String .concat() method or any other method you see fit to bring the strings together.\n- Scores cannot be lower than 0 and will always be given as a number\n\n \n\n",
