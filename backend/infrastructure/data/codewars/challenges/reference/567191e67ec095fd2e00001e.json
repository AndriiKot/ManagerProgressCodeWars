    "description": "The ouroboros or uroboros (/jʊərɵˈbɒrəs/; /ɔːˈrɒbɔrəs/, from the Greek οὐροβόρος ὄφις tail-devouring snake) is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.\n\nThe ouroboros often symbolizes self-reflexivity or cyclicality, especially in the sense of something constantly re-creating itself, the eternal return, and other things such as the phoenix which operate in cycles that begin anew as soon as they end.\n\n![Ouroboros](http://i.imgur.com/rzINCtH.png)\n\nYour task is to implement a function that will receive an array and return elements from it, if it is over it will start anew.\n\nNote: The local tests are not working properly, the way to test it will depend on your solution.\n\nHint: Something on ES2015 can help you.",
