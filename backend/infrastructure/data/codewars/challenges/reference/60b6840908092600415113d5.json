    "description": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGMRB4O922I\">Mandelbrot set</a> is the set of complex numbers c for which the function: \n\nf<sub>c</sub>(z) = z<sup>2</sup> + c\n\ndoesn't diverge (i.e. gets increasingly large in magnitide) when iterated from z = 0. Thus for a complex numbers to be in the Mandelbrot set it must remain bounded (more precisely |z| < 2) when iterated infinitely many times through the function.\n\nBut how then are we to decide whether a given complex number is in the set or not? We don't have forever, and even then <i>'infinitely many times'</i> is just one too many.\n\nSo instead of trying to do the impossible we set ourselves a limit for how many times a given complex number must be iterated (whilst remaining below 2 in magnitude) to be accepted into the Mandelbrot set. \n\nBut why are we interested in this in the first place you might ask? Well, here is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set\">visualisation</a> of an area in the Mandelbrot set in the complex plane. The colors indicate the amount of iterations before the complex number at that point began diverging. Pretty cool right?\n\n![Mandelbrot set](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Mandel_zoom_14_satellite_julia_island.jpg)\n\n<h2>Task</h2>\n\nYour task is write a function that takes in a complex number c (as a string) and a positive integer n and returns a boolean value to indicate whether c is in the Mandelbrot set or not when f<sub>c</sub>(z) is iterated n times. Expect n to be as big as 10<sup>4</sup>.\n\nThe input string will always be valid and formatted like this:\n```python\n'x + yi'\n\n```\n\nExamples of input strings:\n```python\n'0.1 + 0.1i'\n'0.335339261 - 0.564117944i'\n'-1.22030 - 0.12806572658i'\n```\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n",
