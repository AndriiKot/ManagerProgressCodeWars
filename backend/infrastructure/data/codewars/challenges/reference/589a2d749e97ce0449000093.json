    "description": "A shop has asked you to create a script to determine how much of a discount a customer should receive if they pay over a certain amount.  Here are your criteria:\n1. If the customer pays 300 or more, they get 50 off the total price of their shop\n2. If the customer pays 450 or more, they get 100 off the total price of their shop\n3. The customer can not receive both discounts at once.\n\nYou have to create 1 function that takes one parameter and determine the discount the customer should get.\nFor example:\ncost = 450 => 350 returned\ncost = 300 => 250 returned\ncost = 299 => 299 returned",
