    "description": "A new civilisation has been found! Remarkably, their language is identical to English but with one key difference: their proper nouns (words with one capital letter: e.g London) are all reversed. We need a translator to help us communicate with them.\n\nYour task is to write a function named 'capitalReverse', which takes a string and reverses all words within that string which contain exactly one capital letter.\n\nAny words within the string which contain no capital letters or more than one capital letter should be ignored (not reversed).\n\nThe string should be returned with the sentence in its orignal order, with only the matching words reversed (a matching word contains exactly one capital letter)\n\nFor example: 'this should not be reversed' should be left unchanged as there are no words with capital letters.\nWhereas: 'sihT should be reversed' should become 'This should be reversed'. With 'sihT' reversed as it contains exactly one capital letter.\n\nGood luck !\n\nWrite your code inside the capitalReverse function in main.js, and then use npm run test to check if your function passes all of the test cases.\n\nThe input for all tests will be a string.",
