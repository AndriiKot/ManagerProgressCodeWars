    "description": "A quine is a program, that takes no input and produces an exact copy of its own source code as its only output.\n\nYour Task is to write something slightly different:<br>\nLet's say `abcd` is the source code of your program. When executed the only output should be `abcdabcd`, so twice the original source code. Now if `abcdabcd` is executed, its output should be `abcdabcdabcd`, that is three times the original source code.\n\nOutput here refers to everything written to `stdout`, when run as a script.\n\nIn general your source code repeated `n` times, should output your source code repeated `n+1` times, when executed. Also your program must be nonempty and must not access its own source code.",
