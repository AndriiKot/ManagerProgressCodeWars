    "description": "## The Problem\n\nTeddy is a young boy interested in computers. His parents promised to buy him Lego Mindstorms for Christmas so he can learn new things. He can't wait for that to happen and he decided to start counting down the days. However, he wants to use a computer to do that. He learned a bit of coding but he got stuck when trying to solve the problem.\n\n## What To Do\n\nCreate `daysLeft` function that will take current date and return number of days left until Christmas (December 25).\n\nAccepted date format is dd-mm (any symbol can be used as a separator, like `:`, `/` etc). Day/month can but doesn't have to be padded with 0 (eg. 09-06 and 9-6 are valid). \n\nAlso, there's a `calendar` array at your disposal. It consists of objects with keys being integers 1 - 12. Each of them stores a numeric value which is a number of days in a corresponding month, eg:\n`{1: 31}`.\n\nExpected output is a number of days until December 25 (but excluding the Christmas day itself). However, make sure to include the day passeed as input in your calculations and *validate the input date*. If the input is invalid, return `false`.",
