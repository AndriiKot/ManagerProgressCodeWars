    "description": "This kata is part two of precise fractions series (see pt. 1: http://www.codewars.com/kata/precise-fractions-pt-1-basics).\n\nThis time, all we need is methods for converting fractions from common to decimal and vice versa.\n\nYour goal is to implement class ```Fraction``` with two static methods:\n\n - ```toDecimal(fraction)``` - takes string with common fraction representation and returns decimal representation of the same value,\n - ```fromDecimal(fraction)``` - does the opposite. Must return common fraction in normalised form (e.g. ```2/4``` would be shortened to ```1/2```).\n \nIn both cases, common fractions always will have form:\n\n```[ WHOLES ] [ NUMERATOR / DENOMINATOR ]```\n\nwhich means, both wholes and fractional part will be present only if needed, and if both are present, they will be separated by a single space character; eg.:\n\n```\n1\n1/2\n1 1/2\n```\n\nIn both cases, decimal fractions always will have form:\n\n```WHOLES [ . [ DECIMAL ] [ ( REPEATING ) ] ]```\n\nwhich means that decimal part is present only if needed, and if there is repeating part of the decimal part, it will be enclosed in parentheses; eg.:\n\n```\n1\n1.5\n0.(3)\n0.123(4)\n```\n\nThe conversion is the main goal here, so there will be no \"tricky\" input, such as invalid strings, non-string value, or even negative numbers - just don't worry about such validation.",
