    "description": "Dave thinks he's come up with a Roulette bet that pays out in his favour in the long run.\n\nDave's an idiot.\n\nProve that Dave is an idiot by writing the RouletteBet class, which acts as a hash with the following keys:\n```\n:total_bet => The total amount bet (Will always be a whole number for simplicity)\n:max_profit => The maximum profit that could be won from the spin (maximum win - total bet)\n:odds_of_max_profit => The % chance of winning the maximum profit (A float rounded to 2 places)\n:odds_of_winning => The % chance of hitting (A float rounded to 2 places)\n:average_profit => The average profit returned from the bet (hint: this should always be negative, proving Dave wrong)\n```\nAssumptions you can make for this kata:\n```\nThe wheel has a total of 37 numbers, 0-36, with an equal chance of hitting each number\nThe bet will always be a whole number (integer) on each number\nThe payout for hitting a winning number is 35/1 (equal to 36 times the bet)\nBoth the keys and values for the 'bet' hash will be integers\nThe hash will never be empty and the values will always be 1 or more\n```\n\nThe bet will be passed as a hash in the following format:\n```{number=>bet_amount, number=>bet_amount}```\n\nFor example,\n```ruby\nrb = RouletteBet.new({0=>5}) # A bet of 5 coins/chips/dollars on the number 0\nrb[:total_bet] => 5\nrb[:max_profit] => 175 # 180 maximum win minus the 5 bet\nrb[:odds_of_winning] => 2.7 # 2.7% chance of hitting a winning number (rounded)\nrb[:odds_of_max_profit] => 2.7 # 2.7% chance of hitting the maximum profit (rounded)\nrb[:average_profit] => -0.14 # Rounded to 2 places\n```\nDave's 'fool proof' bet that 'always' wins in the long run:\n```ruby\nrb = RouletteBet.new({1=>1, 3=>1, 5=>1, 7=>1, 9=>1, 12=>1, 14=>1, 16=>1, \n18=>1, 19=>1, 21=>1, 23=>2, 25=>1, 27=>1, 30=>2, 32=>1, 34=>1, 36=>1}) # A total bet of 20, covering 18 numbers\nrb[:total_bet] => 20\nrb[:max_profit] => 52\nrb[:odds_of_winning] => 48.65 # 48.65% chance of hitting a winning number, rounded to 2 places\nrb[:odds_of_max_profit] => 5.41 # 5.41% chance of winning the maximum profit, rounded to 2 places\nrb[:average_profit] => -0.54 # Rounded to 2 places\n```\n",
