    "description": "Cryptic Sue\n=============\n\nSue loves to send words in a cryptic fashion. Can you decode the message that she has sent. \n\nExample cryptic message\n-----------------------\n\n        reVert([13,15,\"O\",10,9,\"L\",11,12,\"L\",5,3,\"H\",4,6,\"E\",11], 3)   ===>  'HELLO';\n\n## Clues\n\n### Sue has hidden her word in an array ......which includes:     \n- Unordered letters - these letters form the word\n- Numbers - random numbers as well as not so random numbers \n\n-------------\n\n### Not all numbers are random! \nSue loves times tables and she will specify which table she is using as the second parameter, which means that those numbers in the array are important! Make sure you don't remove them :) - Any other number is a red herring and needs to be removed.\n\n-----------\n### What next\nOnce you have removed all the red herrings, the other numbers left in the array correspond to the order that the letters need to be arranged into to make the word - Find a way to decode the message from the numbers left. \n\n-------\n### Return \nReturn the word back as string when you have decoded her message. \n\n--------------------\nHelpful Hints:\n\n- *Assume the array will always contain letters and numbers. Sue will not pass you an empty array* \n\n- *Important numbers will not be repeated in the array* \n\n--------\n### Sue may use any times table to encrypt her message. \n",
