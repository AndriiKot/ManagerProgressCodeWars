    "description": "It's a normal day at your school. You currently have geography and are trying so hard not to fall asleep. You gaze around for some entertainment.\nYou see your classmates Cassandra and her Greek friend Alexios send notes to each other during the entire lesson. At one point, you see Cassandra looking\nat you, she smiles and looks away. She immediately writes a note and sends it to Alexios. You wonder just what she could have written there. Is she making\nfun of you? Are you having a bad hair day? Did she notice you farted? You HAVE to find out!\n\nWhen the lesson finishes you see Cassandra and Alexios throw their notes into the trash bin. You wait for them to leave and hurrily grab those notes.\nLucky break, right? Not so fast. They seem to be writing in Greek letters, but wait a second. There's no way Cassandra knows Greek. What's going on?\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nYou have a *note* (string) with characters that have a hidden meaning. You need to figure out this meaning.\n\nExample:\n\n``` 'Wηατεωερ ψοθλδ τηισ μεαν?'  ---> 'Whatever could this mean?' ```",
