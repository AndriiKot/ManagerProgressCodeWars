    "description": "# The Zemour's Algorithm\n\nAs you might know, Eric Zemour wants to make a person's name a bit more French. Your mission here is to create a function that takes a person's name and returns their French name.\n\nYou will need to take the closest name from the calendar that you can find [here](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendrier_des_saints_en_France). It is pre-loaded in the kata as NAMES.\n\nThe closest name will be the name in alphabetical order that follows the stranger's name.\n\n# Exceptions\n\nDo not take the first two name of January (Marie mère de Dieu Basile de Césarée et Grégoire de Nazianze)\n\nThe algorithm doesn't consider the gender.\n\nThe algorithm doesn't contain the name Victor (Victor Hugo) because his political ideas were not the same as Zemour\n",
