    "description": "# Task\nWrite function `read_file` that takes a `csv file name` in `str` format as an argument and returns `dictionary` with correct `key: value` pairs. File will have 2 columns `name` and `language` - in returned dictionary, `key` should be `name` column and `value` should be `language` column. See examples and / or sample test for clarity.\n\n`sample.csv` will be preloaded for you, other files in fixed and random test will be created by test, when test is running. Try to run all tests for clarity.\n\nThis is simple version, no tricks. File will always exist. It will always be `.csv` file as well. \n\n\n## Example\n`sample.csv`\n```\n|name   |language |\n|-------|---------|\n|Zoey   |python   |\n\n```\nexpected outcome:\n```\n{\"Zoey\": \"python\"}\n```\n\n## Hint\nYou may consider using python `csv` module. \n\n## File kata serie\n\n1.
