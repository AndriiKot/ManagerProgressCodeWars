    "description": "Write a function that receives an array of speed camera timestamps and returns the speed of the detected object in miles per hour\n\nA LIDAR speed camera operates by sending out a laser beam and timing how long it takes for the laser to bounce off the vehicle and return. After a small delay the laser is resent. Using both pairs of sending and receiving timestamps it is possible to calculate the speed of the object\n\nConstants to use:\n- Light travels at 30cm per ns (nanosecond)\n- A nanosecond is one billionth of a second (1⁄1,000,000,000 of a second or 1e-9)\n- A mile is 1.609 kilometers\n\nThe 4 element array parameter is defined as:\n\n- [0] timeStamp1stLaserSent,\n- [1] timeStamp1stLaserReturned,\n- [2] timeStamp2ndLaserSent,\n- [3] timeStamp2ndLaserReturned\n\nAll timestamps are in nanoseconds\n\nThe speed camera is fixed in place and detects objects that have passed it and are moving away from it\n\nFor an extra (optional) challenge, the solution is possible in Javascript in 50 characters (maybe less)",
