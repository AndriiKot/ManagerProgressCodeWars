    "description": "WORLD RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP SCHEDULE:</br>\nDay1 (Friday): `Stage1: Asphalt = 38km, Stage2: Gravel = 79km, Stage3: Snow = 64km`.</br>\nDay2 (Suturday): `Super Stage: TBA`.\n\nRUNNING ORDER and WINNER:</br>\nDuring the first day pilots are driving individually, stage times are being totalled.</br>\nIn Super Stage pilots are driving simultaneously, but going into course based on the handicap they have saved the previous day. Winner is decided whoever croses the finish line in Super Stage first.\n\nCARS and their AVERAGE SPEEDS on Asphalt, Gravel and Snow, respectively:</br>\nToyota Yaris (without turbo installed) - `165kph, 139kph, 121kph`.</br>\nHyundai I20 (with turbo installed) - `194kph, 153kph, 130kph`.\n\nYOUR TASK:\nReturn the winner (`\"Toyota\"` or `\"Hyundai\"`) and winner's split time over the other car as `\"MM:SS\"` (see test cases), based on Toyota's turbo's choice and the surface and length of Super Stage (given as an arguments). Turbo boost values range `from 1 to 25` and means equal percentage increase in speeds (rounded after increasing) in all three surfaces (`\"Asphalt\"`, `\"Gravel\"` and `\"Snow\"`). Length values range `from 1 to 100` (km).\n\nYou must assume Hyundai I20 will perform exactly on the average speeds noted above throughout the whole course and there will only be one surface in Super Stage. Finally, if there happens to be a tie (you'll be tested for it), return `\"Toyota = Hyundai\"`;\n\nMETRIC SYSTEM ONLY! Seconds must be rounded after each stage.\n\n\n \n",
