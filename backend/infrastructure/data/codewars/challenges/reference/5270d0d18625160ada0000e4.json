    "description": "Greed is a dice game played with five six-sided dice. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to score a throw according to these rules. You will always be given an array with five six-sided dice values.\n\n``` \n Three 1's => 1000 points\n Three 6's =>  600 points\n Three 5's =>  500 points\n Three 4's =>  400 points\n Three 3's =>  300 points\n Three 2's =>  200 points\n One   1   =>  100 points\n One   5   =>   50 point\n```\n\nEach of 5 dice can only be counted once in each roll. For example, a given \"5\" can only count as part of a \ntriplet (contributing to the 500 points) or as a single 50 points, but not both in the same roll.\n\nExample scoring\n\n```\n Throw       Score\n ---------   ------------------\n 5 1 3 4 1   250:  50 (for the 5) + 2 * 100 (for the 1s)\n 1 1 1 3 1   1100: 1000 (for three 1s) + 100 (for the other 1)\n 2 4 4 5 4   450:  400 (for three 4s) + 50 (for the 5)\n```\n\n~~~if:python\nNote: your solution must not modify the input list.\n~~~\n~~~if:coffeescript,csharp,java,javascript,kotlin,lua,php,ruby,typescript\nNote: your solution must not modify the input array.\n~~~\n~~~if:lua\nNote: your solution must not modify the input table.\n~~~\n",
