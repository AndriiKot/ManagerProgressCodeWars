All the did was change the order in which www. and .com appear.\n\nTime for you to show off your programming skills to the other agents by automating the assembly of the web address.\n\nGiven a string  ```string```, return a proper web address.\n\n<h1>Notes: \n\n<li> All letters in the string will be used in the web address\n<li> If you are given an empty string, return it.\n<li> All strings will be valid scrambled web addresses if not empty\n\n<h1>Example:\n\n```\nstring = 'dogs.comwww.'\n\nShould return www.dogs.com\n\nstring = .comwww.codewars\n\nShould return www.codewars.com\n\n```\n",
