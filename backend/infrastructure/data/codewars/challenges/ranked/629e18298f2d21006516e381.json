  "description": "## Overview\n\nWe are going to be studying permutations of `n` distinct elements - for simplicity we shall use the integers from `1` to `n`.\n\nIf we start with the integers `1` to `n` in ascending order in a list:\n\n`[1, 2, 3, ..., n-2, n-1, n]`\n\nthen, for a given value of `n`, how many permutations of this list are there in which each element's index changes by **AT MOST** 1 after the permutation?\n\n---\n\n## Inputs\n\nYou will be given an `integer`, `n`, representing the number of distinct elements that we want to permute. \n\nAs mentioned, for definiteness, you can think of the integers from `1` to `n` in a starting list given by `[1, 2, ..., n]`\n\n**Performance requirement:** Values from `0` up to `200` may be tested.\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n**In Lambda Calculus**, values up to `75` may be tested.\n~~~\n\n## Output\n\nYou must return an `integer` representing the total number of possible permutations of the list `[1, 2, ..., n]` that satisfy the requirement.\n\n## Important notes\n\n1. The identity permutation, where no element changes its index, is a valid permutation according to the definition, so make sure you include it in your total.\n2. You **cannot** wrap-around the list, so changing element `1` with element `n` is **not allowed** (except for the case `n = 2` of course).\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n## Encodings\n\npurity: `LetRec`  \nnumEncoding: `BinaryScott`  \n~~~\n\n---\n\n## Walk-through Example\n\nLet's consider the case `n = 4`; so concretely we are looking at permutations of the list `[1,2,3,4]`\n\nThere are in total `n! = 4! = 24` possible permutations of this list. \n\nIf you write out all of these 24 possible permutations, you will find that only `5` satisfy the above requirement:\n\n`[1,2,3,4]` - no element changes index.\n\n`[2,1,3,4]` - elements 1&2 change indices by +1 and -1 respectively.\n\n`[1,3,2,4]` - elements 2&3 change indices by +1 and -1 respectively.\n\n`[1,2,4,3]` - elements 3&4 change indices by +1 and -1 respectively.\n\n`[2,1,4,3]` - elements 1&2 change indices by +1 and -1 respectively **and** elements 3&4 change indices by +1 and -1 respectively.\n\nIn all of the `5` above permutations, the elements' indices have indeed changed by at most 1.\n\nSo for the input `n = 4` you should return the answer `5`.\n\n**Explanation of an INVALID permutation for n = 4**\n\nTo be clear, let's consider another permutation which **does not** satisfy the kata's requirement, and therefore should not be included in your total:\n\n`[3,4,2,1]` - element 1 has changed index by +3, element 2 by +1, element 3 by -2, element 4 by -2.\n\nThe above permutation is therefore **not** allowed, since at least one element has changed index by **more than** 1.",
