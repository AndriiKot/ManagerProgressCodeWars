  "description": "# Bolzano's theorem\n\n## Description\n\nIn this kata, you will have to use the Bolzano's theorem to find a root of a function. First of all, let's define what the Bolzano's theorem is. \n\nWhen we have a continuous function `$f(x)$` in an interval `$[a, b]$` and `$f(a) \\cdot f(b) \\lt 0$` (`$f(a)$` and `$f(b)$` have different sign), Bolzano's theorem says that it exists a number `$c \\in (a, b)$` so that `$c$` is a root of the function `$f(x)$` (`$f(c) = 0$`).\n\nIf you need more information, visit this [Superprof page](https://www.superprof.co.uk/resources/academic/maths/calculus/limits/bolzanos-theorem.html) about the Bolzano's thorem.\n\n## Your task\n\nYou have to write a function called `bolzanos_theorem`, that will receive the following parameters:\n\n- `function`: the function you have to evaluate. It will be like `x**2 - 1`, where `x` is the parameter to solve for.\n- `solution_interval`: the interval where the root we are looking for is contained.\n- `decimals`: the number of decimals your solution must have.\n\nIMPORTANT: We are looking for truncated roots, as they will be irrational.",
