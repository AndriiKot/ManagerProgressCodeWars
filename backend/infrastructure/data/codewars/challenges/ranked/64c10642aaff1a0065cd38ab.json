  "description": "Codewars allows for markdown formatting, meaning that it's possible to format words by surrounding text with special characters. For example, to get **bold** text, you surround the text with double asterisks, like this `**bold**`.\n\nHere is a list of the possible formatting options in Codewars and how to apply them:\n- `**bold**`\n- `_italics_`\n- `` `inline code` ``\n- `~~strikethrough~~`\n\n### Challenge\nGiven a list of `words` and a `styles`, return the newly formatted string. *Style characters* are single letters that represent the different types of formatting. \n\nFor the purposes of this challenge, the style characters are as follows:\n- `\"b\"` is for **bold**\n- `\"i\"` is for  _italics_\n- `\"c\"` is for `inline code`\n- `\"s\"` is for ~~strikethrough~~\n\n### Examples\n```\ncw_format([\"Bold\", \"Italics\"], [\"b\", \"i\"]) ➞ \"**Bold**\\n_Italics_\"\n\ncw_format([\"Code\", \"Ruby\", \"JavaScript\"],[\"c\", \"s\", \"b\"]) ➞ \"`Code`\\n~~Ruby~~\\n**JavaScript**\"\n\ncw_format([\"That's a strike!\"], [\"s\"]) ➞ \"~~That's a strike!~~\"\n```\n\n### Notes\nRemember to format your comments!",
