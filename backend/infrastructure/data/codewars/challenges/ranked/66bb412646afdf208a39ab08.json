  "description": "In a circular sector with a central angle of α degrees, two circles are involved:\n\n1. A larger circle with radius R that defines the sector.\n\n2. A smaller circle that is inscribed within the sector, touching both radi iand the arc of the sector.\n\nYour task is to compute the area of the shaded region, which is the part of the sector that lies outside the inscribed smaller circle.\n\nProblem Description:\nGiven the radius R of the sector and the central angle 𝛼 (in degrees), find the area of the shaded region between the sector and the inscribed circle.\n\n\nInputs:\n1. An integer 𝑅 (1 ≤ 𝑅 ≤ 10^5): The radius of the sector.\n\n2. A float α (0 < 𝛼 < 180): The central angle of the sector in degrees.\n\nOutputs:\n1. A float representing the area of the shaded region, rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Minimum Value of α is greater than 0 (to ensure a valid sector).\n2. Maximum Value of α is less than 180 degrees.\n\n\n![Description image](https://i.imgur.com/9iCYNKs.png)\n",
