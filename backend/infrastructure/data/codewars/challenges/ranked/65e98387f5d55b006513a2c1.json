  "description": "# Task\n\nGiven two linear equations, determine whether they have one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions.\n\n**Inputs:**\n\n1) ```eq1``` : First linear equation -> string\n2) ```eq2``` : Second linear equation -> string\n\n**Output:**\n\n- If the linear equations have one solution, return \"One solution\"\n\n- If the linear equations have infintely many solutions, return \"Infinitely many solutions\"\n\n- If the linear equations have no solution, return \"No solution\"\n\n# Notes\n\n- The equations given will always be in the following form: `$ax + by = c$`\n\n- 'a','b', and 'c' can all be negative and will be expressed as such: `$-ax + (-by) = -c$`\n\n- 'a', 'b', and 'c' will all be integers",
