  "description": "Lockpicking is one of the fundamentals for a burglar. Show us how it is possible to open a WeakChest without knowing its secret code.\n\nThis is the interface of WeakChest:\n\n```\npublic final class WeakChest {\n  // Returns true if the chest is open\n  public boolean isOpen()\n  \n  // Creates a chest\n  public WeakChest()\n  \n  // Opens the chest with an int code between 0 and 999\n  public void openChest(int inputCode)\n    throws BadCodeException\n  \n```\nAs you see, a WeakChest can be opened with a specific integer code between 0 and 999. Once open, the chest will stay open.\n\nYour task is to complete the Burglar's `lockpick()` function:\n- open the chest passed in input\n- return it\n\n\n",
