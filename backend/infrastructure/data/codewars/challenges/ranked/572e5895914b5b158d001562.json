  "description": "## Story\n\nI think most of you heard about delegates in C#. Today we need to create our own delegate in JS. Some may think that it's hard, some that it isn't. But this Kata will give you experience in JS programming.\n\n## What is needed? OR PLAN!\n\n### 1. create add method\n\nFirst of all you need to fill with your code `add` method.\n\nIt need to:\n\n1. Throw error if argument is not a function\n2. Throw error if functio already exists\n3. Compare number of parameters and throw Error if count of parameters not equal to delegate's parameters\n4. Add to list of functions\n\n### 2. create main method\n\nThen you need to create main method.\n\nIt need to:\n\n1. Compare parameters count\n2. Compare types of parameters with initialization types\n3. Execute all functions\n\n### 3. create anything else\n\n### Description\n\nYour delegate will receive variable amount of ***types*** as `string`\n\nYou can get type of variable using preloaded function `GetType( obj )`\n\nAlso all types that you need are preloaded. You can see list of types below:\n\n```javascript\n// BASIC TYPES\nTYPE_BOOL = GetType( true );\nTYPE_NUMBER = GetType( 0 );\nTYPE_STRING = GetType( '' );\n// COMPLEX TYPES\nTYPE_OBJECT = GetType( {} );\nTYPE_FUNCTION = GetType( function() {} );\nTYPE_ARRAY  = GetType( [] );\n```\n\n### Now you know what you need to do. Let's begin the Kata!",
