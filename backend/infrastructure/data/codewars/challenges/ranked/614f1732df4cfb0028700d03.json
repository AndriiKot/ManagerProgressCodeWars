  "description": "# Narrative\n\nYour task is to create brain for amoeba. You're lucky because this creature doesn't think a lot - all what it wants is food.\n\n```\n~*                                         ::\n```\n\nYour fellow amoeba floats in 2D primordial soup that looks like a maze. It has no eyes, so it can't see the whole maze, but it have sense of smell that helps it to know how far from food it is.\n\n```\n            ||  ||\n            ||  ||\n        ||||||  ||||||\n              ~* \"sniff\"\n        ||||||  ||||||\n            ||  ||\n            ||  ||\n```\n\nAmoeba needs to hurry, because it could starve to death if it will take too long to get to food.\n\n# Task\n\nYour task is to implement navigation logic from random point in maze to point with food. Navigation logic must be implemented in get_move_direction() method of AmoebaBrain class.\n\nNotes on maze:\n* Size and structure of maze will be random.\n* Method get_move_direction() will be called (size_of_maze**1.7 + size_of_maze) times, and if amoeba won't get to food at last call - it will die. I ran thousands of simulations - this value of iterations will cover worst case scenario for optimal algorithm.\n\nget_move_direction() has two parameters: surrounding and food_smell.\n\n* surrounding -- list of lists with bool values, that shows possible move directions without obstacles.\n\nThis is how it could look:\n\n```python\nsurrounding = [\n[False, False, False],\n[True, False, True],\n[False, True, False]]\n```\n\nFrom this surrounding amoeba could understand that directions left (-1, 0), down (0, -1) and right (1, 0) are possible. Central \"direction\" (direction[1][1]) is always False.\n\n* food_smell -- float value in range [0, 1] that shows how far amoeba is from food: 0 - farthest point from food, 1 - food.\n\nFood smell doesn't work through walls, and shows shortest path to the food - if amoeba will go in directions with increasing values, it will find food.\n\n* get_move_direction() returns tuple of two integer values in range of [-1, 1], that represents x and y direction where amoeba will try to move. Y axis directed up, X axis directed right - (-1, 1) is left-up (west-north) direction.\n\nIf amoeba will try to go through wall - it will just remain on the same place (you will see print in logs if this situation occurs).\n\n# Help in debugging\n\nIn test cases you could use additional parameters \"size_of_maze\" and \"show_maze_iterations\" for functions:\n\n```python\ndef test_amoeba_brain(amoeba_brain, maze=None, size_of_maze_to_generate=None,\n                      show_debug=False, iterations_limit=None):\n  ...\n```\n\n* amoeba_brain - AmoebaBrain class to test.\n* maze - custom maze. It's list of lists with values in range [0, 3]: 0 - empty, 1, wall, 2 - amoeba, 3 - food. There is example in sample test.\n* size_of_maze_to_generate - size of maze, must be in range [3, 50]. You could use this parameter if you want to test your amoeba in some random maze with given size.\n* show_debug - toggles debug print of all maze traversal iterations.\n* iterations_limit - you could set this parameter if you want to check only several iterations of simulation (to reduce log size when show_debug is on).\n* return value - is this amoeba found it's food?\n\nOnly one of parameters \"maze\" or \"size_of_maze_to_generate\" could be specified at one time. \n\nLegend for debug print:\n\n* ~* - amoeba\n* :: - food\n* || - wall\n* number - smell value of empty space\n\nExample of one iteration debug:\n\n```\n::::::::::::::ITERATION 0/20::::::::::::::\n~~~~~~~~BEFORE MOVE~~~~~~~~\n:: || 16 22 28 \n94 || || || 34 \n88 82 76 || 40 \n|| || 70 || 46 \n52 58 64 58 ~* \n~~~~get_move_direction()~~~~\n~~~~~~~~AFTER MOVE~~~~~~~~~\n:: || 16 22 28 \n94 || || || 34 \n88 82 76 || 40 \n|| || 70 || ~* \n52 58 64 58 52 \n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n```\n\nIf your amoeba will die, you will receive postmortem log like this, to figure out what's wrong:\n\n```\nAmoeba died from starvation :c\n~~~~~~HELP IN DEBUGGING~~~~~~\nYou've reached maximum amount of iterations: 20\nHere is how maze looked like at start:\n52 58 64 || :: \n46 || 70 || 94 \n40 || 76 82 88 \n34 || || || || \n~* 22 16 10 04 \nHere is how it looks at the end:\n52 58 64 || :: \n46 || 70 || 94 \n40 || 76 82 88 \n34 || || || || \n~* 22 16 10 04 \nYou could debug this maze by putting following list in \"maze\" parameter in test_amoeba_brain():\n[[0, 0, 0, 1, 3], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nP.S.: I'm new in Kata's creation, so please leave feedback - I want to get better at it.
