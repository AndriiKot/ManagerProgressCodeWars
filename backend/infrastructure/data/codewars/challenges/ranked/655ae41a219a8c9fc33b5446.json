  "description": "# Find years with five fifth Sundays\nEvery year there are four or five months that have five Sundays. Many churches will have special events on those fifth Sundays.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a function that when given a year, returns true if that year has five months with a fith Sunday and false if it only has four.\n\n## Examples\n2023 has five months with a fifth Sunday and therefore returns true:\n- hasFiveSundays(2023) -> true\n\n2022 has four months with a fifth Sunday and should return false:\n- hasFiveSundays(2022) -> false\n\nGood luck!",
