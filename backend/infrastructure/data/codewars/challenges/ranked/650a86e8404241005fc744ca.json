  "description": "Your task is to implement a function that examines a given string composed of binary digits (0s and 1s). The function should return `True` if:\n\n- Every consecutive sequence of ones is immediately followed by an equal-length consecutive sequence of zeroes, and the number of ones is equal to the number of zeroes.\n\n- A leading zero always results in a `False` outcome.\n\nHere are some examples to illustrate the expected behavior of the function:\n**Examples**\n```\n- For the input \"110011100010,\" the function should return True because every consecutive sequence of ones (e.g., \"11,\" \"111,\" \"1\") is followed by an equal-length consecutive sequence of zeroes.\n\n- For the input \"101010110,\" the function should return False because the sequence of ones (\"11\") is not followed by an equal-length consecutive sequence of zeroes.\n\n- \"111100001100\" # True \n\n- \"111\" # False\n\n- \"00110100001111 # False, although the number of zeroes and ones is equal, \nthe consecutive sequence of ones (e.g., \"11,\" \"1,\" \"1111\") is not followed \nby an equal-length consecutive sequence of zeroes.\n```\n**Notes**\n\n- The input string will only contain digits `0` or `1`.\n- The length of the input string (`txt`) will be greater than zero.",
