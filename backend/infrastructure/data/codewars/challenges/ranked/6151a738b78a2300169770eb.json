  "description": "Take a number `NUMBER-1` and return sum of `1` to `NUMBER-1`.\n\nlowest number tested is 0\n\n# Note :\n\nAny help is appreciated in improving the random test suite \n\n# IMPORTANT (MUST READ): \n\nMostly copied from discord discussions :\n\nCurrently Cobol katas dont have random test cases and therefore can't be placed as translations due to said issues.\n\nso there was only 1 kata (a lvl 8 with no random tests and 200 fixed tests, that was likely a duplicate) and 2 translations (both having 10 copy pasted tests that had random vals in them, but not much)\n\nThis kata is here mostly to debug the random test suite (alternately check if its possible at all to begin with for all vals).\n\nOnce fixed, the kata will be retired.\n\nAs it stands there are way too many things that can and probably need to be updated in tests\n\n",
