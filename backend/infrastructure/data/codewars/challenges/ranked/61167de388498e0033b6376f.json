  "description": "It's Athens, Greece 447 BC and Statesman Percules has been commissioned to build the Parthenon. He has appointed your buddies Ictinus and Callicrates as the lead archetects but they need your help.\n\n*Ictinus - \"Percules' mind changes more than the heart of Posiedon!\"*\n\n*Callicrates - \"Our specs have the will of Artemis!\"*\n\nThe frustrated archetects elaborate that the dimensions keep changing.\n\n*Ictinus - \"He continually worries about angering Helios.\"*\n\n*Callicrates - \"But it still needs to be seen from Mt. Olympus.\"*\n\nTo help your buddies, create a formula to calculate each height division of the Parthenon.\n\n**The dimensions need to be proportionate to how the Parthenon would look if the length and height represented by an approximation of the golden ratio 13/8 (close to how it was actually was built).**\n\nEach division ordered from smallest to largest is beamBottom, beamTop, roof, pillars. If you get stuck find a picture of the original Parthenon.\n\nINPUT - height (in metres).\n\nOUTPUT - An array representing [roof, beamTop, beamBottom, pillars].\n\n(*beamTop and beamBottom are just different sections of the same beam.*)\n",
