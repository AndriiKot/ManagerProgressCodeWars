  "description": "You are given:\n* `i`, the interval. (`i` >= 1). `i` is read as a single char.\n* `a`, a string. `a` is terminated with `\\0`.\n\nFor every `i`-th character of `a`, append a `\\x01` character.\n\nYour solution will be tested against every interval from 1 to 255, with multiple randomly generated strings per interval, some short and some long. Make sure your code is at least somewhat efficient so that it has no trouble doing all that in under 12 seconds.",
