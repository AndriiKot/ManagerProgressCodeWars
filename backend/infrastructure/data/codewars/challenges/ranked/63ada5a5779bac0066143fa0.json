Earth resources are scarcer than ever before. If humanity wants to survive, we need to migrate to outer space. UCA, a corporation specialized in planetary drilling, hired me to scout for a field expert.\n\nWe have several forward bases on the Moon. Reconnaissance teams have recently reported promising locations for building settlements on the lunar surface. These sites offer potential shelter from extreme temperature fluctuations and harmful radiation, but we need to understand the terrain better. Our drills are already in place, but we need more data before we can give a go to start the drilling operation.\n\n*UCA Engineers' Technical Report: \"Operation Artemis Drill\"*\n> We need precise analysis of lunar soil composition and density. The Moon's regolith varies significantly across different regions, with bulk densities ranging from 1.2387 g/cm³ to 1.5 g/cm³. Understanding these variations is crucial for construction stability and resource extraction. For instance, certain minerals in lunar soil could be used to produce oxygen or construction materials, making some areas more valuable than others for long-term settlement.\n\nBy accurately mapping the lunar subsurface, we can identify the most suitable locations for sustainable habitats and resource production facilities. The success of this mission could determine the future of human civilization.\n\nThis is where you, our field expert, come into play...\n\n</details>\n\n<details open>\n  <summary style=\"\n    padding: 3px;\n    width: 100%;\n    border: none;\n    font-size: 18px;\n    box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px #bbbbbb; \n    cursor: pointer;\">\n  Task</summary>\n\n##### \"Given a satellite image of the surface of the Moon showing a possible location for building a settlement, with our drills already in place, calculate how long it will take to complete the drilling operation.\"\n\n```\nSatellite image from archive:\n\n´`:->>....xxxx..****..****..****.XX.\n´`:===>...xxxx..****..****..****.@@.\n´`:->>....xxxx..****..****..****.XX.\n\n```\n\n### Input\n\n- canvas: a string, representing a satellite image of the surface of the Moon.
