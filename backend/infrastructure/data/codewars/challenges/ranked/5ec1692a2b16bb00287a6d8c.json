  "description": "# Description\nYou get a list that contains points. A \"point\" is a tuple like `(x, y)`, where `x` and `y` are integer coordinates. By connecting three points, you get a triangle. There will be `n > 2` points in the list, so you can draw one or more triangles through them.\n\nYour task is to write a program that returns a tuple containing the areas of the largest and smallest triangles, which could be formed by these points.\n\n\n### Example:\nPoints `(-4, 5), (-4, 0), (2, 3), (6, 0)` can formate 4 different triangles with following areas:\n\n![tri1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/x1bzqbV0/Triangles.png)\n\nThe largest area is __25__ and the smallest is __5__. So the correct return value is `(25, 5)`\n\n### Additional information:\n- In the returned tuple, the first position should be the largest area, and the second is the smallest.\n- Areas should be rounded to tenths.\n- You will always get at least __3__ points.\n- If the points create only one triangle or several with the same areas, the returned tuple shoud look like this: `(10, 10)`\n- Make your program efficient. With 5 points, you can make 60 triangles, but only 10 of them will be different.\n- Three points can form a straight line. This doesn't count as a triangle!\n- Use Google!",
