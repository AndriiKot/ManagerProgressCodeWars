  "description": "Today you are Ethan Hunt, and you won't be happy about it because you were just kidnapped and left unconscious. When you wake up you find yourself hands tied inside a van. As soon as you free yourself you realize there is a very big bomb next to you.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to defuse the bomb using a secret **password** before it's to late and explodes.\n\nYou manage to contact your friend Benji so he can help you.\n<br /><br />\n\n# Task\nYou are given a **hashed password**, for example: \n```python \n\"8fa66791564054ff7a5d8226c059de4c579d4109540a2d7ff715f8d829873ec5\"\n```\nAnd you must dehash it somehow... Twice. \nBenji tells you that the original password was hashed with `sha256` algorithm and then hashed again (same algorithm).\n\nThe result of the previos **hash** should be:\n```python \nwinner\n```\nOnce you get the **original password** return it.\n\n**Note.** The solution must be `<= 1000 bytes`\n\n# Example\n```python \n# Given hash -> 68294cf2dcf09372f59e46bacf9e4fa2dc0822c0ed8d45b0b351f83789625b06\ndefuse_the_bomb(password_hash) # Must return \"banana\"\n# Password -> banana\n# First hash -> b493d48364afe44d11c0165cf470a4164d1e2609911ef998be868d46ade3de4e\n# Second hash -> 68294cf2dcf09372f59e46bacf9e4fa2dc0822c0ed8d45b0b351f83789625b06\n```\n\n## Tips\nYour good friend Benji calls you on the last moment and tells you that the **password** to defuse the bomb was last seen on the file [wordlist-skipfish.fuzz.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Miscellaneous/wordlist-skipfish.fuzz.txt)\n\nGood luck.",
