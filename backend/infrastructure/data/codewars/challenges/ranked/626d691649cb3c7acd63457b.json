  "description": "You are a big fan of Formula 1.\n\nThere was a race last week-end, but ... you missed the live TV.\nYou picked on the internet a list of the **events** during the race, and you want to get your champion's rank at the end of the race.\n\nAn event is a pilot ID followed by a type. There are two types of events:\n<ul><li>'O' : a pilot is overtaking the one just in front of him</li>\n<li>'I' : a pilot had an incident... and is forced to quit the race (and subsequently all pilots after this one gain one rank)</li></ul>\n\nThe list of events is passed as a string where events are separated with a space, first event first. \n_e.g: \"2 O 12 I\" means the pilot#2 overtook, then the pilot#12 had an incident._\n\nYour function will return the rank of your champion at the end of the race, given your champion's ID (as int) and the list of events. Return -1 if your champion had an incident.\n\nNOTES:\n<ul><li>there are 20 positions when the race starts (from 1 to 20, 1 being the one in front),</li>\n<li>therefore, the <strong>rank</strong> of a pilot, at start and during the race, is actually his/her <strong>position</strong> (first pilot at position 1, etc...),</li>\n<li>each pilot ID is his position when the races starts,</li>\n<li>all events in entry lists are syntactically valid.</li>\n</ul>\n\n_Final tests contains about 20 fixed events, and 100 random tests with race length between 10 to 30 events.\nIn the tests (fixed and random): the leading pilot never overtakes, and after having an incident, the pilot never appears in further events._\n\n**Enjoy !**\n\n_Thanks to the **Best french developer Contest** 2019_  \n",
