  "description": "A **hexagonal grid** is a commonly used **game board design** based on hexagonal tiling. In the following grid, the two marked locations have a minimum distance of 6 because at least 6 steps are needed to reach the second location starting from the first one.\n\n![xx](https://i.imgur.com/MhsqNkt.png)\n\nWrite a function that takes a hexagonal grid with two marked locations as input and returns their distance.\n\nThe input grid will be a list of strings in which each tile is represented with `o` and the two marked locations with `x`.\n\n### Examples\n```\nhexDistance([\n  \"  o o  \",\n  \" o x o \",\n  \"  o x  \",\n]) ➞ 1\n\nhexDistance([\n  \"  o o  \",\n  \" x o o \",\n  \"  o x  \",\n]) ➞ 2\n\nhexDistance([\n  \"   o o o   \",\n  \"  o o o o  \",\n  \" o o o o o \",\n  \"  x o o x  \",\n  \"   o o o   \",\n]) ➞ 3\n\nhexDistance([\n  \"  o x  \",\n  \" o o o \",\n  \"o o x o\",\n  \" o o o \",\n  \"  o o  \"\n]) ➞ 2  \n\nhexDistance([\n  \"  o x  \",\n  \" o o o \",\n  \"o o o o\",\n  \" o o o \",\n  \"  x o  \"\n]) ➞ 4  \n```",
