Like this:\n \n ```\n arr = [5,6,7,6,7,6,5,4,3,2,3,4,5]\n ```\n Given two numbers `nth` and `number`, your task is find the index of `n`th `number`. For example:\n \n ```\n arr = [5,6,7,6,7,6,5,4,3,2,3,4,5]\n \n findIndexOf(arr, 1, 5) === 0  //nth = 1, number = 5\n \n findIndexOf(arr, 2, 5) === 6  //nth = 2, number = 5\n \n findIndexOf(arr, 3, 5) === 12 //nth = 3, number = 5\n \n findIndexOf(arr, 1, 3) === 8 //nth = 1, number = 3\n \n ```\n If `nth` less than 1 or `nth` more than the count of numbers or `number` is not found in `arr`, return `null`.\n \n ```\n arr = [5,6,7,6,7,6,5,4,3,2,3,4,5]\n \n findIndexOf(arr, 0, 5) === null //nth is starting from 1\n \n findIndexOf(arr, -1, 5) === null //nth is starting from 1\n \n findIndexOf(arr, 4, 5) === null //number 5 only appear 3 times in arr\n \n findIndexOf(arr, 1, 10) === null //arr doesn't contains number 10\n \n ```\n \n \n# Note:\n - Arguments `arr` always be an array that contains at least 5 elements; All elements are positive integers;\n - Arguments `nth` always be an integer(negative, positive or 0);\n - Arguments `number` always be an positive integer;\n - Please pay attention to optimizing the code to avoid time out.\n - In the performance test(10000000 elements x 100 testcases), the time consuming of each test case should be within 6ms. This means, Your algorithm should be faster than O(n), your code should run as fast as a rocket ;-) \n",
