  "description": "vowels = \"aeiou\"\n\nInput: is only a single word.\n\nThe goal of this kata is to separate all the syllables with '-' and return the separated string.\n\nTo separate syllables there are 2 rules:\n\n```\nThe rule is you should add '-' next to the consonant where the consonant is the next of a vowel character.\n  \n  'abort' - > 'ab-or-t',\n  \n  'baby' - > 'bab-y',\n  \n  'einstein' - > 'ein-stein'\n  \n```\n\n```\nAnother rule is if there are no next letter to the last syllable you should not add '-':\n\n  'bob' -> 'bob'\n  \n```\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n```\nExample:\n\nInput: \"balloon\"\n\nOutput: \"bal-loon\" \n\nExplanation:\n  \n  bal-\n  \n  vowel is found: a\n  \n  after the vowel is l which is a consonant so we should add -\n  \n  loon\n  \n  vowel is found: o\n  \n  first o - after it is another o which is a vowel so we should just proceed until we found the next consonant\n  \n  second o - after the vowel is n which is a consonant but we should not add - because it is the last character\n```\n  \n\n  ",
