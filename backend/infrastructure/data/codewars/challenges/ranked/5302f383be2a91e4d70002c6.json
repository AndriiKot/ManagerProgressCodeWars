  "description": "Queen of the Forest needs a function that will add a specified quantity of leading zeros to any given number. \n\nFor example, if a 5-digit number is needed, and we pass in ```11```, the returned value would be ```00011```. There are many ways to achieve this. Additionally, if the size passed is less than the length of number, just return the number as a string. Let's have one that would be both useful and good performance-wise.\n\n\nNOTES: \n\n1) Numbers passed only - no strings, objects, functions, etc. \n\n2) Whole positives only - negatives converted, decimals dropped (provided in solution setup)\n\n",
