  "description": "You are a developer at a new and promising browser company, and are tasked with designing their browser history sorting system. Your goal is to take a tuple of tuples containing the date/time, and title of each individual page, along with a method on how to sort the tuple, and return it as a sorted list or dictionary (See Specifications).\n \n\nSpecifications:\n- Date will be a collection of positive integers (and zero) in the form of XX/XX/XXXX, Time will be XX:XX (also positive integers + zero) \n- If sorted by date/time, return a dictionary containing keys that are \"Today\", \"Yesterday\", \"This Week\", \"This Month\", \"This Year\", and \"Past a Year\" (if there are entries within these time periods) and corresponding values that contain a list of entries within these time periods (sorted by date and time)\n- If sorted by title, it should return it sorted by a priority of capital letters, then prioritized by regular alphabetization.\n- For simplicity's sake, treat a \"month\" as 30 days and a \"year\" as 365\n- Time will be in 24 hour format \"00:00\" with leading zeros for both the hour and minute\n- Current (year) will be in format \"10/09/2010\" and between \"01/01/2000\" and \"12/31/2024\"\n- Dates in history will be in the same format as above and between \"01/01/2000\" and \"current\" (inclusive)\n- Title (URL) will be in the format \"www.randomText.com\" with randomText only consiting of ASCII letters.\n- If multiple tuples are put in a single list, the greater date will come first. (See Example Outputs)\n\nExample Outputs:\n  - For Date:\n  \n``` \n{\n    \"Today\": [(\"09/07/2022\", \"12:15\", \"www.example1.com\"), (\"09/07/2022\", \"08:30\", \"www.example2.com\")],\n    \"This Month\": [(\"08/30/2022\", \"09:45\", \"www.example3.com\")],\n    \"Past a Year\": [(\"07/15/2021\", \"14:30\", \"www.example4.com\"), (\"05/09/2019\", \"10:00\", \"www.example5.com\")]\n} \n```\n  - For Title:\n  \n```\n[\n    (\"08/30/2022\", \"09:45\", \"www.ABC.com\"),\n    (\"07/15/2021\", \"14:30\", \"www.ZZTop.com\"),\n    (\"09/07/2022\", \"08:30\", \"www.example1.com\"),\n    (\"09/07/2022\", \"12:15\", \"www.example2.com\")\n]\n```",
