  "description": "**Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**\n\nThe task is to implement a function `compressRLE` that performs Run-Length Encoding on a given string. Run-Length Encoding is a simple form of data compression where consecutive identical characters are replaced by a single character and a count of how many times it repeats.\n\n**Task:**\n\nWrite a function `compressRLE` that takes a string as input and returns its compressed form using Run-Length Encoding.\n\n**Details:**\n\nGiven a string `str`:\n- If `str` is `null` or empty, the function should return an empty string `\"\"`.\n- Otherwise, replace sequences of consecutive identical characters with the character itself followed by the count of repetitions.\n- Return the compressed string.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- For the input `\"aaabbcccdd\"`, the expected output is `\"a3b2c3d2\"`.\n- For the input `\"abcdefg\"`, which has no repeated characters, the output should be `\"a1b1c1d1e1f1g1\"`.\n- For `null` input or empty string `\"\"`, the output should be `\"\"`.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- The function should not use external libraries or functions that perform similar tasks.\n- Consider efficiency in terms of time and space complexity, especially for large inputs.\n",
