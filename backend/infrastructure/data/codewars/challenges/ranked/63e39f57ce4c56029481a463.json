  "description": "for an assigned number 'x', if x is even than x = x / 2. else x is odd then x = 3x + 1. \n\ngiven that number x, determine whether x is repeating a number and in which position. \n\nExample 1: x = 10\n\n1. x = x / 2 = 5 \n2. x = 3x + 1 = 16\n3. x = x / 2 = 8 \n4. x = x / 2 = 4 \n5. x = x / 2 = 2\n6. x = x / 2 = 1\n7. x = 3x + 1 = 4 \n\nRETURN 5\n\nShould be as efficient as possible in terms of space in runtime.",
