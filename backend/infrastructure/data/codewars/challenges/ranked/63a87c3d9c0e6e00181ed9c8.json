  "description": "In german you can use `ss` and `ß` in the same words. And it will be correct! Like:\n\n`Tschüss` -> `Tschüß`\n\n`Russland` -> `Rußland`\n\n`Weiss` -> `Weiß`\n\n(After the 1996 reforms, the rules changed slightly. Read more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9F#In_pre-1996_orthography)\n\n\n# Task:\n\nYou need to create a function that will change `ss` to `ß`.\n\n`This is my first Kata =)`",
