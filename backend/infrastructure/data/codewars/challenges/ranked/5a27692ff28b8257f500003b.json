  "description": "# Problem\n\n\n\nJohn has drawn some line segments on the x-axis. But he is unsatisfied with his work, because some line segments overlap with others. \n\nSo he decides to erase some of them so that none of them overlaps with others. Of course, John only wants to erase the minimum number of line segments. \n\nNow, John need your help..\n\n# Task\n\nYou are given a 2D integer array `segments`. Each element of `segments` is a 2-elements subarray that represents the start position and end position of a line segment.\n\nYour task is to calculate the minimum number of line segments need to erase, so that none of remaining line segments overlaps with others.\n\nStill not understand the task? Look at the following example ;-)\n\n# Examples\n\nFor `segments = [[1,3],[3,5],[2,4]]`,the output should be `1`.\n```\nThere are 3 segments on the x-axis like this:\n\n0--1--2--3--4--5\n   ------        <-- [1,3]\n         ------- <-- [3,5]\n      -------    <-- [2,4]\n      \nWe can erase 1 segment [2,4]\n```\n\nFor `segments = [[1,3],[3,5],[5,7]]`,the output should be `0`.\n\nNone of segments overlaps with others.\n\nFor `segments = [[1,3],[3,5],[5,7],[2,8]]`,the output should be `1`.\n```\nThere are 4 segments on the x-axis like this:\n\n0--1--2--3--4--5--6--7--8\n   ------                 <-- [1,3]\n         -------          <-- [3,5]\n               -------    <-- [5,7]\n      ------------------- <-- [2,8]\n      \nWe can erase 1 segment [2,8]\n```\n\nFor `segments = [[1,3],[3,5],[5,7],[1,2],[6,9]]`,the output should be `2`.\n```\nThere are 5 segments on the x-axis like this:\n\n0--1--2--3--4--5--6--7--8--9\n   ------                    <-- [1,3]\n         -------             <-- [3,5]\n               -------       <-- [5,7]\n   ----                      <-- [1,2]\n                  ---------- <-- [6,9]\n      \nWe can erase 1 segment [1,2] or [1,3]\nThen erase 1 segment [5,7] or [6,9]\n```\n\nFor `segments = [[1,5],[2,6],[3,7],[4,8],[5,9]]`,the output should be `3`.\n```\nThere are 5 segments on the x-axis like this:\n\n0--1--2--3--4--5--6--7--8--9\n   ------------              <-- [1,5]\n      -------------          <-- [2,6]\n         -------------       <-- [3,7]\n            -------------    <-- [4,8]\n               ------------- <-- [5,9]\n      \nWe can erase 3 segments [2,6], [3,7], [4,8]\n```\n# Note\n\n- Two segments such as `[1,3] and [3,5]` is NOT overlaped by each other. \n\n- `3 <= segments.length <= 100`\n\n- For each subarray [n,m] in `segments`, `1 <= n < m <= 100`\n\n- `segments` may contains duplicate segment. \n\n- I'm not sure that my solution is 100% correct. If there is any doubt, please give feedback ;-)\n\n- Happy Coding `^_^`\n",
