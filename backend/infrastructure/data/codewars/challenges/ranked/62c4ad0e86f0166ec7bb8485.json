  "description": "# Number Pyramid\nImage a number pyramid starts with `1`, and the numbers increasing by `1`. \n\nFor example, when the pyramid has 3 levels:\n\n```\n  1\n 2 3\n4 5 6\n```\n\nAnd the sum of three corners are:\n\n```\n1 + 4 + 6 = 11\n```\n___\n# Input:\n\nYou will be given a number `n`, which means how many levels the pyramid has.\n\n`0 <= n <= 5000`\n___\n# Output:\n\nYou need to return the sum of three corners of the pyramid.\n\n* When there is no level, return `0` as there is no corner.\n\n* When there is only one level, return `1` as it is the only corner.\n\n__Examples:__\n```\nsum_corners(0) --> 0\nsum_corners(1) --> 1\nsum_corners(2) --> 6\nsum_corners(3) --> 11\n```\n___\n# Golfing Message:\n\nThe length of your code should be less or equal to `35`.\n___\nIf you like this series, welcome to do [other kata](https://www.codewars.com/collections/code-golf-number-pyramid-series) of it.",
