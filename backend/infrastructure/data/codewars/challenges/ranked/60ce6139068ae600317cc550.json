  "description": "# Road To Nowhere\nYour goal is to reverse engineer the picture below. You will have to create a general solution that will return the data of the following image for any width and height given.\n\nA code golf version is available [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/60ccf701382b90001826d247).\n\n<img style='width:100%;image-rendering:pixelated' src='https://i.ibb.co/9hfX1wZ/Screenshot-2021-06-19-at-16-41-41.png'>\n\n## Rules\n* You must implement the function `d`.\n* Which takes 2 numbers, width and height.\n* The returned format should be an array of rows, where the rows are arrays of colors, where the colors are arrays, with 3 truthy or falsey values, representing red, green and blue. e.g.```array[height][width][3]```\n\nNote: A helper function ```draw(width, height, array)``` is available to you, which takes an array in the expected return format of ```d```.\n\n## Reference images\n\n<img style='width:100%;image-rendering:pixelated' src=\"https://i.ibb.co/YDV0nMY/Screenshot-2021-06-19-at-20-12-47.png\">\n<img style='width:100%;image-rendering:pixelated' src=\"https://i.ibb.co/4s3yDGX/Screenshot-2021-06-19-at-20-12-38.png\">\n<img style='width:100%;image-rendering:pixelated' src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7yMQKWd/Screenshot-2021-06-19-at-20-12-29.png\">\n<img style='width:100%;image-rendering:pixelated' src=\"https://i.ibb.co/HnQ3v5S/Screenshot-2021-06-19-at-20-12-13.png\">\n",
