  "description": "Anna and Bob are playing tennis, they want you to show the result of their game.\n\nA game is won when a player scores four (or more) points: 15, 30, 40 and the game-winning point.\n\nShould both players make it 40, then the score is called \"DEUCE\". Following deuce, a player must win two consecutive points: the first point, known as \"advantage\" and the game-winning point. \n*IMPORTANT : If the opposing player scores the next point when the player has the advantage, the game once again heads to deuce.\n\n  - 1 point = 15\n  - 2 points = 30\n  - 3 points = 40\n  - 40-40 = Deuce\n  - Server wins deuce point = Ad-In\n  - Receiver wins deuce point = Ad-Out\n\nArray wins is given like following : wins = [\"Anna\",\"Bob\",\"Anna\"] (should return \"Bob 15, Anna 30\", Bob always goes first). Note that wins is never an empty array.\n\nWrite a function get_status(wins) which returns the result as a string as following :\n  - \"DEUCE\" when there is Deuce (40-40, or like said above)\n  - \"30a\" when both players have 30 and \"15a\" when both players have 15\n  - \"Anna ADVANTAGE\" when there is Deuce and Anna (for example) has scored\n  - \"Bob WINS\" when Bob (for example) has the advantage and scored\n  - or simply \"Bob 15, Anna 30\" for other cases\n\n*NOTE : When a player has won, even if the other player has scored after, the winner is the winner (ex: get_status([\"Bob\",\"Anna\",\"Bob\",\"Anna\",\"Bob\",\"Anna\",\"Bob\",\"Bob\",\"Anna\"]) should return \"Bob WINS\")\n  \n",
