  "description": "Your computer contains a password. Your friends know your password, so you find an app that only let people in if they know the encrypted password. You have no idea how to encrypt your password, but you just download the app onto your computer. However, when you try to log in, you forget that you don't know the encrypted password! However, you wrote down to yourself how to encrypt your password.\n\nYou will be given your password, and you have to find out how to encrypt it. Look at an example below.\n\nExample:\nYour password: \"abcde89T!&\"\n\nYour encryped password: \"bzcadbecfd911SU!&\"\n\nFigure out how to encrypt your own password. Good Luck!",
