  "description": "## Overview\n\nIn this kata, `n` grains of rice will be initially placed at `n` **distinct** squares on a 2-dimensional rectangular board.\n\nFor example, if a particular grain starts on the board square at `x=3` and `y=8` it will be given starting \"integer coordinates\" `(3,8)`.\n\nTo keep things simple, all grains will always have coordinates `x>0` and `y>0`.\n\nFrom the starting configuration of `n` grains in `n` distinct locations, your goal is to move the `n` grains individually so that they **all end up together on a same, shared, \"finishing square\".**\n\nYou must move each grain individually and you can only move each grain **1 square at a time** horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.\n\nNow, depending on the finishing square you choose, consider the **total number of moves**, M<sub>total</sub>, you take to move all `n` grains to that particular finishing square: \n\n```\nM_total(chosen finishing square) =\n\nmoves taken by grain 1 from its initial position to the finishing square +\nmoves taken by grain 2 from its initial position to the finishing square +\n... + \nmoves taken by grain n from its initial position to the finishing square\n```\n\nDepending on which square of the board you choose to move all the `n` grains to, you will require a different **total number of moves**,  M<sub>total</sub> .\n\n**Which square(s) on the board requires the minimum total number of moves to move all `n` grains to it?**\n\n---\n\n## Inputs\n\n- You will be given an `n`-element set of `2-tuples`, representing the starting integer coordinates of each of the `n` grains on the board.\n- Each `2-tuple` will be of the form `(x,y)` with `x` and `y` both integers and both `> 0`.\n- There will be no repeated `2-tuples`, corresponding to the fact that all `n` grains start at `n` distinct locations.\n- The input provided to you will always be non-empty, i.e. will always contain at least 1 tuple. Your solution should be able to handle the case of `n=1` grains however.\n\n**Performance requirements:** Values up to `n = 200,000` grains on a single board will be tested.\n\n## Output\n\n- You must return an array of `2-tuples` representing **all the possible finishing squares that can be reached in the minimum total number of moves** for the `n` grains. You can return the array in any order you like.\n\n(Note that in some cases there may be **more than one square** in the board that corresponds to the minimum total number of moves, and you must find **all of them** for your solution to be valid).\n\n---\n\n## Walk-through Example\n\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/B61Pwn6\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/wQvLYcQ/ricegrains.png\" alt=\"ricegrains\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nHere we have `n = 3` grains with their starting positions' integer coordinates given by:\n\n`grains = {(1,3), (2,1), (4,3)}`\n\nThe **minimum total number of moves** to get all `n=3` grains together on the same square is M<sub>total</sub> = 5.\n\nFor this optimal value of M<sub>total</sub> = 5, there is only **1 possible finishing square**:\n\nFinish square = `(2,3)` which corresponds to:\n\n- grain #1 moving `1` step to the right\n- grain #2 moving `2` steps up \n- grain #3 moving `2` steps to the left.\n\nIf you try to move the `n=3` grains to any other possible finish square - such as, say, `(3,1)` - you will require more than M<sub>total</sub> = 5 total moves to do so.\n\nFor example, for `(3,1)`, it would take grain #1 `4` steps to reach it, grain #2 `1` step to reach it, and grain #3 `3` steps, for a total of `4+1+3 = 8` steps which is indeed greater than M<sub>total</sub> = 5 that we claimed is the minimum possible value.\n\nFor this example of input `grains = {(1,3), (2,1), (4,3)}` your solution should therefore return the array with one 2-element tuple: `[ (2,3) ]`",
