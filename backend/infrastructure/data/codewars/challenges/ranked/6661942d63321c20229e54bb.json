  "description": "**Bézout's identity** :\n\nLet ***a***, ***b*** be integers with GCD ***d***. Then there [exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_identity) integers ***u***, ***v***   such that : ***au + bv = d***. This result can be extended to polynomials.\n\n> **If ***g*** is greatest common divisor of two polynomials ***a*** and ***b***(non-zero at the same time), then there exist two polynomials ***u***, ***v*** such that ***au + bv = d*** **.\n\n**Task**\n\nIn this kata your task is to find GCD and coefficients for Bézout's identity for given prime modulus ***p*** and polynomials ***a***, ***b*** (which coefficients are residues **mod** ***p***).\n\nPolynomials would be represented as list of integers with **biggest power** at the start of list.\n\n**Input**\n\nTwo polynomials ***a***, ***b*** given as `lists`.\n\n**Output**\n\nA triple of polynomials : (GCD (with leading coefficient = 1), a's coefficient, b's coefficient).\n\n**Test structure**\n\n* Sample test (4)\n\n* Random test\n  * Small polynomials and modulus (35)\n  \n  * Small polynomials and big modulus (35)\n  \n  * Big polynomials and small modulus (35)\n  \n  * Big polynomials and big modulus (35)\n\n",
