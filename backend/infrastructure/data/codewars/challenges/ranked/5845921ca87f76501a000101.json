It is sorted and shifted array. What's the mean of \"sorted and shifted\"? That is: At first, the array was sorted, like this:\n ```\n arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n ```\n Then the array performs a shift operation(the shift amount is unkown), perhaps became to:\n ```\n [5,6,1,2,3,4]\n ```\n This is what a \"sorted and shifted\" array. \n \n Then given a number `n`, your task is find and return the index of `n`. Or return -1 if `n` is not found.\n \n# Note:\n - Arguments `arr` always be an valid array; All the elements are integers (positive, negative and zero); You can assume that there are no duplicate numbers in the array.\n - Please pay attention to optimizing the code to avoid time out.\n - In the performance test(10000000 elements x 100 testcases), the time consuming of each test case should be within 3ms. This means, Your algorithm should be faster than O(n), your code should run as fast as a rocket ;-) \n\n# Some Examples\n```\nfindIndexOf([5,6,1,2,3,4],3) === 4\nfindIndexOf([9,11,12,1,3,5,7],5) === 5\nfindIndexOf([9,11,12,1,3,5,7],2) === -1\n```",
