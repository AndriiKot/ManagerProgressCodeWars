  "description": "An Intro to Quantum Concepts #2\n===\n\nA quantum operation is a linear transformation, usually written as a unitary matrix, i.e. a matrix whose inverse equals its conjugate transpose.\n\nTask\n---\nCheck whether a matrix\n```\na b\nc d\n```\nis unitary, assuming a floating point accuracy of 1e-6. The matrix is given as a list of real numbers ```[a, b, c, d]``` (actual quantum operations use complex numbers, by the way).",
