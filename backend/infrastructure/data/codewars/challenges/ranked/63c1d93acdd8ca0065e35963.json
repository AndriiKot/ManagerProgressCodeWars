Each letter wants to score as much points as possible, while the numbers are moving around them.\"\n\n```\nExample of a game grid\n\n07004\n0 A 0\n0D7B8\n5 C 4\n02000\n```\n\n### Input\n##### numbers\n- an array of non negative integers representing the points available to score\n\n### Output\n- return a map / dictionary with the scores for each letter when the game ended (see solution setup of your language for more details)\n  \n### Initial Setup\n\n- 17 non negative integers are available, of which 16 on the border and the last one in the center\n- going from left to right in the array of numbers, each border number starts the game on the perimeter, starting at the top-left corner, and going in a clockwise direction\n- the game is played by 4 letters: <code>A, B, C, D</code>\n- the letters have fixed positions in the game, respectively at the top, right, bottom and left of the center number\n- all letters touch 1 border number and the center number\n- at least 1 number with value <code>0</code> is guaranteed to be available\n- all numbers have a value: <code>0 &lt;= n &lt;= 9</code>\n- the game is played in rounds and at the end of each round, numbers move to the next position\n\n```\nExample: \n\nnumbers: [0,7,0,0,4,0,8,4,0,0,0,2,0,5,0,0,7]\n\ngame:\n\n07004\n0 A 0\n0D7B8\n5 C 4\n02000\n\n```\n\n### Structure\n\n- letters start with a score of <code>0</code> and want to score points\n- as long as the objective has not been reached, the game is played in consecutive rounds\n- each round has the following structure:\n  - letters try to score points\n  - numbers make progress\n  - objective is checked\n    - return game result when objective is met\n    - continue with next round otherwise\n  \n#### Letters trying to score points\n\n- the actions of each letter are independant from those of another, meaning the order in which letters are picked to score points is irrelevant\n- a letter has to obey by the following rules:\n  - (note that an actual game consists of 4 letters, while these examples may contain fewer)\n  - if the number on the border which is aligned with the center and the letter, and the center are both <code>0</code>, no points can be scored because no points are available to score\n  ```\n00000\n0 A 0\n0 0 0\n0   0\n00000\n  ```\n  - if the number on the border which is aligned with the center and the letter, and the center are both different from <code>0</code>, no points can be scored because this letter is currently blocked by those numbers\n  ```\n00500\n0 A 0\n0 2 0\n0   0\n00000\n  ```\n  - if the number on the border which is aligned with the center and the letter is <code>0</code> and the center number isn't:\n    - the letter scores the amount of the center number (<code>A: +2, B: +2</code> in example)\n    - the border number becomes the center number subtracted by one (<code>border numbers of A and B: (2 - 1) = 1</code> in example)\n    - the center number gets reset to <code>0</code>, but only <b>after</b> all numbers have tried scoring in this round\n  ```\n00000     00100\n0 A 0     0 A 0\n0 2B0  -> 0 0B1\n0   0     0   0\n00000     00000\n  ```\n  - if the center number is <code>0</code> and the number on the border which is aligned with the center and the letter isn't:\n    - the letter scores the amount of the border number (<code>A: +4, B: +3</code> in example)\n    - the center number is increased with the border number subtracted by one  (<code>center: (4 - 1) + (3 - 1) = 5</code> in example), but only <b>after</b> all numbers have tried scoring in this round, and the resulting value in the center will be the sum of moves performed by the individual letters\n    - the border number gets reset to <code>0</code>\n  ```\n00400     00000\n0 A 0     0 A 0\n0 0B3  -> 0 5B0\n0   0     0   0\n00000     00000\n  ```\n\n#### Numbers make progress\n\n- the border numbers rotate clockwise\n- the center number is stationary, so it doesn't move\n\n```\nExample: \n\nNote that the last number is the center number, it remains fixed as last element in the array.\n\nnumbers before rotation: [0,3,0,0,4,0,8,4,0,0,0,2,0,5,0,1,7]\nnumbers after rotation : [1,0,3,0,0,4,0,8,4,0,0,0,2,0,5,0,7]\n\n```\n\n#### Checking objective\n\n- the game ends when either:\n  - at least one letter reached a score of <code>100</code> or more\n  - all numbers have been decreased to <code>0</code>\n  \n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary style=\"\n    padding: 3px;\n    width: 100%;\n    border: none;\n    font-size: 18px;\n    box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px #bbbbbb;
