  "description": "### Task: \n- You get two sticks of lengths > 0 \n- You can break them into pieces of integer lengths\n- Your task is to construct the **biggest square** from those sticks, which means that you need 4 pieces of the same length\n- The longer the side of the square, the bigger the square\n\n### Output:\n- if square can be constructed --> **length of the side of that square**\n- if square can't be constructed --> **0**\n\n\n### Examples:  \n`square(0.25, 3.75) -> 0`  \n3 pieces of length 1 -> no square\n\n`square(2, 2) -> 1`  \n4 pieces of length 1 -> square, side_length = 1\n\n`square(5, 14) -> 4`  \n4 pieces of length 4 -> square, side_length = 4",
