  "description": "## Introduction\n\nIn a parallel universe not too distant from our own, *Julius Caesar* finds himself locked in a fierce conflict with *Genghis Khan*.\n\nLegend has it that Khan's armies were renowned for their mastery of horseback archery, a formidable advantage in battle. To level the playing field, divine intervention granted Caesar a helping hand.\n\nWith divine assistance, *Big Jul* gained the ability to impart his knowledge to his troops, a boon bestowed upon **all of his men**. He could impart any skill he possessed to those who lacked it.\n\nSkills, in this universe, are represented by the binary representation of an integer. Each bit corresponds to a specific skill, with `1` denoting proficiency and `0` representing ignorance.\n\nUsing his wisdom, Caesar could transform any `0` to a `1` if he himself possessed the corresponding skill.\n\nArmed with the value `n`, representing his own skills, Caesar sets out to enhance the abilities of his troops, numbering from `1` to `n`. Time is of the essence as the threat of the approaching Asian cavalry looms ever closer.\n\n## Task\n\nGiven a **positive integer** `n`, return the sum of the **Bitwise OR** operation between `n` and **all integers** from `1` to `n` (both inclusive). In fancy math terms: `$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}n|i$`, where `|` is the **Bitwise OR** operation.\n\n## Performance\n\n**Brute force** solutions, yielding a time complexity of `O(n)`, won't work.\n\nThe **expected** time complexity is `O(logn)`. Most solutions with a time complexity **equal or close** to that should pass **with ease**.\n\n```python\nRandom Tests: 100\nInteger Size: 1 to 10 ** 100\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\n1 -> 1\n2 -> 5\n3 -> 9\n4 -> 22\n10 -> 121\n100 -> 11302\n```",
