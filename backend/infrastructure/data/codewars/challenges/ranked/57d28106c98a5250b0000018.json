  "description": "Your task is to write function ```divide(P1, P2)``` that divides [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial) P1 by another polynomial P2. We assume that both of them are in [the standard form](http://www.mathwarehouse.com/dictionary/S-words/definition-of-standard-form-of-a-polynomial.php). In addition to that, we assume that none of the powers is missing, therefore P1 is **always** in the form ```ax**n+bx**(n-1)+...+wx**2+yx+z``` and P2 is **always** in the form ```x+a```.\n\nInput:\n\n> P1, P2 – polynomials\n\nOutput:\n> R – string, polinomial, the result of the division.\n\n> O – integer, the remainder of the division.\n\nR and O are such that ```R * P2 + O = P1```\n\nExample:\n\n```python\ndivide('2x**4+5x**3-4x**2+x+1','x+1')\n```\n\nshould return \n\n```python\n['2x**3+3x**2-7x+8', -7]\n```\n\n*Please, report if you find any problems or mistakes. I will do my best to correct them.*",
