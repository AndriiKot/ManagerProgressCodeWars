  "description": "### You work at a taxi central.\n\nPeople contact you to order a taxi. They inform you of the time they want to be picked up and dropped off. \n\nA taxi is available to handle a new customer 1 time unit after it has dropped off a previous customer.\n\n**What is the minimum number of taxis you need to service all requests?**\n\n### Constraints:\n\n* Let **N** be the number of customer requests:\n  - **N** is an integer in the range **[1, 100k]**\n* All times will be integers in range **[1, 10k]**\n* Let **PU** be the time of pickup and **DO** be the time of dropoff\n  - Then for each request: **PU < DO**\n* The input list is **NOT sorted**.\n\n### Examples:\n\n```python\n# Two customers, overlapping schedule. Two taxis needed.\n# First customer wants to be picked up 1 and dropped off 4.\n# Second customer wants to be picked up 2 and dropped off 6.\nrequests = [(1, 4), (2, 6)]\nmin_num_taxis(requests) # => 2\n\n# Two customers, no overlap in schedule. Only one taxi needed.\n# First customer wants to be picked up 1 and dropped off 4.\n# Second customer wants to be picked up 5 and dropped off 9.\nrequests = [(1, 4), (5, 9)]\nmin_num_taxis(requests) # => 1\n```\n```haskell\n-- Two customers, overlapping schedule. Two taxis needed.\n-- First customer wants to be picked up 1 and dropped off 4.\n-- Second customer wants to be picked up 2 and dropped off 6.\n>>> let requests = [(1, 4), (2, 6)]\n>>> minNumTaxis requests -- 2\n\n-- Two customers, no overlap in schedule. Only one taxi needed.\n-- First customer wants to be picked up 1 and dropped off 4.\n-- Second customer wants to be picked up 5 and dropped off 9.\n>>> let requests = [(1, 4), (5, 9)]\n>>> minNumTaxis requests -- 1\n```\n",
