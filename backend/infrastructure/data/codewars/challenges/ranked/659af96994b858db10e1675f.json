  "description": "### Problem Statement\n\nYou're given a string of digits representing a sequence of consecutive natural numbers concatenated together. Your task is to find the smallest possible first number in the sequence. The sequence starts with a single or multi-digit number and continues with numbers each incremented by 1. If multiple sequences can be formed, choose the one that starts with the smallest number.\n\n### Examples\n\n- \"123\" -> [1, 2, 3] -> 1\n- \"91011\" -> [9, 10, 11] -> 9\n- \"17181920\" -> [17, 18, 19, 20] -> 17\n- \"9899100\" -> [98, 99, 100] -> 98\n- \"91\" -> [91] -> 91\n- \"121122123\" -> [121, 122, 123] -> 121\n- \"1235\" -> [1235] -> 1235\n- \"101\" -> [101] -> 101\n\n### Constraints\n\n- Input string length: 1 - 200 characters.\n- Smallest possible first number: 1 - 1,000,000,000.\n\nRemember, the key is to form a sequence of **consecutive natural numbers**. If the sequence matches the input string, you've found the smallest possible first number. Experiment with different lengths for the first number until you find a match or exhaust all possibilities.\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n### Encodings\n\nThe input sequence will be encoded as a `List` of single digit `Number`s ( but shown in test failure messages as a `String` );  \nthe output number must be encoded as a `List` of single digit `Number`s ( but shown in test failure messages as a `Number` ).\n\npurity: `LetRec`  \nnumEncoding: `Scott`  \n\nexport constructors `nil, cons` and deconstructor `foldl` for your `List` encoding.\n~~~",
