  "description": "**Every** odd number and **Most** even numbers can be expressed as difference of two perfect squares.  **𝘢² － 𝘣² ＝ 𝘤**\n\nYour task: \n\nGenerate all pairs of numbers where the difference between their squares equals the given number, return a sorted array of arrays where each element is a pair  \n___\n\nExample: n = 140\n\n140 can be expressed as **12² - 2²**, \n\n140 can aslo be expressed as **36² - 34²**\n\nSo you need to return [[2, 12], [34, 36]] *(array is sorted, and inner elements are sorted as well)*\n\nAnother Example: n = 4355\n\n4355 can be expressed as **66² - 1²** , **174² - 161²**  ,   **438²-433²** and **2178²-2177²**\nSo you need to return [[1, 66], [161, 174], [433, 438], [2177, 2178]]\n\nYou need to come up with an efficient algorithm, brute force solutions won't work. for example 39711373892391267864157547808 can be expressed as difference of 1024 different pairs \n________________________\n1. 5 fixed tests\n2. 30 tiny tests\n3. 30 very small tests\n4. 45 small tests\n5. 49 medium tests\n6. 10 big tests\n\nNumber will be randomly generated, max value will is 10^42, **importing gmpy2 is not allowed** *(word \"gympy2\" is also banned)*\n\n**Number Generation**: As you're aware, processing exceedingly large numbers (e.g., 10^40 +) can be quite time-consuming. To optimize testing, numbers are generated within the range of 10^25 to 10^26 and then multiplied by randomly selected large prime numbers from a predefined list.",
