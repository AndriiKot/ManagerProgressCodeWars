  "description": "This kata is based on the Ruby version of Recursive Averages (http://www.codewars.com/kata/recursive-averages).\n\nModify the Array class to include an average method. The method give the average value of the items it contains. For example:\n```javascript\n[1,2,3].average()  #=> 2\n```\nBut wait, there's more! If any item in the array is also an array, the method should calculate that average first, like so:\n```javascript\n[1,2,[2,4]].average()  #=> 2\n```\nThe method should first average [2,4] into 3, and then average the resulting [1,2,3] into 2.\n\nOne more caveat: the method should attempt to work with non-numbers:\n```javascript\n[1,2,'3 doors down'].average()  #=> 2 where \"3 doors down\" == 3\n[0.4, '1.6'].average()  #=> 1 where '1.6' == 1.6\n```",
