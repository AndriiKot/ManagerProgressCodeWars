  "description": "&emsp; You are cleaning out your attic and find an old TV. Intrigued, you turn it on. However, you are aghast at the number of dead pixels that litter the screen. You take the TV out of the attic and decide you want to find the original number of pixels on the TV, so you start investigating and find the following:\n\n1. The longest number of pixels on the TV spans the entire width of the TV\n2. All of the dead pixels only occur on the right side\n\n&emsp; You decide to write a program to find the original number of pixels on the TV. The program takes a jagged array as input, where each row is a row of pixels on the TV. The program finds the length of the longest row of pixels, multiplies it by the number of rows, and then returns this number as the original number of pixels on the TV. \n\n\n[Learn more about: Jagged Arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_array)",
