  "description": "In this kata your task is to write a code which will determine the correct shape and calculate its area. \nInput arguments will always be positive floats. If one of the input values is equal to zero, that means the shape in mind doesn't use it.\nOnly four shapes will be tested: square, circle, rectangle and 90 45 45 triangle.\nYour code should return the name of the shape and its area in a string as shown in the example below:\n\n```python\nshape_area(4.00, 2.5, 0.00), \"Rectangle with area of 10\"\n```\nArea should be rounded (as a whole number), meaning both 5.00 and 5.60 should be returned as 5.\nInput arguments are always given from left to right, meaning that if an argument is equal to zero, it's always the most right one/ones. \n\nIf the given shape is a circle, area should be returned as shown in the example below:\n```python\nshape_area(3.00, 0.00, 0.00), \"Circle with area of 9pi\"\n```\nQuick reminder - don't forget to check if the given arguments can be sides of a triangle or at least of a right one. If they can't, return None, same as when all arguments are equal to 0.\n\n",
