  "description": "Four of a kind\n===\n\nA set of three playing cards of the same rank is called a *triple*. A set of four is called *four of a kind*.  \n\nYou play this deterministic game by drawing cards from a shuffled deck, one per turn, and putting them in a pile. In one version of the game, you win if your pile eventually contains *two* triples before it contains any four of a kind.  \n\nFor example, suppose the cards you've drawn so far have ranks `[4,6,4,7,1,6,4]`. If your next card is 6, you win---you have (4,4,4) and (6,6,6) as triples. If your next card is 4, you lose---you have (4,4,4,4) as four of a kind. If your card is anything else, you keep playing.\n\nI wonder how likely you are to win this game?  To generalize, please write a function `(win-probability n k)` that computes the probability of winning a version of the game where you must see `k` triples in your pile before any four of a kind (`1<=k<=n+1`), and the deck consists of `n` different ranks, with four cards of each rank. (In an ordinary deck of cards, there are `n=13` different ranks.) \n\nAnswers should be exact, rational numbers (e.g. 1/3)&mdash;no floats.\n\n\n#### Note: \n\nIn an ordinary deck of cards, there are 13 ranks, and 4 cards of each rank.  So in the extreme case,  `(win-probability 13 1)` is 100% and `(win-probability 13 14)` is 0%, while win probabilities for other `k` values lie somewhere in between.",
