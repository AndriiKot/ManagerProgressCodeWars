  "description": "You have many friends. Some your friends know each other. It's a different friends' circles.\nSometimes friendship can be broken and friends' circles too.\n\nYour task is to write a function `friendsCircles` wich to count how many different friends' circles you have after each change in your friends' relationships.\n\nIn `friendsCircles` function:\n* count of `friends` is Int, 1 < `friends` < 20e4\n```swift\nfriends: 3\n```\n* list of `friendships`, 0 < `friendship`. Can be repeated (like a strong relationship) and can be symmetric.\n```swift\nfriendship: [Friendship(1, 2)]\n```\n* list of Int `index` of `brokenFriendship`, 0 < `index`, 0 < `brokenFriendship`\n```swift\nbrokenFriendship: [1]\n```\n\nFriend without any `friendship` also is your friend circle.\n\n###### Examples:\n```swift\n// Should return [2, 3]\nfriendsCircles(friends: 3, friendship: [Friendship(1, 2)], brokenFriendship: [1])\n\n// Should return [1, 1, 2]\nfriendsCircles(friends: 2, friendship: [Friendship(1, 2), Friendship(1, 2)], brokenFriendship: [1, 2])\n```\n\nMore details in `Initial solution` section.",
