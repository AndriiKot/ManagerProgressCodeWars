  "description": "There are 'n' number of light switches, and 'p' number of people. The beginning/default state of all light switches are off. The first person turns every light switch on, and every additional person toggles the light switches equivalent to the multiple of number person they are. In other words, the second person turns every other light switch off, the third person toggles every third switch to the opposite of whatever its current state is, etc.\n\nGiven 'n' switches and 'p' people, return which light switches will be on, and which will be off in an array. Return 0 for every switch that will be off at the end, and 1 for every switch that will be on in the end.\n\n\n```\nExample: lightSwitches(n=5, p=5) => ['on', 'off', 'off', 'on', 'off'];\n         lightSwitches(n=2, p=3) => ['on', 'off'];\n```",
