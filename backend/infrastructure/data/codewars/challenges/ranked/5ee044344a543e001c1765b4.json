  "description": "***\nNicky has had Myopia (Nearsightedness) since he was born. Because he always wears glasses, he really hates digits `00` and he loves digits `1` and `2`. He calls numbers that contain two consecutive zeros (`00`) Blind Numbers. \n\nFor example, `122000` **is** a blind number because it contains `00`. However, `2010` **is not** a blind number because it doesn't contain `00`.\n***\n\n### Task\nNicky will give you `n`. Your task is to find the number of **non-blind** numbers with length `n` (**in base 10**), that only consist of the digits 0, 1 and 2.\n***\n\n### Note📝\nWe include 0 in the beginning of number also. (i.e. number is zero-padded; if n = `5` and number is `12`, number will be `00012`)\n\nThe results will be very huge, so return the answer modulo `1000000007`.\n\n### Example \n`n = 3`\n\nThe answer is 22. The below list is all 27 possible numbers of length 3 with digits 0-2, and we don't include the 5 numbers that contain `00`. (`000, 001, 002, 100 and 200`)\n\n```\n[000, 001, 002, 010, 011, 012, 020, 021, 022, 100, 101, 102, 110, 111, 112, 120 121, 122, 200, 201, 202, 210 , 211, 212, 220, 221, 222]\n```\n### Constraints\n\n`1 ≤ n ≤ 500000`\n",
