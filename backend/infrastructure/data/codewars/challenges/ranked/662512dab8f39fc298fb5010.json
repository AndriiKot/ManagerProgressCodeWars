  "description": "Hello, programmer of the Farmer's Company! You've got a task: you need to create a function that can determine when workers of different levels will finish their work.\n\nIn our garden, we have three types of trees:\n\n```\n'(-' represents an oak, which takes 2 hours to cut down.\n'{-' represents a birch, which takes 1 hour to cut down.\n'[-' represents a pine, which takes 3 hours to cut down.\n```\n\nWe also have different teams:\n```\nSenior - works for 1 hour with no break.\nMiddle - works for 45-minute with a 15-minute break.\nJunior - works for 1 hour with a 1 hour break.\n```\n\nBased on this data, you receive a string representing the plan of trees in your garden and the team working on it. Your task is to return the time it will take to finish the work.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nhowManyHours('(-{-(-', 'Senior') - result: '5 hour'\nhowManyHours('(-{-(-', 'Junior') - result: '10 hour'\nhowManyHours('(-{-(-', 'Middle') - result: '7 hour'\n```\n\nAny work time is rounded up to the nearest hour. For example, 6.6 hours will be rounded up to 7 hours.\n\nAdditionally, in case we receive an incorrect description of the garden, we need to handle the error:\n```\nhowManyHours('{-{-[{-', 'Middle') - error\n```\n",
