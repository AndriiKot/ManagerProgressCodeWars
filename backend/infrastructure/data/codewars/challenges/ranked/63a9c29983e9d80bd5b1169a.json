  "description": "Andrew Tate wants to determine the color of his next Bugatti. The next color of his bugatti will be the color that is lacking from the color matrix of Andrew Tate's top g colors, since Andrew Tate already has Bugattis in those colors.\n\nFor example, if we have the color string:\n```python\ncolor = \"White\"\n```\n\nThen that color must not exist in the list of strings top_g_color:\n\n```python\ntop_g_color = [\"Black\", \"Copper\", \"Mahogany\"]\n```\n\nDon't forget our Bugatti!\n```python\nbugatti = \"Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport\"\n```\n\nWhich in this case, it does not, so then the function when called should return the following string:\n```python\nandrewTatesBugatti(color, bugatti, top_g_colors) -> \"White Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport\"\n```",
