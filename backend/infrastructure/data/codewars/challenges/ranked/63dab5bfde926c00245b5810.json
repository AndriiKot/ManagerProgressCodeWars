  "description": "In https://www.codewars.com/kata/63d6dba199b0cc0ff46b5d8a, you were given an integer `n >= 1` and asked to find the determinant of the `n`-by-`n` matrix `m` with elements `m[i][j] = i * j, 1 <= i,j <= n`.\n\nThis task is identical, but the matrix elements are given by `m[i][j] = i ** j`; that is, with power instead of multiplication. Also, the case `n = 0` will be tested. Return your answer modulo `1 000 000 007`.\n\n<h1>Code Limit</h1>\n\nNo more than 62 characters. Reference solution is 59 characters, so there should be some leeway.\n\n<h1>Inputs</h1>\n\nA non-negative integer `n <= 800`. There will be a few fixed tests plus 400 random tests within this range.",
