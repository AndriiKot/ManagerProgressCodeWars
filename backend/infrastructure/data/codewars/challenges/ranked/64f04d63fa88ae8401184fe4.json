  "description": "# Task\nGiven a set of 3 jugs of water that have capacities of a, b, and c liters, find the minimum number of operations performed before each jug has x, y, and z liters. Only jug C will start completely filled.\n\nAn operation is any of the following: A jug is filled, or water is poured from one jug to another until one of the jugs is either empty or full.\n\nCreate a function that, given an array of jug capacities `[A, B, C]` and an goal state array `[x, y, z]`, returns the minimum number of operations needed to reach the goal state. If there is no possible solution, return `-1`.\n\n### Examples\n```\ncap = [3, 5, 8], goal = [0, 3, 5] ➞ 2\n# jugs A, B, and C with capacities of 3, 5, and 8, where jugs A and B start empty and C has the full 8, require 2 operations to reach the state of 0, 3, and 5 liters in the jugs.\n\ncap = [1, 3, 4], goal = [0, 2, 2] ➞ 3\n\ncap = [8, 17, 20], goal = [0, 10, 10] ➞ 9\n\ncap = [4, 17, 22], goal = [2, 5, 15] ➞ -1\n\ncap = [3, 5, 8], goal = [0, 0, 9] ➞ -1\n```\n\n### Notes\n- The amount of water in a jug can never exceed the capacity of that jug.",
