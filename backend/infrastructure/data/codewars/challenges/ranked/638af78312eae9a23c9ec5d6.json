  "description": "You have a natural number ```d```.\n\nYou need to write a function ```f(d)``` which finds the smallest positive number ```n``` having ```d``` divisors .\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nf(1) = 1\nf(3) = 4\nf(60) = 5040\nf(420) = 9979200\n```\n\nIn this kata all the tests will be with ```1 <= d <= 10000```\n\nKeep in mind that ```n``` can be on the order of `$10^{300}$`, so iterating over ```n``` and finding the divisors in total for  `$O(n\\sqrt{\\mathstrut n})$` operations is not an option.\n\nGood luck!",
