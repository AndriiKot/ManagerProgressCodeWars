  "description": "There is a row of ants. An ant can be represented by letter \"R\" - facing right, and \"L\" - facing left.\nEvery ant is moving with constant speed. When ants collide, they are changing their direction to opposite.\nOur task is to count collisions for each ant. There is a starting gap between ants, lets say that it is 2 meters.\n\nExample: \"RL\"\n\nShould return \"1 1\"\nBecause they collide each other once, and then they never collide, because earth is flat.\n\nYou will have to count bumps up to 1 000 000 ants.\n\nI am not a real author of this great algorithm challenge. I cant name the author though. Here is the only source i could have find\nhttps://sio2.mimuw.edu.pl/c/pa-2024-1/p/mro/ , it is in polish.",
