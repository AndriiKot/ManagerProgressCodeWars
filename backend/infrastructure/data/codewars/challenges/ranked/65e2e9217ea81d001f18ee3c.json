  "description": "## Background\n\nA person standing between two cliffs claps his hands. How long until he hears the echo of the clap? And the second echo? Third echo?\n\nTo answer this question, Johny decides to write a function. However, he can't seem to figure out how!\n\nWill you help him?\n\n## Task\n\nWrite a function **echo_time** which accepts the following parameters:\n\n1) ```d1``` : The distance between the cliffs (in meters)\n2) ```d2``` : The distance between the person and the nearest cliff (in meters)\n\nIt should return the following:\n\n1) After how long the first echo will be heard (in seconds)\n2) After how long the second echo will be heard (in seconds)\n3) After how long the third echo will be heard (in seconds)\n\n## Notes\n\n1) Return the required information in the form of a tuple \n2) Take the speed of sound in air as **340 m/s**\n3) Do NOT round your answers\n\n## Good Luck!",
