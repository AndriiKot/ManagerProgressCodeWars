  "description": " A DWGSD (day of the week given a specific date) calculator is, rather obviosly, a calculator that given a specific date works out the day of the week.\n \n For example, given 26/02/2023 the output would be sunday.\n \n Your task is to make the function DWGSD which takes in a date given in dd/mm/yyyy as a string, and outputs the day of the week. The date will be between 01/01/2000 and 31/12/2999.\n Please note that every 100 years is NOT a leap year but every 400 IS.\n \n Good luck!\n \n This is my first kata so let me know of any problems.\n",
