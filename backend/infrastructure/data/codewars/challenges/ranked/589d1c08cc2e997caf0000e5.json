  "description": "# Task\n You are given an sequence of zeros and ones. With each operation you are allowed to remove consecutive equal elements, however you may only remove single elements if no more groups of consective elements remain. How many operations will it take to remove all of the elements from the given sequence?\n \n# Example\n\n For `arr = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]`, the result should be `2`.\n \n It can be cleared in two steps:\n \n `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0] -> [0, 0] -> [].`\n \n For `arr = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`, the result should be `3`.\n \n It can be cleared in three steps:\n \n `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 1] -> [0] -> []`\n \n Note that you can not remove `1` at the first step, because you cannot remove just one element while there are still groups of consective elements (see the rule above ^_^)\n\n~~~if:javascript\n### Input\n\nAn array `arr` of 0s and 1s.<br>\n`1 <= arr.length <= 100`\n\n### Output\n\nThe minimum number (integer) of operations.\n~~~\n~~~if:python\n### Input\n\nA list `lst` of 0s and 1s.<br>\n`1 <= len(lst) <= 100`\n\n### Output\n\nThe minimum number (integer) of operations.\n~~~\n  \n# Special thanks: \nThanks for docgunthrop's solution ;-)",
