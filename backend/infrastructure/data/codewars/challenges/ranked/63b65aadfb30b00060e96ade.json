  "description": "In this kata, you will implement a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the missing number in the list.\n\nThe list of integers will always be in ascending order and will contain at least two elements. One of the integers will be missing. Your task is to find the missing integer.\n\nExample\n\nfindMissingNumber([1, 3, 4, 5])\nThe missing number is 2, so the function should return 2.\n\nfindMissingNumber([2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8])\nThe missing number is 5, so the function should return 5.\n\nConstraints\nThe list of integers will contain at least two elements and at most 10^5 elements.\nThe integers in the list will be in the range [1, 10^5].\n\nNote\nThe list of integers will always be in ascending order.\nThere will always be exactly one missing integer.",
