  "description": "## Overview\n\nThe usual way of dividing a pizza is fair but really boring; you place `n` points evenly spaced around the perimeter of the pizza, then cut towards the centre point - you always obtain a total of `n` equally sized, equally shaped pieces.\n\nSuppose for your next pizza you do the following: you place `n` points **any way you like** around the perimeter of the pizza, and you cut through **all possible straight lines** formed by the `n` points.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of pieces that you can cut your pizza into?\n\nNote: the pieces **don't** have to be of the same size or shape. Also some pieces may be completely \"internal\" and not touch the perimeter's crust (perfect for people on a low-carb diet).\n\n---\n\n## Inputs and Outputs\n\nYou will be given an `integer`, `n`, representing the number of points you can place on the perimeter of your pizza. \n\nThe value of `n` will always be `n >= 2`; when you have `0` or `1` point you cannot divide the original pizza into more than the 1 original \"piece\".\n\nInput values up to `n = 1000` will be tested in random tests.\n\nYou must return an `integer`, representing the maximum number of pieces you can cut your pizza into using the algorithm described above.\n\n---\n\n## Code golf requirement \n\nDepending on language, your kata solution code must be less than or equal to the following number of characters:\n\n- Python: `<= 42` characters\n\n- JavaScript: `<= 42` characters\n\n---\n\n## Example with (magnificent) illustration\n\nClick the thumbnail to see full-sized illustration:\n\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/bvMVCbH\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/bvMVCbH/pizza-kata-codewars.png\" alt=\"pizza-kata-codewars\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nIn this example with `n = 4` points placed around the perimeter of the pizza, you can create a maximum total of `8` pieces by cutting along all the `6` lines formed by the `n = 4` points.\n\nTherefore, `pizza(4) = 8`.",
