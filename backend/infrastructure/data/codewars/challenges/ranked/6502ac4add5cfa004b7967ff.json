  "description": "Create a function that accepts two natural numbers `a` and `b` as inputs. This function should output a string that represents the rational number **a divided by b** as a _decimal fraction_. The resulting decimal may be repeating, which means that after some point, a sequence of digits will repeat indefinitely.\n\n### Examples\n```python\n(2, 5) ➞ \"0.4\"\n# 2 divided by 5 equals 0.4, which is a terminating decimal\n\n(1, 6) ➞ \"0.1(6)\"\n# 1 divided by 6 equals 0.1666..., where 6 repeats indefinitely. This is represented as 0.1(6)\n\n(1, 7) ➞ \"0.(142857)\"\n# 1 divided by 7 equals 0.142857142857..., where the sequence 142857 repeats indefinitely. This is represented as 0.(142857)\n```\n\n### Notes\n- Always `a < b`.\n- `0 < a <= 100, 0 < b <= 10^4`",
