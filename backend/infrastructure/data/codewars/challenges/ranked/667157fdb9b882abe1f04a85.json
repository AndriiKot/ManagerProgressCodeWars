  "description": "Your task is to implement a function called uniqueness that takes a single argument, a string, and returns a boolean value. The function should determine if every word of the sentence have unique characters. In other words, it should return true if there are no word with reapeating characters in the string, and false otherwise.\n\nWords are separated from each other using spaces.\n\n\n\nInput\n\n    A single argument, string, which is a string consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase letters.\n    The string can be empty.\n\nOutput\n\n    true if all words in the string are unique.\n    false if there are any words with repeating characters in the string.\n\nExamples\n\n    isUnique(\"abcdef\") should return true because all characters are unique.\n    isUnique(\"aabcdef\") should return false because the character 'a' repeats.\n    isUnique(\"\") should return true because an empty string has no characters, and thus no repeats.\n    isUnique(\"AaBbCc\") should return true because all characters are unique, considering case sensitivity.\n",
