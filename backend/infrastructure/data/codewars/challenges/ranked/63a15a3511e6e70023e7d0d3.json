  "description": "A stealthy burglar is causing a big headache for people in a town. He is known to be swift in getting in the house unnoticed and steal all the diamonds from the locker. He holds a bag in one hand and picks the diamonds from other hand, while stealing.\n\n## Kata  \nYour objective - if choose to accept - is to calculate and return an `integer` representing the minimum number of repetitions required for the burglar to pick all the diamonds from the locker.\n\n## Input\n`locker` - An array of strings representing a single locker. The length of the array will be between 1 - 10 (inclusive): `1 <= locker <= 10`. \n\n    ['*.*.*.*.*.',\n     '...*..**..',\n     '**.**...*.',\n     '**..**..**']\n    \n    Every item indicates a row and has a length of exact 10\n    \n    Notations:\n    . = An empty space\n    * = A Diamond!\n    \n## Useful Info\n\n1. The burglar steals a single diamond every time but can steal two if diamonds are horizontally adjacent to each other.\n2. The burglar cannot steal more than two diamonds at once.\n3. A row in the locker can have 0 diamonds.\n4. The locker will have at least 1 diamond in it.\n5. All the inputs are valid.\n\n## Example\n    \n    `locker` array:\n    ['*.*.*.*.*.',\n     '...*..**..',\n     '**.**...*.',\n     '**..**..**']\n    \nFrom top:\n1. 1st row - burglar needs `5 repetitions`\n2. 2nd row - needs only `2 repetitions`, because both 2nd and 3rd diamond can be grabbed at once since they are horizontally adjacent.\n3. 3rd row - needs `3 repetitions`\n4. 4th row - needs `3 repetitions`\n\n> So, the burglar needs a minimum of __13__ repetitions to steal all the diamonds.",
