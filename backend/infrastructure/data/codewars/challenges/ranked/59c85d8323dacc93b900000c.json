  "description": "Often, we see results of gallups, like this:\n```\nPrefer red: 3.5%\nPrefer green: 4.5%\nPrefer yellow: 22.0%\nPrefer blue: 70.0%\n```\nand you begin to wonder: how many people did they really ask? If the numbers are simple, like `20%, 40%, and 40%`, you know that they asked `5` people (or 10, or 15, or more, but we are interested in the minimum number of people).\n\n\n# Task\n\nYour task is, complete function `gallup`. Function accepts argument `percentages`(a floating number array of percentages).  The result should be the minimum number of people(We know that this number is always less than `10000`). If no valid result, return `-1`.\n\n\n# Example\n\nFor `percentages = [20,40,40]`, The output should be `5`.\n\n```\ngallup of 5 people may be:    1    2    2\npercentages of results:      1/5  2/5  2/5\nrounding to 0 decimal place: 20%  40%  40%\n```\n\nFor `percentages = [33.3,33.3,33.3]`, The output should be `3`.\n```\ngallups of 3 people may be:     1     1      1\npercentages of results:       1/3    1/3    1/3\nrounding to 1 decimal place: 33.3%  33.3%  33.3%\n```\n\n\nFor `percentages = [33,67]`, The output should be `3`.\n```\ngallups of 3 people may be:    1      2\npercentages of results:       1/3    2/3\nrounding to 0 decimal place:  33%    67%\n```\n\nFor `percentages = [100.0000]`, The output should be `1`.\n\nFor `percentages = [50,51]`, The output should be `200`.\n```\ngallups of 200 people may be:      99             101\npercentages of results:       99/200(0.495)   101/200(0.505)\nrounding to 0 decimal place:       50%            51%\n```\n\nFor `percentages = [49,50]`, The output should be `-1`.\n\nNo such a number of people in the range`(1,10000)`\n\n# Note\n\n- All inputs are valid.\n\n- The percentages always add up to `about 100%` as there may be small rounding errors. Numbers are rounded when digits are removed; they are rounded upwards if the first removed digit is 5 or more. Thus, 4.472 is rounded to 4.47, 4.5, or 4, depending on how many digits we want.\n\n- In each testcase, all the numbers are having the same precision.\n\n- In order to avoid timeout, be aware of the code's performance ;-)\n\n- I'm not sure that my results are 100% correct. If some issue was found, please give me a feedback. Thanks ;-)\n\n- Happy Coding `^_^`\n",
