  "description": "Your task - is to write a calculator for square matrices that is able to process commands \"+\", \"-\", \"*\". \n\nAs an argument to the function, two square matrices in the form of two-dimensional arrays and the name of the operation (+, - or *) are given. You need to output the resulting matrix.\n\nFor the addition or subtraction operation, it is necessary to add or subtract the corresponding elements of the matrix.\nFor matrices [[1, 2],[3,4]] + [[5,6],[7,8]] it is necessary to output [[6, 8], [10, 12]] = [[1+5, 2+6], [3+7, 4+8]]\n\nMatrix multiplication is performed by multiplying a row by a column. The products of the first row element and the first column element, the second row element and the second column element, etc. are found. Then the resulting products are summed up.\nFor matrices [[1, 2],[3,4]] * [[5,6],[7,8]] \n\nit is necessary to output [[19, 22], [43, 50]] = [[1 * 5 + 2 * 7, 1 * 6 + 2 * 8], [3 * 5 + 4 * 7, 3 * 6 + 4 * 8]]\n\n\nGood luck!",
