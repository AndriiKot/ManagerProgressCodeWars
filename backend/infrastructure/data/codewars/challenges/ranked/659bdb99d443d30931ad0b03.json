  "description": "You will be given a 5 by 5 array of letters, as well as 4 words to find. You task is to locate all four of the words, and return a new 5x5 array marking their locations.\n\n### Instructions for marking the word's positions:\n\n* use `0` for a letter that is not part of a word, just there to fill space\n* for each letter in the word replace it with that word's index. (starting at one, not zero)\n* if two words overlap on a letter (they both use it), combine both indexes with lowest number first. Example, if hello (index 1) and heros (index 2) both share the `h`, mark that spot with `12`\n\nSo if you found a five letter word going straight across, if that word appeared first in the list, replace it with: `[1,1,1,1,1]` (that word's index)\n\nFor example, given the following:\n```\n[\n  [a,n,c,p,x],\n  [w,r,u,o,f],\n  [o,e,r,s,q],\n  [r,d,x,a,i],\n  [d,n,i,f,y]\n]\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n[\"word\", \"array\", \"find\", \"four\"]\n```\n\nthe output should be:\n```\n[\n  [2,0,0,0,0],\n  [1,24,4,4,4],\n  [1,0,2,0,0],\n  [1,0,0,2,0],\n  [13,3,3,3,2]\n]\n\n```\n\n### Other info\n* Words can be horizontal, vertical, and diagonal.\n* Word will only appear from top to bottom, bottom to top, or left to right, right to left. Your program should be able to find backwards words.\n* Words lengths will be 3 to 5 letters\n* All words will be lowercase\n",
