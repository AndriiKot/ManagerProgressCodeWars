  "description": "# Task\nA fuse melts when a current in an electrical device exceeds the fuse's rating, breaking the circuit and preventing the heat from building up too much (which can cause a fire). The ideal fuse to choose is **not lower than** than the device's current output, yet **as close as possible** to it as well.\n\nGiven an array of *fuse ratings*, and the *device's current output*, return which of the fuses is the best for the device.\n\n### Examples\n```\nchooseFuse([\"3A\", \"5A\", \"12A\"], \"4.5A\") ➞ \"5A\"\n\nchooseFuse([\"5A\", \"14A\", \"2A\"], \"5.5A\") ➞ \"14A\"\n\nchooseFuse([\"17A\", \"15A\", \"12A\"], \"9A\") ➞ \"12A\"\n```\n\n### Notes\n- Fuses may not be in a sorted order.\n- Assume that there is a valid fuse in every test case",
