  "description": "You have been appointed as a software engineer in a Marine Patrol Bureau. On your first day, your superior has assigned you a task to write a function to relay the ship's distress signals to the concerned department.\n\n## Kata\nYour objective - if choose to accept - is to write the function `decodeDistressSignal(signal)` to decode the distress signal into human-readable `string` and return it.\n\n### Input\nThe parameter provided is a `string` representing a distress signal which consists of 3 parts viz. `shipcode`, `ship_coordinates`, and `distress_codes` which are separated by the letter '-'.\n\nYour output should be in the follwing format:  \n`Distress from 'shipcode' at 'coords' for: decoded_codes`\n\n### Examples\n\n```\n#1  \ninput: 86529-113°0'0\"E:51°0'0\"S-SIS\noutput => Distress from '86529' at '113°0'0\"E:51°0'0\"S' for: 'Ship is Sinking'\n\n#2  \ninput: 376-69°0'0\"E:11°0'0\"S-SIS,MUR\n=> Distress from '376' at '69°0'0\"E:11°0'0\"S' for: 'Ship is Sinking' and 'Murder'\n    \n#3  \ninput: 7105-50°0'0\"W:40°0'0\"N-FIR,MUR,HRC,SIS\n=> Distress from '7105' at '50°0'0\"W:40°0'0\"N' for: 'Fire in the Ship', 'Murder', 'Hurricane' and 'Ship is Sinking'\n```\n\n__Remember__,\n- Decoded distress codes should be joined by `', '` string except for the last two which should be joined by `' and '`, instead.\n    \n### Distress Codes and Messages\nThis is already preloaded in the initial solution. So no need to copy and paste.\n\n    'CID': 'Captain is Dead',\n    'ICE': 'Collision with Iceberg',\n    'FIR': 'Fire in the Ship',\n    'MUR': 'Murder',\n    'SIS': 'Ship is Sinking',\n    'TXL': 'Toxic Leakage',\n    'OLL': 'Oil Leakage',\n    'WRL': 'Water Leakage',\n    'HRC': 'Hurricane',\n    'KIJ': 'Kaiju Attack',\n    'RYR': 'Royal Rumble between Workers',\n    'PIR': 'Followed by Pirates',\n    'JSN': 'Jason in the Ship',\n    'SMF': 'System Malfunction'\n    \n### Notes\n- All inputs are valid",
