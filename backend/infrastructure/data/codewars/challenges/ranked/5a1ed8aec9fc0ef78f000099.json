  "description": "We are the most disorganized TV channel in the world!!! \n\nWe need your help, please!\n\nWe present a television show, and at the begging we show the hours in a \"paper analogic advanced display\". But our show must start earlier as possible, and sometimes we don't have some many digits to present.\n\nSo...\n\nI MUST show the hours in the begging of a show, but I have just fews numbers to organized my \"paper\" display.\n\nImagine that I have the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nHow earlier our show can start?\n\nOk, ok! I'm using 24 hours clock, we do not use AM or PM...\n\nSo, my show can start at 12:34:56.\n\nI need show a valid hour, and we must use all papers in the \"screen\".\n\nIf there is no valid hour, just return \"NOT_NOW\".",
