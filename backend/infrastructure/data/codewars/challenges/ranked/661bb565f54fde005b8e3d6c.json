  "description": "# Task\n\nGiven a string `s` representing a 2D rectangular grid with rows separated by `'\\n'`, empty tiles as `'.'`, the starting point `'p'` and a path from this point using arrows in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood\">Moore neighborhood</a> `'←↑→↓↖↗↘↙'`, return a string depicting that **same path**, but with the following transformation:\n- the initial path has starting point `'p'` and for each next tile an arrow showing the **in-bound** direction\n- the transformed path must show the **out-bound** direction instead, and the final position as `'q'`\n\nConstraints:\n- There's at least 1 element in the path\n- Since the initial path shows in-bound direction, `'p'` is always shown, `'q'` never\n- Since the expected path shows out-bound direction, `'p'` is never shown, `'q'` always\n- A path is deterministic, no forks, joins or conflicts are possible\n- A path can cross with itself as long no tile is visited more than once (see third example below)\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n```\ntest    input              output\n----------------------------------\n\n1       p                   q\n\n2       ...p→→→...          ...→→→q...\n\n3       ↖↗                  ↓q\n        ↓p                  ↗↖\n\n4       ↑p                  q↓\n        ↑↓                  ↑↓\n        ←↓                  ↑←\n\n5       .↑.                 .↘.\n        p→↘                 →↑↓\n        ←←↓                 q←←\n\n6       .....↗→→→..         .....→→→↓..\n        .p→.↑↖..↓..         .→↘.↗q..↙..\n        ...↘→.←↙...         ...→↑.↖←...\n\n```\n\n---\n\nGood luck, have fun!",
