  "description": "We want to find the area of a set of buildings stacked close to each other.\n\nA matrix (an array of arrays) gives us a description of the building from above, where each number represents the height expressed in cubes `1*1*1`, the cubes are stacked adjacent to each other.\n\nFor example:  \n```\nmatrix = [[2,1],[2,0]] \n\nIn position (0,0), there are 2 cubes stacked on each other\nIn position (0,1), there is only 1 cube\nIn position (1,0), there are 2 cubes stacked on each other\nIn position (1,1), there are 0 cubes stacked on each other.\n\nSo, the total covered area is 20.\n```\n\nThe matrix will be of at least size `1*1` and square.\n\n**Note: The floor of the building counts as area as well.**",
