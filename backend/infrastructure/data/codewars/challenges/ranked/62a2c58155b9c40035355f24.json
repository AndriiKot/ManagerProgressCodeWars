  "description": "Story:\n\nMy English teacher grades our Reading Comprehension Paper with content marks and tallies.\n\nEvery question, she awards us some number of content marks and tallies.\n\n2 tallies = 1 content mark\n\nSo every tally you get decreases your score by 0.5 and every content mark increases you score by 1.\n\nBut sometimes, my score for a question is less than 0!\n\nIn that case, my teacher will award 0 marks for than question.\n\nTask:\n\nYou are given a list for each question in the Reading Comprehension of any length.\n\nFormat: [```[no. of content marks, no. of tallies], ..., [no. of content marks, no. of tallies]```]\n\nJust return the ```number of marks``` I got in the paper.\n\n```[[1, 1], [1, 3], [5, 1]] returns 5```\n\n```[[3, 5], [4, 2]] returns 3.5```\n\nRules:\n\n- You must do it in one line only\n- Must be less than 50 characters\n\n\nP.S. I am still in primary/elementary school just in case you were wondering why I was using present tense.\n",
