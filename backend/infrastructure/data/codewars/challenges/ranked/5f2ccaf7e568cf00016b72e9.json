  "description": "On a digital clock showing `00:00` to `23:59` and given a start time and end time at [unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) integers as seconds elapsed since the epoch at 00:00:00 UTC Thursday, 1 January 1970, return the number of instances where the clock will will display exactly 3 of the same integer.\n\nFor example:\n```ruby\n# function returns 0 because the clock would have only read 00:00 and there are 4 of the same integer\nthree_identical_digits(0, 0)\n#=> 0\n\n# function returns 1 because the clock would have read 00:01 and there are exactly 3 0s\nthree_identical_digits(60, 60)\n#=> 1\n\n# function returns 1 because the clock would have read 00:01 for the entire duration and there are exactly 3 0s\nthree_identical_digits(65, 77)\n#=> 1\n\n# function returns 1 because the clock would have read both 00:00 and 00:01 for the entire duration and there are exactly 3 0s in the 2nd time on the clock\nthree_identical_digits(59, 77)\n#=> 1\n\n# function returns 2 because the clock would have read 00:00, 00:01, and 00:02 for the entire duration and there are exactly 3 0s in the 2nd and 3rd time on the clock\nthree_identical_digits(59, 125)\n#=> 2\n\n# function returns 76 because the clock would have 76 instances where the clock would display exactly 3 of the same integer in a 24 hour period\nthree_identical_digits(0, 86_340)\n#= 76\n\n# function returns 152 because the clock would have 152 instances where the clock would display exactly 3 of the same integer in the 48 hour period of the day before the epoch and the day after the epoch\nthree_identical_digits(-86_400, 86_340)\n#= 152\n```\n\n",
