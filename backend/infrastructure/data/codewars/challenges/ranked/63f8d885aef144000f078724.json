  "description": "You are given an array of `Iterator` objects each sorted ascending with provided `Comparator`. Build a composite `Iterator` that yields combined content sorted same way.\n\n#### Constraints\n - there may be at most `100000` source iterators\n - there may be no source iterators at all\n - iterators may or may not be empty\n - iterators may or may not be infinite\n - elements may repeat\n - source and output iterators are supposed to be read-only\n \n#### Performance constraints\n - random finite tests have timeout of 1s (max 100000 elements split randomly between 100000 iterators)\n - infinite iterators are tested by polling considerably large amount of elements\n - fixed infinite tests have timeout of 0.1s (longest has 10000 iterators, ~1000 elements)\n - random infinite tests have timeout of 5s (max 500000 elements between 100000 iterators)\n",
