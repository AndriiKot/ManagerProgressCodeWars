  "description": "# Find backwards duplicates (Semordnilaps)\n\nA Semordnilap is a word that spells another word when spelled in reverse. For example...\n\n- `dog` spelled backwards is `god`\n- `desserts` spelled backwards is `stressed`\n\n## The Task\n\nGiven a list of words, find all the semordnilap pairs and return them as a list of tuples.\n\nBoth the words in the pair should be returned in the list. For example if \"god\" and \"dog\" were found, they should both be returned in a tuple `(\"dog\", \"god\")`\n\nThe list of tuples returned should be ordered in alphabetical order i.e `[(\"flog\", \"golf\"), (\"gum\", \"mug\")]`\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\nsemordnilap([])                                         # returns []\nsemordnilap([\"hello\", \"world\"])                         # returns [] - as no semordnilaps are present\nsemordnilap([\"dog\", \"turtle\", \"god\", \"pillow\"])         # returns [(\"dog\", \"god\")]\nsemordnilap([\"gum\"])                                    # returns [] as it's matching word \"mug\" is NOT in the list\nsemordnilap([\"golf\", \"mug\", \"gum\", \"flog\"])             # returns [(\"flog\", \"golf\"), (\"gum\", \"mug\")]\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- The list of words provided will always have unique items, i.e you don't need to worry about palindromes or duplicate words\n- All words will be lowercase, so all the words you return should also be lowercase",
