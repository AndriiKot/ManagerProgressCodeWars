  "description": "<h3>Electronics #1. Ohm's Law</h3>\nThis is based on Ohm's Law: V = IR\n<br>being: \n<br>V: Voltage in volts (V) \n<br>I: Current in amps (A) \n<br>R: Resistance in ohms (R)\n<h3>Task</h3>\nCreate a function ohms_law(s) that has an input string. \n<br>Your get a string in the form: \n<br>'2R 10V' or '1V 1A' for example. \n<br>Each value of magnitude in the string will be expressed in 'V', 'A' or 'R' \n<br>Each value is separated by a space bar in the string. \n<br>You must return a string with the value of missing magnitude followed by the unit ('V', 'A', 'R').\n<br>That value will be rounded to six (6) decimals.\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n'25V 1e-2A' --> '2500.0R' \n<br>'2200R 5V' --> '0.002273A' \n<br>'3.3e-3A 1e3R' --> '3.3V'\n<h3>Inputs</h3>\nAll inputs will be valid, no need to check them.\n",
