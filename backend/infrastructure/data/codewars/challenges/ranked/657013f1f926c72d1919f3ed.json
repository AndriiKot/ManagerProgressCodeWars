  "description": "Pinduoduo (PDD) is a popular shopping app in China that offers a unique feature: invite friends to help you bargain for a product. If enough friends join, you could get the item for free! However, the chances of reaching 100% progress and getting the item for free are slim, even with a large number of invited friends (unless you are The Chosen One). \n\nHere’s a typical progress chart:\n| Invited Friends | Progress |\n|---|---|\n| 1 | 95% |\n| 2 | 97% |\n| 3 | 98% |\n| 4 | 98.5% |\n| 5 | 98.8% |\n| ... | ... |\n| 10 | 99% |\n| 100 | 99.9% |\n| 10000 | 99.99% |\n| ... | ... |\n\nThe PDD function takes an integer input (0,2147483647), representing the count of invited friends, and returns a double output (0,1), representing the progress towards getting the item for free. The return value increases monotonically with the input parameter.\n\nP.S.: The progress chart provided is just an illustrative example and does not need to be strictly adhered to.",
