  "description": "# Highest Farkle Score\nGiven an array of dice values, calculate the highest possible farkle score for that roll\n\n# Farkle Scoring Rules\nFarkle is a game played with dice. You roll 5 dice (other numbers of dice are used in some variations) and you score points based on what you roll:\n- Each 1\t100\n- Each 5\t50\n- Three 1s\t1000\n- Three 2s\t200\n- Three 3s\t300\n- Three 4s\t400\n- Three 5s\t500\n- Three 6s\t600\nAny dice that is used for points in some way cannot be used again for other points i.e. if you use 3 ones to score 1000, you cannot also count them individually for 100 pts each.\n\n# Examples\n[1,2,3,4,5] - Here we have 100 pts for the 1 & 50 pts for the 5, for a total of 150 pts\n[1,3,3,3,6] - Here we have 300 pts for the three threes, and 100 pts for the 1, for a total of 400 pts\n[3,5,5,5,5] - Here we have 500 pts for three of the 5s, and 50 pts for the other 5 for a total of 550. Notice that each 5 scored individually would only add up to 200 pts, but we want to find the highest possible farkle score from the dice values\n[1,6,3,4,5,5,3,2,1,2,3,2] - Here we have 200 pts for the 1s, 200 pts for the 2s, 300 pts for the 3s, & 100 pts for the 5s, for a total of 800 pts\n\n# Notes\n- some variations of the game use different numbers of dice, so be prepared to handle arrays of any length 1-100\n- the input parameter will always be a valid array of length >= 1\n- standard six-sided dice will be used, no need to handle any numbers outside that range",
