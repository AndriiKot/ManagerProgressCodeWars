  "description": "### **The Cipher**\n1. Take every letter in the one-word message and replace it with its place in the alphabet.:\n2. For each number in the list, multiply it by 3 and subtract 5. Repeat this process *n* times.\n\n## Task\nImplement two functions, `encrypt()` and `decrypt()`.\n#### `encrypt()` (details):\n* Input: \n    * word - a word\n    * n - the key\n* Output:\n    * *word* encrypted with ***The Cipher***\n* Examples:\n    * `n = 2: \"abc\" >> [1, 2, 3] >> [-2, 1, 4] >> [-11, -2, 7]`\n    * `n = 6: \"test\" >> [12760, 1825, 12031, 12760]`\n    * `n = 3: \"hi\" >> [151, 178]`\n\n#### `decrypt()` (details):\n* Input:\n    * encrypted_word - A word that got encrypted with ***The Cipher***\n    * n - the key\n* Output:\n    * *encrypted_word*, decrypted\n* Examples:\n    * `n = 2: [16, 25, 34] >> [7, 10, 13] >> \"def\"`\n    * `n = 5: [1339, 610, 2311, 2311, 3040] >> \"hello\"`\n\n### Notes\nAll the inputs in the test cases are valid, i. e. for `encrypt()` only lowercase letters and for `decrypt()` only lists that were actually encrypted by my own encrypt() function.\nIf *n* is negative, just treat it as if it were 0.\nCredits to 2021 Gauss Grade 7",
