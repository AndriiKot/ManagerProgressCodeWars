  "description": "# Description\nYou are going on a trip with your friends, and you want to keep a record of all the expenses during the trip in order to share the cost equally.\n\n# Task\nCreate a class called `TripCost` that takes a list of `people` consisting of individuals who were part of the trip. \n\nYour class should have a method called `add` which takes two parameters: `person`, representing the name of the person, and `amount_spent`, representing the amount spent by that person during the trip. \n\nThe method should return a string containing the information of the cost divided equally among the participants.\n\nIf everyone has paid equal amount during the trip, your function should return `name1 has already paid their cost\\nname2 has already paid their cost` with names in sorted order.\n\n# Example\n```\ntrip1 = TripCost(['Ali', 'Walid', 'Ken', 'Clark', 'Sid', 'Laura', 'Maya']\n\ntrip1.add('Aqsa', 10) # Aqsa was not part of the trip\n\ntrip1.add('Ali', -5) # Spent amount should be greater than zero\n\ntrip1.add('Ali', 14) \n# Ali has paid $14 for the trip, and there are 7 people on the trip. Therefore, the amount to be divided equally among everyone is $14/7 = $2. Ali should receive a refund of $12 ($14 - $2), and everyone else should contribute $2.\n\n$12 to be paid to Ali\nClark has to pay $2\nKen has to pay $2\nLaura has to pay $2\nMaya has to pay $2\nSid has to pay $2\nWalid has to pay $2\n\ntrip2 = TripCost(['Ali', 'Walid'])\n\ntrip2.add('Ali', 10) \n$5 to be paid to Ali\nWalid has to pay $5\n\ntrip2.add('Walid', 10), \nAli has already paid their cost\nWalid has already paid their cost\n\n```\n\n# Sorting\nThe final result should include the individuals with the `highest payable amount` to them, listed in decreasing order. \n\nThis should be followed by the individuals with the `lowest amount to be paid` by them in increasing order. \n\nIf multiple individuals have the same amount to be paid, they should be sorted based on their `names`.\n\n# Notes\n- 2 < people <= 20",
