  "description": "A common way to teach children how to code is to let them program a robot with a very limited set of instructions, which are executed in an endless loop.\n\nIn our case, you have to help a little robot by finding the correct set of instructions, so it can cross a dangerous area with holes. \n\nThe robot starts in the upper left corner and has to leave the area either on the right or the down side.\n\nThe robot can only handle two types of instructions: \n- move one tile to the right: ```R``` \n- move one tile down: ```D``` \n\nIts memory is limited, therefore the number of instructions you can provide is limited ```max_instructions```.\n\nAfter the end of the instructions is reached, the program starts at the beginning.\n\nThe solution can be shorter than the maximum number of instructions.\n\nThe area you have to cross is provided as a new line separated string. ```F``` denotes a movable tile, ```H``` denotes a hole, which will kill your robot, if it moves onto it. The field is always quadratic.\n\nYour solution should provide the program for the robot as string.\n\nAll test cases have at least one solution.\n\n### Input\n```field``` the field your robot has to pass.\n\n```max_instructions``` the maximum number of instructions the robot can handle\n\n### Output\nString containing the instructions ```R``` and ```D```\n\nA very similar challenge can be found at https://www.hacker.org/runaway/\n\nThere is also version with higher perfomance requirements of this kata available: [Program the robot (performance)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/62cb28bfd32bd6184fd500fe/)",
