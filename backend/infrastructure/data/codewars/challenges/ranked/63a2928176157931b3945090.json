  "description": "You are walking on the sidwalk, you notice your friend is also walking on the sidewalk. You need to give a shout to your friend in order to grab their attention.\n\n## Kata\n\nWrite the function `madShout` that takes a string input `sidewalk` to calculate the shout `string` and return it.\n\nThe shout phrase is `\"Oi F!\"` but depending on the distance between your friend, the word expands.\n\n## Example for input 'sidewalk'\n\n    '---------Y-----F------------'\n    \n    Y = You\n    F = Friend\n\n### 'Shout' phrase:\nSince in the example, the difference between the friends is `6` (F's index is 15 & that of Y's is 9), the shout phrase becomes `'Oiii F!'`\n    \n#### Consider the following differences and its output:\n    Difference is 4 => 'Oii F!'\n    2 => 'Oi F!'\n    9 => 'Oiiiii F!'\n    0 => 'Oi F!'\n    1 => 'Oi F!'\n    20 => 'Oiiiiiiiiii F!'\n\n### Some guides for coding\n1. `Y` will always be on the left and `F` will be on the right.\n2. The number of 'i's in the output must be `>= 1`\n3. All the inputs are valid.",
