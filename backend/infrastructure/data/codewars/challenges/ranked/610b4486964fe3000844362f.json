  "description": "# Highest Sum of Increasing Sequence with Same Jump\n\nGiven an array of size **N**, you must return the greatest sum of all increasing sequences with the same jump inbetween each number.\n\nFor example given the array `[68,71,93,43,73,13,25,96,83,37]`.  \nThe longest increasing sequences with the same jump are  \n`[68,71,93]` with a jump of **1** and a sum of **232**,  \n`[13,25,96]` with a jump of **1** and a sum of **134** and  \n`[71,73,96]` with a jump of **3** and a sum of **240**.  \nso you would return **240** as that is the largest sum of the 3\n\ngiven the array `[0,13,28,73,66,57,49,2,48,25]`.  \nThe longest increasing sequence with the same jump is `[0,13,28,73]` with a jump of **1**  \nSo the sum of this would be **114**  \nSo you would return **114**\n\n**For an extra challenge:** try and keep space complexity under O(n) and time complexity under O(n^2)",
