  "description": "Write a `Traversable` instance for the following type of Rose Trees which traverses the tree in breadth-first order.\n\n```haskell\ndata Tree a = a :& [Tree a] deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Functor)\n```\n\nYour instance should be law-abiding.\n\nAn automatically derived implementation of `Traversable` performs the effects in depth-first order.\n\nFor instance, take the following example tree:\n\n```haskell\nexampleTree\n  =\n    1 :&\n      [ 2 :&\n          [ 5 :&\n              [ 9  :& []\n              , 10 :& []]\n          , 6 :& []]\n      , 3 :& []\n      , 4 :&\n          [ 7 :&\n              [ 11 :& []\n              , 12 :& []]\n          , 8 :& []]]\n```\n\nCalling `bft print exampleTree` should print out the numbers 1 to 12 in order.\n\nYou may replace the `Foldable` instance if you like: currently it simply derives the instance from the `Traversable` instance.
