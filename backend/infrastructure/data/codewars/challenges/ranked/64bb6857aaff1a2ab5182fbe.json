  "description": "# Task\nA certain security system is responsible for maintaining a `code` capable of generating a key for each respective lock `key = code % lock` .This security system has a key (`main_key`) and its respective lock (`main_lock`) that are fixed and serve as a base to update all the others. To maintain security, after a certain lock is accessed 10 times with the wrong key they update its lock value `lock = lock + main_key`.\n\nA hacker was able to steal the `main_key` and the `main_lock` but he has no idea what the `code` is. \n\nWrite a function that returns how many attempts the hacker needs to be sure he is able to find certain lock key, if that is impossible return `\"System with a high level of security.\"`\n\n- Will be provided: main_key, main_lock and lock_x (the one you have to find how many attempts to figure the key_x).\n\n# Examples\n```\nhack(1, 2, 8) ➞ 4\n# With only four attempts it is possible to access the lock.\n\nhack(1, 2, 13) ➞ 17\n\nhack(5, 101, 111) ➞ 996\n\nhack(10, 101, 111) ➞ \"System with a high level of security.\"\n```",
