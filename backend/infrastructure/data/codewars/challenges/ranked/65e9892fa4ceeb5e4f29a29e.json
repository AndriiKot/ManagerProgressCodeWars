  "description": "This is the first in a series of katas about a letter-placement puzzle known as edgewords.\n\nAn Edgeword puzzle positions pairs of letters on  the outer 8 squares of a 3 x 3 grid to form four six-letter words.\n\nFor example, given the eight two-letter tiles\n\n```LA - WN - MB - ZE - DA - RO - MA - ED```\n\nWe could lay them out in a square like this:\n\n```\nLA-MB-DA\nMA    WN\nZE-RO-ED\n```\n\nThis first kata in the series is simple.  Given a single six-letter word, write code which returns an array of two-letter sequences which can be combined to make up that word.\n\nSo, for example, the word\n\n```BARBER```\n\nwould result in the array\n\n```['BA','RB', 'ER']```, \n\nwhile\n\n```CANARY```\n\nwould result in the array\n\n```['CA', 'NA', 'RY']```\n\nAll words used in testing will give valid results, and all words are valid English words, so there's no need for any checking.",
