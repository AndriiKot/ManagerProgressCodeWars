  "description": "## Description\nYou are given four tuples. In each tuple there is coordinates x and y of a point. There is one and only one line, that goes through two points, so with four points you can have two lines: first and second tuple is two points of a first line, thirs and fourth tuple is two points of the second line. Your task is to find and return a tuple with x and y coordinates of lines crossing point.\n\nNumbers can be positive as well as negative, integer or floats. Your answer shouldn't be rounded!!\n\nNote, that if two lines are the same ( have infinite crossing points ) or parallel ( have no crossing points ), you will need to return `None`/`Nothing` depending on language.\n\n![Example on graphic](https://justpaste.it/img/a6760541d86f232527c516f6882c28dc.png \"Example on graphic\")\n\n## Examples\n``` python\nfind_the_crossing((5,3), (10,4), (5,7.5), (10,7)) => (20, 6) #from the graphic above\nfind_the_crossing((5,3), (10,4), (20,6), (0,2)) => None #edge case for two identical lines\nfind_the_crossing((5,3), (10,4), (5,5), (10,6)) => None #edge case for two parallel lines \n```\n``` haskell\n>>> findTheCrossing (5,3) (10,4) (5,7.5) (10,7)\nJust (20, 6) -- from the graphic above\n>>> findTheCrossing (5,3) (10,4) (20,6) (0,2)\nNothing -- edge case for two identical lines\n>>> findTheCrossing (5,3) (10,4) (5,5) (10,6)\nNothing -- edge case for two parallel lines \n```\n## Tests\nThere will be example tests, random tests and tests on big numbers.\n\n**Example tests** are pre programmed tests for debugging.\n\n**Random tests** are generated randomly, where ```-1000 ≤ x ≤ 1100```. There is still will some with parallel and identical lines.\n\n**Tests on big numbers** are random tests where ```-1000000000 ≤ x ≤ 1000000000```",
