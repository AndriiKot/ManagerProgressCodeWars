  "description": "We all know what happens when we flip a coin. We get either heads, or tails. But what happens when we flip 2 coins? Now there are 2^2 possible combinations. 3 produces 2^3 combinations.\n\nIn general, n coin flips produces 2^n possible scenarios.\n\nYour task will be to generate all the possible combinations and return them.\n\nGood luck.\n\nLimits: 0 <= n <= 10",
