  "description": "## Background\n\n[Unix Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) Stamp is a date and time representation widely used in computing.\n\nIt measures time by the number of non-leap seconds that have elapsed since `00:00:00 UTC on 1st January 1970`.\n\nIn modern computing, values are sometimes stored with higher granularity, such as microseconds or nanoseconds (In this kata, you just need to be accurate to the `second`).\n\n\n## Task\n\nComplete the function to convert the given time to unix time stamp.\n\n#### Notes\n\n- Leap days should be taken into account\n- `import` is disabled in Python\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\n[1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]       -->  0\n[2001, 9, 9, 1, 46, 40]     -->  1000000000\n[2345, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]      -->  11847456550\n[9999, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59]  -->  253402300799\n```\n\n## Input/Output\n\n- Type of input : `List/Array/Table` (Depends on language)\n- Elements : `[Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second]`\n- Range : `[1970-9999, 1-12, 1-31, 0-23, 0-59, 0-59]`\n- All inputs are valid\n\n\n## For translators\n\nFunctions that directly complete kata should be disable in all languages",
