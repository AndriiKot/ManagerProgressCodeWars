  "description": "\n### Article Reference\n\nFor a detailed explanation of the underlying concepts, you can refer to [this article](https://mathcenter.oxford.emory.edu/site/math125/rationalEnumeration/#:~:text=Theorem%3A,the%20sets%20can%20be%20found). It provides an in-depth look at the topic and is highly recommended for further reading.\n\n## Introduction\n\nYou've likely heard the phrase *some infinities are bigger than others*. While most just hear it once and then parrot it out without understanding it, its true meaning is a fascinating topic in mathematics, particularly when exploring proofs and set theory.\n\nToday, we will explore a proof that the set of natural numbers, denoted `$\\mathbb{N}$`, has the same cardinality (size) as the set of rational numbers, denoted `$\\mathbb{Q}$`.\n\nTo demonstrate that two sets have the same cardinality, we need to establish a bijection between them. Therefore, our task is to enumerate `$\\mathbb{Q}$`.\n\nWe use the following sequence to achieve this:\n\n![sequence](https://imgur.com/xhObQTv.png)\n\nStarting at `1`, for all `$n \\in \\mathbb{N}$`, there exists a corresponding fraction in `$\\mathbb{Q}$`. This sequence will eventually cover **every rational number**.\n\nHowever, for a bijection to exist, the mapping must be **injective**, meaning it cannot have **repeated elements**. Consequently, we skip any **reducible fractions** such as `(2, 2)` or `(6, 3)`. This gives us the sequence:\n\n```python\n1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 1/3, 3/1, 1/4, 2/3, 3/2, 4/1, 1/5, 5/1, ...\n```\n\nTo be honest, this only proves that `$\\mathbb{N}$` has the same cardinality as `$\\mathbb{Q_+^*}$`. However, an experienced reader should be able to conclude the proof without much hassle.\n\n## Task\n\nGiven a **positive integer** `n`, return the `n`th term of this sequence.\n\nThere's a very big optimisation requirement for this challenge, so you're expected to improve almost every aspect of your solution.\nDo note that:\n\n- An optimal solution should be able to complete the tests consistently, even if that takes most of the available time.\n\n- All expected optimisations are algorithmic; thus, no major implementation details should be important.\n\n```python\nRandom Tests: 115\nInput Range: 1 <= n <= 1e12\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n```python\n1 -> (1, 1)\n2 -> (1, 2)\n3 -> (2, 1)\n5 -> (3, 1)\n7 -> (2, 3)\n10 -> (1, 5)\n```\n",
