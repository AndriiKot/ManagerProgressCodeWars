  "description": "I often find that I end up needing to write a function to return multiple values, in this case I would often split it up into two different functions but then I have to spend time thinking of a new function name! Wouldn't it be great if I could use same name for a function again and again...\n\nIn this kata your task is to make a decorator, `FuncAdd` which will allow function names to be reused and when called all functions with that name will be called (in order) and the results returned as a tuple.\n\n```python\n@FuncAdd\ndef foo():\n    return 'Hello'\n\n@FuncAdd\ndef foo():\n    return 'World'\n\nfoo() --> ('Hello', 'World')\n```\nAs well as this you will have to implement two more things, a way of deleting a particular function, and a way of deleting all stored functions. The `delete` method must work as follows:\n```python\n@FuncAdd\ndef foo():\n    return 'Hello'\n    \nFuncAdd.delete(foo) # Delete all foo() functions only\nfoo() # Should raise NameError\n```\nAnd the `clear` method must work like this:\n```python\n@FuncAdd\ndef foo():\n    return 'Hello'\n    \nFuncAdd.clear() # Delete all decorated functions\nfoo() # Should raise NameError\n```\nThe functions must also accept args and kwargs which would all be passed to every function.",
