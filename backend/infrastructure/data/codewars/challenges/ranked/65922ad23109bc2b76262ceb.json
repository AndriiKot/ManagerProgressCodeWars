  "description": "Two codewars players (codewardians?) want to create a `n by m` poster to advertise their kata. However, it must follow a few requirements.\n - The poster is a 2d array of characters\n - The characters can only contain the lower case English alphabet `a - z`\n - The poster must contain `x` horizontal palindromes\n - The poster must contain `y` vertical palindromes \n \n<br> \n\nEvery letter in a row (left to right) or column (top to down) will form a string. It will only be counted as a palindrome if the entire row/column is a palindrome. For example, `tacocat` is a palindrome whereas `karma` and `array` are not. \n\nBecause the players are obviously hungry for online cookie points, the poster must not contain more or less than `x` and `y` palindromes.\n\nYour job is to create a poster that fulfils their requirements.\n\n### Input\nYou will be given `n` and `m` which are the dimensions of the poster, `x` and `y` which indicate the number of horizontal and vertical palindromes respectively\n\n### Output\nIf it is impossible to create a poster that meets the requirements, output `null/None/Nil` \n\nOtherwise, you will return a `n` by `m` 2d character array that follows the requirements. \n\n### Sample 1\n\nInput: `n = 4, m = 5, x = 1, y = 2`\n\nOutput (will vary):\n```\nhonor\nlevel\ncivil\nowner\n```\n\n`level` is a horizontal palindrome. `nvvn` and `rllr` are two vertical palindromes\n\n\n### Sample 2\n\nInput: `n = 2, m = 2, x = 2, y = 1`\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nImpossible\nNo poster can be made with the given inputs; Output null/None/Nil\n```\n\nConstraints: `2 <= m, n <= 200` and `0 <= x, y <= m, n`\nIMPORTANT: The lowest constraint for `m, n` is `2`\n",
