  "description": "You have to build a pyramid.<br>\n<br>\nThis pyramid should be built from characters from a given string.<br>\n<br>\nYou have to create the code for these four methods:\n```csharp\npublic static string WatchPyramidFromTheSide(string characters)\n\npublic static string WatchPyramidFromAbove(string characters)\n\npublic static int CountVisibleCharactersOfThePyramid(string characters)\n\npublic static int CountAllCharactersOfThePyramid(string characters)\n```\n```java\npublic static String watchPyramidFromTheSide(String characters)\n\npublic static String watchPyramidFromAbove(String characters)\n\npublic static int countVisibleCharactersOfThePyramid(String characters)\n\npublic static int countAllCharactersOfThePyramid(String characters)\n```\n```javascript\nfunction watchPyramidFromTheSide(characters)\n\nfunction watchPyramidFromAbove(characters)\n\nfunction countVisibleCharactersOfThePyramid(characters)\n\nfunction countAllCharactersOfThePyramid(characters)\n```\n```cpp\nstd::string watchPyramidFromTheSide(std::string characters)\n\nstd::string watchPyramidFromAbove(std::string characters)\n\nint countVisibleCharactersOfThePyramid(std::string characters)\n\nint countAllCharactersOfThePyramid(std::string characters)\n```\n```python\nwatch_pyramid_from_the_side(characters):\n\nwatch_pyramid_from_above(characters):\n\ncount_visible_characters_of_the_pyramid(characters):\n\ncount_all_characters_of_the_pyramid(characters):\n```\n\nThe first method (\"FromTheSide\") shows the pyramid as you would see from the side.<br>\nThe second method (\"FromAbove\") shows the pyramid as you would see from above.<br>\nThe third method (\"CountVisibleCharacters\") should return the count of all characters, that are visible from outside the pyramid.<br>\nThe forth method (\"CountAllCharacters\") should count all characters of the pyramid. Consider that the pyramid is completely solid and has no holes or rooms in it.<br>\n\nEvery character will be used for building one layer of the pyramid. So the length of the given string will be the height of the pyramid. Every layer will be built with stones from the given character. There is no limit of stones.<br>\nThe pyramid should have perfect angles of 45 degrees.<br>\n<br><br>\nExample: <b>Given string: \"abc\"</b><br>\n<br>\nPyramid from the side:<br>\n```\n  c\n bbb\naaaaa\n```\nPyramid from above:<br>\n```\naaaaa\nabbba\nabcba\nabbba\naaaaa\n```\nCount of visible stones/characters: \n```\n25\n```\nCount of all used stones/characters:\n```\n35\n```\n<br>\nThere is no meaning in the order or the choice of the characters. It should work the same for example \"aaaaa\" or \"54321\".\n<br>\n<b>Hint:</b> Your output for the side must always be a rectangle! So spaces at the end of a line must not be deleted or trimmed!\n<br>\nIf the string is null or empty, you should exactly return this value for the watch-methods and <b>-1</b> for the count-methods.\n<br><br>\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) <br>\n\nI have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.<br>",
