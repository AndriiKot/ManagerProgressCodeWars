  "description": "# Task\n\"Loves me, loves me not\" is a traditional game in which a person plucks off all the petals of a flower one by one, saying the phrase \"Loves me\" and \"Loves me not\" when determining whether the one that they love, loves them back.\n\nGiven a number of petals, return a string which repeats the phrases `\"Loves me\"` and `\"Loves me not\"` for every alternating petal, and return the last phrase in all caps. Remember to put a comma and space between phrases.\n\n# Examples\n```\nloves_me(1) ➞ \"LOVES ME\"\n\nloves_me(2), \"Loves me, LOVES ME NOT\"\n\nloves_me(3) ➞ \"Loves me, Loves me not, LOVES ME\"\n\n```\n\n# Notes\n- The first phrase is always \"Loves me\".\n- 1 <= n <= 1000",
