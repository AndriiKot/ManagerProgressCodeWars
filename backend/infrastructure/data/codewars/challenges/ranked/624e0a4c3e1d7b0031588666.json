  "description": "Although its use in screening healthy patients is debatable, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is a very useful blood test for following the response of prostate cancer to treatment.\n\nFor patients treated with radiation therapy alone for prostate cancer, the PSA tends to take 2-3 years to reach a minimum value (nadir). If the PSA begins to rise again after the nadir value, this may represent a recurrence of prostate cancer.\n\nThe 1996 ASTRO (American Society for Radiation Oncology) definition (1) of a *biochemical recurrence* is:\n3 consecutive rising PSA values after reaching the nadir value (lowest point) of the sample.\n\nYou are given a list of PSA values for one patient.\nThe list consists of 12 PSA values in ng/mL (as a float with 2 decimal places) each taken 6 months apart. The first value is taken immediately before treatment. The accuracy is two decimal points.  The nadir (minimum value) will appear only once in the list.\n\nReturn ``True`` if the values meet the ASTRO criteria (3 consecutive increases in PSA occuring any time after reaching the lowest value) or ``False`` if they do not.  \n\nFor clarity, the 3 consecutive increases may start directly from the nadir but do not have to. See examples below.\n\nExamples:\n```if:python\n    Input:\n    [7.91, 2.43, 1.49, 0.99, 0.74, 0.48, 0.52, 0.50, 0.66, 1.26, 1.36, 1.35]\n    Ouput:\n    True\n    # Nadir 0.48,  3 subsequent rises: 0.50->0.66, 0.66->1.26 , 1.26->1.36\n    \n    Input:\n    [9.98, 8.56, 4.62, 1.16, 0.26, 0.37, 0.32, 1.02, 0.99, 1.56, 1.41, 2.35]\n    Ouput:\n    False\n    # Nadir 0.26. No subsequent sequence of 3 consecutive rises. \n    \n    Input:\n    [12.57, 6.86, 1.86, 1.93, 0.60, 1.26, 0.99 ,2.1, 0.70, 0.72, 0.88, 1.9]\n    Output:\n    True\n    # Nadir 0.60, 3 subsequent consecutive rises: 0.70->0.72, 0.72->0.88, 0.88->1.9\n    \n    Input:\n    [14.66, 3.14, 0.53, 0.58, 1.00, 1.26, 0.99 ,2.1, 1.50, 2.53, 2.17, 2.50]\n    Output:\n    True\n    # Nadir 0.53.  3 subsequent consecutive rises: 0.53->0.58, 0.58->1.00, 1.00-> 1.26\n```\n\n\n(1) Cox J, Grignon D, Kaplan R, Parsons J, Schellhammer P.
