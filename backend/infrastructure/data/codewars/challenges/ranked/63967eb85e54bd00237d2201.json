  "description": "Task: concatenate one or more letters \nto the end of a given input string to\ncreate a string that reads the same \n forward as backward. \n \n Specifications\n\n* Letters can only be added to the right hand side of the input string. \n\n* You are required to add at least one letter to the input string. \n\n* The shorter return string is the correct one. ie.. (ab)=> abba is Wrong, \nwhile  (ab)=> aba is Right. \n\n* Inputs will consist of one or more letters, upper and lower case. \n\n* Strings are case sensitive. ie..(Gn)=> gng is Wrong, while (Gn)=> GnG is right. \n \n Examples: \n \n(a) => a + a => aa \n\n(GG) => GG + G => GGG \n\n(Ab) => Ab + A => AbA \n\n(aba) => aba + ba => ababa \n\n(aab) => aab + aa => aabaa \n",
