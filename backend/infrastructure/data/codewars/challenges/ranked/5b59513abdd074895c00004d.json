  "description": "There is a **Sports League**, where the committee is recording the scores of each player in every game.\n\nThe objective of this *Kata* is to determine who is the ***player*** on a particular given rank from the provided **Player Standing List**.\n\nThe rank criteria is determined depending who has the heighest score with the least number of games. In cases when there are multiple players having the same score and number of games, the ***rank*** will be determined on their position on the **Players Standing List**. \n\n**Example**:\n  \n\n    Player Standing List: 'Mike', 'Chris', 'Arnold'\n    Record Game Score: 'Mike' - 2\n    Record Game Score: 'Arnold' - 5\n    Record Game Score: 'Chris' - 5\n    Record Game Score: 'Mike' - 3\n    \n    $player1 = playerRank(1, $this->standings);  \n\n\nIn this example, The **Players Standing List** is shown as follows, `Mike`, `Chris`, `Arnold`. All players have the same score (which is **5**). Only `Arnold` and `Chris` had played only **1** game. The given rank is **1** in `playerRank(1, $this->standings)` and since `Chris` is **2**nd and `Arnold` is **3**rd in the **Players Standing List**, `Chris` is **Rank 1**.\n\n\n",
