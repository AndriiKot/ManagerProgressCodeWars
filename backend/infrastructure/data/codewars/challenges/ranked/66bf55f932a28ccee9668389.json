  "description": "**Number Guessing Game: Four-Digit Non-Repeating Digits**\n\nIn this number guessing game, the player tries to guess a secret four-digit number where all digits are unique (non-repeating). After each guess, the game provides feedback on how many digits in the guess are correct and how many of those digits are in the correct position. The game continues until the player guesses the number correctly.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Generate a Secret Number: The game randomly selects a four-digit number with non-repeating digits as the target number.\n\n2. Input Validation: The player must enter a valid four-digit number where each digit is unique. If the input is invalid (e.g., contains repeating digits or is not a four-digit number), the game prompts the player to enter a valid guess.\n\n3. Provide Feedback: After each valid guess, the game provides feedback:\n\n    Correct Numbers: The number of digits in the guess that match the target number.\n    Correct Positions: The number of digits in the guess that are in the correct position.\n    \n4. Terminate When Correct: The game ends when the player guesses the correct number. The total number of attempts is displayed.\n\n**Example Interaction**\n\nHere’s how the game might interact with the player:\n\n    Enter your guess (a 4-digit number with non-repeating digits): 1864\n    Correct numbers: 1 Correct position: 0\n    \n    Enter your guess (a 4-digit number with non-repeating digits): 2321\n    Invalid input. Please enter a 4-digit number with non-repeating digits.\n    \n    Enter your guess (a 4-digit number with non-repeating digits): 12567\n    Invalid input. Please enter a 4-digit number with non-repeating digits.\n    \n    Enter your guess (a 4-digit number with non-repeating digits): 1\n    Invalid input. Please enter a 4-digit number with non-repeating digits.\n    \n    Enter your guess (a 4-digit number with non-repeating digits): 1347\n    Correct numbers: 2 Correct position: 2\n    \n    Enter your guess (a 4-digit number with non-repeating digits): 1250\n    Correct numbers: 1 Correct position: 0\n    \n    Enter your guess (a 4-digit number with non-repeating digits): 6387\n    Correct numbers: 1 Correct position: 1\n    \n    Enter your guess (a 4-digit number with non-repeating digits): 2340\n    Correct numbers: 3 Correct position: 2\n    \n    Enter your guess (a 4-digit number with non-repeating digits): 0349\n    Correct numbers: 4 Correct position: 4\n    \n    Congratulations! You guessed the number 0349 correctly in 6 attempts!\n    \n**Explanation**\n\n  Initial Guess: The player begins by guessing a four-digit number.\n  \n  Feedback: For each guess, the game reports the number of correct digits and how many are in the correct position.\n  \n  Correct numbers: The total number of digits in the guess that are also in the target number.\n  \n  Correct position: The number of digits in the guess that are in the exact position as in the target number.\n\n  Input Validation: If the guess is not a valid four-digit number with unique digits, the player is prompted to enter a valid guess.\n\n  Game Completion: The game ends when the player guesses the correct number, and the total number of attempts is displayed.",
