  "description": "\n## Introduction\n\nIn the land of *Mathtopia*, *King Euler I* embarks on his inaugural **crusade** to purge the holy soil of *NerdLand* from the unworthy scholars of humanities, reinstating its former glory in STEM.\n\nYet, **only honorable knights** may join this esteemed quest. Thus, he must devise a scheme to discern which loyal subjects shall partake in the honor of battle.\n\nAmidst his restless nights, gazing at the stars, and pondering the likelihood of his plan's fruition, a glint of hope emerges. Beholding the night's embrace through his casement, he encounters **divine intervention**.\n\n> Only those who possess qualities akin to those of your greatest knight shall aid you; the others shall betray you.\n\nPerplexed yet invigorated, the king endeavors to **decipher** the celestial entity's words.\n\nArranging his `n` men in sequence with his most valiant placed at the end, he assigns a **numerical worth** to each, spanning from `1` to `n`. Thus, he determines that **only those whose value divides evenly into that of his foremost man** shall partake in this grand endeavor.\n\n## Task\n\nGiven a **positive integer** `n`, return **it's divisors**, sorted in **ascending order**, **without repetition** (`1` and `n` also count).\n\n## Performance\n\nThis kata's focus is to test numbers with **many of the same smaller prime factors**, such as `2 ^ 12345` or `3 ^ 420 * 7 ^ 69`, rather than numbers with **few very big prime factors**, such as `1,000,000,007` and `500,000,003`.\n\nThus, giving a **max value for** `n` would be **misleading**.\n\nHowever, I can assure you of a few things.\n\n- The **length of the output** will **always be smaller or equal to** `1,000,000`.\n- The given number will **never have a prime factor greater that** `1000`.\n- In addition to the fixed tests, there will be `100` random tests, following the **aforementioned restrictions**.\n\nAlso, **the answer won't be shown in the full tests**; this isn't to avoid cheating but rather to allow big inputs; otherwise, the string conversion for the message would **take too long**, **limiting the possible inputs**.\n\n### Length Test\n\nYour code shouldn't be longer than `10,000` characters.\n\nUnless you're trying to hardcode some of the answers, this **really shouldn't be a problem** (reference solution is `476` characters long).\n\nThis is just to stop anyone from **hardcoding some of the slower inputs**.\n\n### Examples\n\n```python\ndivisors(6) -> [1, 2, 3, 6]\ndivisors(25) -> [1, 5, 25]\ndivisors(101) -> [1, 101]\ndivisors(250) -> [1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 125, 250]\n\n# It's just the powers of 3 to 100; I ain't putting them all here, but you have to return them all.\ndivisors(3 ** 100) -> [1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, ..., 515377520732011331036461129765621272702107522001]\n```\n\n#### Other Katas\n\nCheck out https://www.codewars.com/kata/544aed4c4a30184e960010f4, for a **less performant** version of the same problem (`O(n)` works there).\n\nCheck out https://www.codewars.com/kata/5bd5607c1c730fe99400000f, for a **more big-primes-focused** version. It has a **lower upper bound**, but **greater individual factors** (the description is also `10%` of this one, lol).\n\nIf you're looking for some other **dumb math stories**, take a look at **my other katas**, though **regarding quality**, the introduction is the only certainty at best.\n",
