  "description": "You are working as a spy in an airbase during a war. On your computer, there is a list of targets. You are aware that the general will order strikes on the first few targets given to him.   \nHowever, you need to act quickly before one of his advisors provides targets that would actually harm your forces.  \nYou have the ability to compare the targets and determine which ones would have a greater or lesser impact on the war effort.  \nYour mission, if you choose to accept it, is to create a list that contains the K targets which would cause the least harm to your forces, based on the information available on your computer.\n\n# Task\nYour task is to write a function that takes an unsorted list of comparable values and a number K, representing the number of targets (ammo) to return. The function should return a list containing the K smallest values from the input list.  \n\nFor example, given the list ```[1, 5, -3, 2]``` and ```K = 2```, the function should return one of these lists: ```[-3, 1]```, ```[1, -3]```.\nfor ```k = 0``` return an empty list\n\n# Performance specifications:\n0 <= k <= length  \nsorting the input will be too slow, this is a preformance kata  \n~~~rust\nthere will be 3 tests with lists sized: 1,000,000  \nthere will be 3 tests with lists sized: 5,000,000  \nthere will be 3 tests with lists sized: 20,000,000  \n~~~  \n~~~csharp\nthere will be 1 test with a list sized: 5,000,000 \nthere will be 1 tests with lists sized: 10,000,000  \nthere will be 1 tests with lists sized: 20,000,000  \n~~~  \n\nthere will also be more tests with smaller lists\n\n~~~if:rust\nsmall note: there is a function in the standard library that solves this, so I check you don't use it in the main test :). \n~~~",
