  "description": "## Overview\n\nJack's chemistry teacher gave him piles of homework to complete in just ONE day and he just can't seem to get it done! All the questions are of the same type, making the homework both tedious and time-consuming.\n\nHe has been given the chemical formula of an element and is required to find out how many moles will be there in a given mass of that element.\n\nWill you help him write out a function to help him finish his homework?\n\n## Task\n\nWrite a function **count_the_moles** which returns the number of moles present in a given mass of a substance.\n\nYou will be given:\n\n1) The mass of substance taken (in grams)\n2) The chemical formula of that substance\n\n\n## Important Notes\n\n1) The chemical formulas will not be written with subscript:\n\ni.e, Carbon dioxide = CO2\n\n2) The substances will be very simple. The no. of atoms of each element will not exceed 9\n\ni.e, substances like sugar (C12H22O11) will not be given, but substances like carbon dioxide (CO2) will be given\n\n3) The only elements in the substance will be Carbon (atomic mass = **12u**) , Hydrogen (atomic mass = **1u**) , Nitrogen (atomic mass = **14u**) , Oxygen (atomic mass = **16u**) , Potassium (atomic mass = **39u**) , Phosphorus (atomic mass = **31u**) , Sulphur (atomic mass = **32u**) and Fluorine (atomic mass = **19u**)\n\n**All these elements are preloaded in the dictionary named atomic_masses**\n\n## Good Luck!\n\n",
