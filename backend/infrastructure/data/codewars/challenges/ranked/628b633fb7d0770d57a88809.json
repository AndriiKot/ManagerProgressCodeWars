  "description": "## OBJECTIVE:\n\nYou need to cross a certain section of the field in order to reach your target, but some cells of this field are irradiated with radiation, and you would not want to receive a large dose of radiation after completing your route.\nThe purpose of this kata is to create a function that takes a list of 10x10 cells (string type). On some of the cells there are radiation sources, which are of three types: <b><font color=\"orange\">\"A\"</font></b>, <b><font color=\"orange\">\"B\"</font></b>, <b><font color=\"orange\">\"C\"</font></b>. It is necessary to calculate the degree of contamination of each free cell (by default, all cells except radiation sources have a radiation level of \"0\") and return a list with the correct values for each cell.\n\n## DETAILS:\n\nEach type of radiation source has its own characteristics of <b>radiation propagation</b> and <b>radiation power</b>:<br>\n\n<b><font color=\"orange\">Type \"A\"</font></b> has the following feature (<b>power=1</b>):\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 A 1 0\n0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n ```\n<b><font color=\"orange\">Type \"B\"</font></b> (<b>power=2</b>):\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 2 2 B 2 2 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n ```\n<b><font color=\"orange\">Type \"C\"</font></b> (<b>power=3</b>):\n ```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 3 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 C 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 3 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n ```\n You need to take into account that when several sources act on one cell, the degree of its exposure should add up. For example, if a cell is affected by source \"A\" and source \"B\", then its degree will be equal to: (1+2)=3, and source \"B\" and \"C\": (2+3)=5.<br>\n \n<b><font color=\"orange\">For example:</font></b><br>\n ```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 5 B 2 2 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 3 C 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 A 4 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 1 4 1 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n ``` \n Sources <b>do not affect</b> each other in any way:\n ```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 1 3 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 A B 5 2 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 C 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 2 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n ```\n   If the radiation source is in such a position that some of its rays will not be displayed on the field, mark only those that are possible.<br>\n \n<b><font color=\"orange\">For example:</font></b><br>\n ```\n A 1 0 0 0 \n 1 1 0 0 0\n 0 0 0 0 0\n 0 0 0 0 0\n ```",
