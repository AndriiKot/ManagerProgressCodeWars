  "description": "## Introduction\n\nIt's **Christmas** (a bit late, I know), and you finally decide to do something nice for once in your life.\n\nAs you're going to meet up with your family, you think to give them a little something, and what's a better gift than **money**? I mean, it's kind of hard to find something that both a **geriatric** and **tiktok child** would enjoy.\n\nHowever, there's a little **problem**: you don't remember **how many people** there are in the family anymore. Among so much **breeding** and **unaliving**, it's just impossible to keep track of the **exact count**. Also, who knows if that **8th degree** cousin will show up—is that even family anymore?\n\nWell, you're at least sure of one thing. There will be, **at max**, `n` people at the gathering (excluding you). God only knows how you came up with that **upper bound**, but you did.\n\nNow, you must be sure that **everyone receives the same** amount of money; politics brings about enough discussion already.\n\nFurthermore, **no money can be left over**; they would notice and call you **greedy**.\n\nThus, you decide to bring the smallest amount of **one dollar bills**, such that **no matter how many people** show up, within your estimated range, **everyone gets the same** and **no money is left over**.\n\n## Task\n\nGiven a positive integer `n`, return the **smallest possible integer**, such that it is a multiple of all numbers from `1` to `n`, both **inclusive**.\n\nAs the results tend to get **very big**, return your answer **modulus** `1_000_000_007`, i.e., `answer % 1_000_000_007`.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe performance requirements are **relatively high** for this one, so just taking the **lowest common multiple** from `1` to `n`, **won't work**.\n\nOn the random tests:\n\n```python\n- Random Tests: 100 tests\n- Integer Size: 1 to 3_000_000\n```\n```haskell\n- Random Tests: 100 tests\n- Integer Size: 1 to 3_000_000\n```\n```scala\n- Random tests: 150 tests\n- Integer Size: 1 to 3_000_000\n```\n```javascript\n- Random Tests: 100 tests\n- Integer Size: 1 to 9_000_000\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\n  1  ->            1\n  2  ->            2\n  6  ->           60\n 10  ->        2_520\n 20  ->  232_792_560\n 81  ->  853_087_536\n243  ->  309_031_427\n```",
