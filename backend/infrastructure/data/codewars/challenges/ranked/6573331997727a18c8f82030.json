  "description": "You are given a ```string``` of lowercase letters and spaces that you need to type out. You may notice some square brackets inside the string. \n\n- If it contains letters, type out the text inside then copy it.\n- If it is empty, paste the copied text\n- If it contains a number, paste the copied text that number of times.\n\nHere are a few examples.\n\n`[ten ]ten   [3]` -> `ten ten   ten ten ten `\n\n`[one hundred and ]one, []two, []three` -> `one hundred and one, one hundred and two, one hundred and three`\n\n`[100][repeat me][2]` -> `repeat merepeat merepeat me` (pasting nothing 100 times is still nothing)\n\nNotes:\n\n- Although it is possible, nested loops will not be tested.\n- The number inside the bracket will always be a positive integer (1, 2, 3...).\n- All inputs will be valid (no unclosed brackets, etc)\n\n\nMore examples in the smaple tests.\n\nGood luck!\n______\n\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/collections/65abaddba4b9f2013327dd3d\">the rest of the kata in this series</a>!",
