  "description": "## Task\n\nReturn the **exact probability** as a ratio of drawing **at least** `target` marbles of the specified `color` out of `draws` total draws **without replacement** from the specified `urn`.\n\n### Input\n\n- `urn`: an object depicting an urn where each key is a color (string), and each value the number of marbles of that color (integer)\n- `color`: the color we are interested in (string)\n- `draws`: the total number of draws from the urn, without replacement (integer)\n- `target`: the least amount of marbles we want to draw from the urn (integer)\n\n### Output\n\n- return the exact probability as ratio (array with 2 elements; the numerator (big integer) and denominator (big integer))\n\n### Constraints\n\n- the ratio needs to be in compact form: `[2, 4]` should be `[1, 2]`\n- the urn won't be empty\n- the color is always available in the urn\n- the amount of marbles by color is a non-negative integer\n- the total amount of draws is a positive integer, and won't be more than the total number of marbles in the urn\n- the target is a non-negative integer and won't be more than:\n  - the amount of marbles of the specified color\n  - the amount of draws\n\n---\n\n### Kata Series\n\n- <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/66116892fe0da461e0b4b0df\">Drawing marbles from an urn - Part 1</a>\n- Drawing marbles from an urn - Part 2 (this kata)\n- <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/661072818e270c0023c860cb\">Drawing marbles from an urn - Part 3</a>\n\n---\n\nGood luck, have fun!\n\n",
