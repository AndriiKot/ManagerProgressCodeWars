  "description": "Telepathy:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a simple magic trick.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it fascinating after watching this magic trick.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's how the trick goes:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the magician has 6 cards in hand.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the magician asks you to choose a number between 0 and 60 and remember it.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, the magician tells you to say \"Yes\" when you see your chosen number among the cards, otherwise say \"No\".\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the magician, after listening to all your answers, can sense the number you remembered and reveal it.\n\nTask:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; Your task is to play the role of the magician.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; I will give you a string representing the audience's answers.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to guess the number chosen by the audience.\n\n***&nbsp;&nbsp; card has multiple numbers written on it and this set of 6 cards never changes.***\n\n```python\n\"| Card 1: Yes | Card 2: Yes | Card 3: Yes | Card 4: Yes | Card 5: No | Card 6: Yes |\" -> 47\n```\n\n~~~if:python\n    Only 1 line of code and 106 characters of code can be used.\n~~~\n~~~if:kotlin\n    Only 1 line of code and 135 characters of code can be used.\n~~~\n~~~if:javascript\n    Only 1 line of code and 105 characters of code can be used.\n~~~\n~~~if:coffeescript\n    Only 1 line of code and 105 characters of code can be used.\n~~~\n~~~if:typescript\n    Only 1 line of code and 120 characters of code can be used.\n~~~\n~~~if:php\n    Only 1 line of code and 120 characters of code can be used.\n~~~\n~~~if:c\n    Only 1 line of code and 150 characters of code can be used.\n~~~\n~~~if:cpp\n    Only 1 line of code and 111 characters of code can be used.\n~~~\n\n\nWe welcome all codewarriors to leave comments on areas they would like to improve or maintain.\n\n\n--Good luck codewarrior--\n",
