  "description": "#### In this Kata you must calulate the number of bounces a ball makes when shot between two walls\n---\n# Task Details:\n+ Mr Reecey has bought a new ball cannon and he lives in a tower block\n\n+ He wants to calulate the number of bounces between the two towers before he shoots his shot\n\n+ The gun is set up to fire with a velocity v, on the tower block height h and the width between them as w\n\n+ Finally, he angles his gun at an angle theta (measured in radians from the horizontal)\n\n#### In this diagram the ball bounces twice:\n```python\n\n        |\t\t        Velocity\t  |    / \\\n        |\t\t             <---_____|     |\n        |\t\t            *\t______     |\n        |\t\t\t *\t            |\t |\n        | \t         \t    \t\t|\t |\n        |\t    *   \t\t\t      |\t |\n        |\t             \t\t     |\t |\n        |\t\t            \t      |\t |\n        |   *\t\t            \t  |\t |\n        |\t\t\t                  |\t |\n        |*\t\t\t                 |\t |\n        |\t\t\t       \t       |   Height\n        |\t\t *\t\t            |\t |\n        |\t\t   \t\t           |\t |\n        |\t     \t\t        \t |\t |\n        |\t     \t  *       \t   |\t |\n        |\t\t\t\t              |\t |\n        |\t   \t        \t  \t |\t |\n        |\t\t\t\t     *        |\t |\n        |\t\t\t\t              |\t |\n        |\t\t\t\t              |\t |\n        |    \t           \t   *   |\t |\n        |\t\t\t\t              |\t |\n        |   \t\t\t        \t  *|\t |\t                                           \n        <-------- Width -------------->     \\ /\n```\n\n# Technicalities:\n+ There are 5 fixed tests and 100 random tests\n\n+ SI units are used for height, width and velocity (m,m m/s)\n\n+ Mr Reecey uses g = 9.81, ignores air resistance and assumes elastic collisions\n\n+ The ball is modlled as very small\n\n+ Also, remember to return the number of bounces as an integer\n\n\n",
