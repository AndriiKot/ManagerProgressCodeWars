  "description": "# Planting carrots #\n\n```\nOld MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O.\nAnd on that farm he had a cow, E-I-E-I-O.\nWith a moo moo here and a moo moo there\nHere a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo moo\nOld MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O.\n```\n\nThe farmer loves carrots, unfortunately evil rabbits still steal them!\n\nMacDonald decided to surround a fragment of his garden with the fence where he will be able to safely plant his favorite vegetables.\n\nBecause the farmer was a mathematician, he plants carrots only in places with integer coordinates also the fence is made of straight sections hooked at points with integer coordinates.\n\nGiven coordinates of fence, help the farmer count how many carrots he can plant in his garden!\n\n## Example ##\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7Y5Sbj8.png\">\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top\">\nIn this example, fence is build of 5 segments and surrounds area with 23 possible carrots positions.\n\n```\n  count_carrots([[0, 0], [6, 2], [7, -1], [4, -4], [1, -3]]) == 23\n```\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n## Task ##\n\nComplete the function `count_carrots` which receive fence coordinates as only arguments and\nshould return maximum number of carrots thet farmer can plant.\n\n## Notes ##\n\n* Surrounded area is a simple polygon.\n* Fence has at least 3 vertices and at most 1000. Coordinates are bounded by -10<sup>6</sup> <= x,y <= 10<sup>6</sup>.",
