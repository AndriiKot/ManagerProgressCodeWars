  "description": "In the United States, one of the most important days of the year is colloquially known as \"[Black Friday][bf]\".  On this day, millions of pilgrims sojourn to their local centers of capitalism to stand in long lines and trade currency for flat-screen TVs and two-dollar DVDs.\n\n**Black Friday**&mdash;so-called because on this day some retailers' accounting books move from \"the red\" (having net losses) to \"the black\" (having net profits)&mdash;is traditionally celebrated on **the day immediately following** the American [Thanksgiving][tg] holiday, which always falls on the **fourth Thursday in November**.\n\nYou have recently been hired by a large boat retailer, _Beast Bouy_, who wants to know exactly what date they can expect shoppers to crowd their store and purchase their stocks of moderately discounted jet-skis.  Your first task at this job is create a `blackFriday` function which accepts an integer *year*, and returns the *day of the month* of November that Black Friday falls on in that year.  Your function only needs to support years after 1752\\*.\n\n----\n\n<sub>\\* This happens to be the year that the British Empire adopted the [Gregorian calendar][gc].  The Javascript Date object uses an *extrapolated* Gregorian calendar, meaning it is not necessarily accurate to reality for dates in the far past.</sub>\n\n[bf]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)\n[tg]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)\n[ce]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_era\n[gc]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#Adoption_in_Europe",
