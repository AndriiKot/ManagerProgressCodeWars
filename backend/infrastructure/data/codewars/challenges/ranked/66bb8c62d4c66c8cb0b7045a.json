  "description": "Four identical right triangles are inscribed in a square, with their hypotenuses \n\ncoinciding with the sides of the square (see the image). Find the area of the shaded \n\nfigure in the image, given that the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangles is \n\n'hypotenuse', and the length of the cathetus (leg) is 'cathetus'.\n\nThe other leg of the triangle is determined using the Pythagorean theorem,\n\nso it does not matter which leg is longer.\n\nEnsure that both hypotenuse and cathetus are always non-negative numbers.\n\nif hypotenuse and cathetus is equal return 0.\n\n![Description image](https://i.imgur.com/bryEbT8.png)",
