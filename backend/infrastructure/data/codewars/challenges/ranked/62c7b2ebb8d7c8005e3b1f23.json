  "description": "You're most likely familiar with Pascal's Triangle. If you aren't, I recommend trying [the kata found here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52945ce49bb38560fe0001d9) on which this kata is based. The 2-D Pascal's triangle can be generalized to 3-D in the form of Pascal's Pyramid (technically a tetrahedron).\n\nEach layer of the pyramid is a triangle with the following form. Each side of a given layer is one cell longer than the sides of the previous layer. All three corner cells are always 1. All other cells are equal to the sum of the 3 (or 2 for cells on the edge of the new layer) closest cells in the previous layer. For example, below are the first 5 layers of the pyramid.\n\n```\n  1              1                  1                      1                          1        \n               1   1              2   2                  3   3                      4   4      \n      -->               -->     1   2   1    -->       3   6   3      -->         6  12   6    \n                                                     1   3   3   1              4  12  12   4  \n                                                                              1   4   6   4   1\n\n n=1            n=2                n=3                    n=4                        n=5\n```\n\nYour task is to define a function `pascal_pyr_layer` that provides the `n`-th layer of Pascal's Pyramid.\n\n## Closest Cells in the Previous Layer\n\nThis section clarifies what cells in a higher layer are used to find the value of a cell in the next lower layer. As an example, take layers 3 -> 4:\n```\n    1          1   \n   2 2   ->   3 3  \n  1 2 1      3 6 3 \n            1 3 3 1\n```\n\nIf you overlay these on top of eachother and look at them from above, the elements in the higher layer (layer 3 here) will be located just below (from our perspective) the elements with the same position in the lower layer. For instance, the two layers above can be overlain as so (level 3 in italics, level 4 in bold):\n<pre>\n          <b>1</b>\n          <i>1</i>\n       <b>3</b>     <b>3</b>\n       <i>2</i>     <i>2</i>\n    <b>3</b>     <b>6</b>     <b>3</b>\n    <i>1</i>     <i>2</i>     <i>1</i>\n <b>1</b>     <b>3</b>     <b>3</b>     <b>1</b>\n</pre>\nFrom this, we can see that every element in layer 4 is the sum of the (one to three) elements in layer 3 that are immediately in the down, up-right, and up-left directions from a top-down view. These are also the three closest elements in the layer above.\n\n## Input\n\nAn integer `n` in the range `1 <= n <= 100`\n\n## Output\n\nThe `n`-th layer of the pyramid. This should be formatted as a nested array. For example, the 5-th layer of the pyramid\n\n```\n        1        \n      4   4      \n    6  12   6    \n  4  12  12   4  \n1   4   6   4   1\n\n       n=5\n```\n\nshould be returned as `[[1], [4, 4], [6, 12, 6], [4, 12, 12, 4], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]`",
