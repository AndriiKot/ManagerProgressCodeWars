  "description": "### Task\nCreate a function `baseSum` that given an array of string in base `n` and the number `n`, return the result of summing all items of the array when changed to decimal (base-10) and changing it to base `n` again.\n\n### Input\nAn array containing string with array length range: `2 <= array.length <= 50` and string length range `1 <= array[i].length <= 25`,\n\nand `n` (the radix / base) with range: `2 <= n <= 62` (will be explained in the next section)\n\n### Characters\nFor this kata, the max radix will be 62. Here is the ordered list of the characters that will be used in the string (which you can copy paste to your code):\n```\n0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n```\n\n### Examples\n```\narray = [\"300\", \"523\", \"a27\"] n = 30\n-> \"300\" in base 30 would be 2700 in decimal\n-> \"523\" in base 30 would be 4563 in decimal\n-> \"a27\" in base 30 would be 9067 in decimal\n-> Sum them up, you get 16330\n-> 16330 in base 30 would be \"i4a\"\n\narray = [\"AbC\", \"42a\"] n = 56\n-> \"AbC\" (base 56) = 113550 (decimal)\n-> \"42a\" (base 56) = 12666 (decimal)\n-> sum = 126216\n-> The sum in base 56 would be \"EdM\"\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n- The string in the array when being converted to base-10 number can be really big that it exceeds the number size limit, leading to inaccurate result. Find a way to optimize your function.\n- You're not allowed to use BigInt, require, eval, or any other functions that may help you cheat through this challenge.\n- You will have to deal with leading zeros in the numbers.\n- There will be 231 random tests waiting for you.\n- Don't worry, this kata is not focused on performance. Most inefficient solution should still be able to pass this kata. However, it's still important to not use inefficient solution.\n\nGood luck! :)",
