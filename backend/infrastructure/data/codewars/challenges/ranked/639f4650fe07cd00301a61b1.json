  "description": "## Description\nYou are given 2 tuples and a number. First tuple is x1 and y1 coordinates of first point, and the second tuple is x2 and y2 coordinates of second point accordingly. There is can be one and only one line, that goes through that two points, and if there is some third point on this line, you just need to know one of it coordinates, so that you will know another one as well. Your task is to output the y3 coordinate of third point, if you are given it's x3 coordinate ( as the third argument ).\n\nGiven numbers can be positive as well as negative, integers or floats. Your answer shouldn't be rounded!!\n\nNote that x1 will be always different from x2, you don't need to worry about it.\n![explanation on graphic](https://justpaste.it/img/164d13dc539fa1c64157acd709becd2d.png \"Explanation on graphic\")\n\n## Examples\n```python\nfind_the_point((5,3), (10,4), 20) => 6 #from the graphic above\nfind_the_point((1,10), (2,20), 10) => 100 #1 is 10, 2 is 20, than, well, 10 is 100))\nfind_the_point((1,20), (20,20), 30) => 20 #1 is 20, 20 is also 20, than 30 is as well 20. Edge case for y=20.\n```",
