  "description": "Anyone knows his yearly jubilees, but there are other interesting jubilees, which are great to start parties as well.\n\nFor example, everyone (almost) celebrates his or her 20th birthday. That is the date, when we live for 20 years (esay). But who knows the date to celebrate 6666 days of living?\n\nWe want to help and get a list of celebrateable days from a function. Please write the following function: \n\n```javascript\nfunction celebrations(event, calcDay)\n```\n\nThe function shall return an array of jubilee events, starting at `calcDay`. Each element of the array has a date and a description string, ordered by date. We only want to celebrate `'full'` or `'funny'` events. That events will be designated by a number with one digit and only zeroes following*(full)* or all the same digits *(funny)*. E.g.: 10, 20, 400, 555, 77, 800000... We want to celebrate on years or days.\n> If in doubt: for little children below 10 years, each birthday is **both**: `full` & `funny`.\n\nThe kinds of events are: simple years (n000), fuzzy years (nnnn), simple days (n000) and fuzzy days (nnnn). Only the first event of each kind shall be listed.\n\nFor example, event may be 1990-03-04 and we want all jubilees for a full year, starting at 2009-07-01. The result shall be:\n```javascript\n[{date: 2010-03-04, jubilee: \"10 years\"},\n {date: 2011-02-05, jubilee: \"4000 days\"},\n {date: 2011-03-04, jubilee: \"11 years\"},\n {date: 2012-05-04, jubilee: \"4444 days\"}]\n```",
