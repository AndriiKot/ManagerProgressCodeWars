  "description": "# Hangman - Puzzles #7\nHangman is a game where you must guess letters of the alphabet to complete a word given the length. You have decided you want to impress your friends with your hangman skills and create a program given a list of predefined words that can complete any hangman guess first time!\n\n## Task\nYou must implement the Machine class that takes a word list and returns a player class that takes a length of the word you must guess. You must then make guesses returning letters of the alphabet to complete the word within 11 failed guesses, as a response you will receive a string representation of the letters found and the letters remaining unknown. Good luck!\n\n## examples\n```\nword: printable\n\nguess: a\nresponse: _____a___\n\nguess: b\nresponse: _____a___\n\nguess: p\nresponse: p____a___\n```\n\n# info\nThe word list will be passed into the machine constructor and you may manipulate that how you see fit.",
