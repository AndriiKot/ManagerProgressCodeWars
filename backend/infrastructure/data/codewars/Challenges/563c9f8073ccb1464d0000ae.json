  "description": "We define a special score for a word (`ssw`) as follows. We multiply the corresponding ASCII decimal code for each letter of the word by its respective frequency of this letter in the word, collect these addens and sum them up.\n\nFor example, for the word ```investigation```, we have the respective ASCII codes and frequencies for each letter:\n```\nLetter    ASCII decimal code        Letter Frequency (in \"investigation\")\n i             105                            3\n n             110                            2\n t             116                            2\n a              97                            1\n e             101                            1\n g             103                            1\n o             111                            1\n s             115                            1\n v             118                            1\n```\n\nSo the ```ssw``` for this word will be:\n```python\nssw = 105 * 3 + 110 * 2 + 116 * 2 + 97 * 1 + 101 * 1 + 103 * 1 + 111 * 1 + 115 * 1 + 118 * 1 = 1412\n```\n\n\n## Task\n\nComplete the function that receives two arguments, \n  * number of letters, `num_let`\n  * maximum special score `max_ssw` for the word\n\nYou were also provided with a list of 2000 words of the Oxford Dictionary Of English (U.K. English), named `WORD_LIST` for python, `$word_list` for ruby, `wordList` for JavaScript.\n\nThe function should output a word from the database of 2000 words that has the highest possible `ssw` of the given number of letters but smaller or equal to the given `max_ssw`. \n\nIf we have more than one word with the same number of letters, `num_let`, and the same special score, `ssw`, choose the largest word in lexicographical order.\n\nIf there are no words in the database that satisfies the given `num_let` and `max_ssw`, return `None` in Python, `nil` in Ruby, `null` in JavaScript.\n\n\n## Example\n\nLet's see some cases:\n\n```python\nnum_let = 8\nmax_ssw = 888\n# There are three words with 8 letters and with ssw == 888\n#   \"question\", \"security\" and \"southern\"\n# The list of these words sorted with its respective ssw is \n#   [(888, \"question\"), (888, \"security\"), (888, \"southern\")],\n# \"southern\" should be chosen\n\nnum_let = 9\nmax_ssw = 500\n# The word of 9 letters with minimum ssw is \"candidate\" with ssw = 925\n# There are no 9 letter words with less than or equal to 500 ssw\n# Should return None in Python, nil in Ruby, null in JavaScript\n```\n\nWe may have the case when the all the words of certain number of letters are below `max_ssw`.\n\n```python\nnum_let = 7\nmax_ssw = 1412\n# Should return \"support\"\n# \"support\" is the word of 7 letters with highest ssw (797)\n```\n\n---\n\nEnjoy it!\n",
