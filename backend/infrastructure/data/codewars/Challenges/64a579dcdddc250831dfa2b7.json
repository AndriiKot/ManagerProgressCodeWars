  "description": "Imagine a system where users are classified into one of two classes - 'a' or 'b'. A single user may belong to one class, or they may belong to both. Also, a unique aspect of this system is that a user may have multiple records of belonging to the same class, or they may belong to both classes multiple times. \n\nYour task is to write a query that accurately counts the number of users in each class, with a special rule: If a user belongs to both classes, they should only be counted under class 'b'.\n\n `users` table has the following schema:\n\n* `id` (integer): A unique identifier for each record.\n* `user_id` (integer): An identifier for each user. Note that the same user ID may appear multiple times if a user belongs to multiple classes.\n* `class` (char): The class a user belongs to. It can only be either 'a' or 'b'.\n\nYour resulting output will include the following columns:\n\n* `class` (char): The class identifier. In this assignment, it can only be 'a' or 'b'.\n* `count` (integer): The number of unique users belonging to each class, considering the special rule that a user belonging to both 'a' and 'b' should only be counted under class 'b'.\n\nSo thus such dataset:\n\n```\nid | user_id | class |\n---|---------|-------|\n1  | 1       | a     |\n2  | 1       | b     |\n3  | 1       | b     |\n4  | 2       | b     |\n5  | 3       | a     |\n```\nwill provide the following result:\n\n```\n| class | count |\n|-------|-------|\n| a     | 1     |\n| b     | 2     |\n```\n\nGLHF!\n",
