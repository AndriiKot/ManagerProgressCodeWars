  "description": "# Summary\n\nStarted in 2008 and recently resurging in popularity, a game known as [Number Neighbour or Text Door Neighbor](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/number-neighbor-text-door-neighbor) has people sending a text message to phone numbers near their own. Traditionally this was done for numbers ±1, so someone with the phone number 555-555-5555 has neighbors 555-555-555**4** and 555-555-555**6**.\n\nWe're going to take this a step further and think about neighbors based on a classic phone keypad.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the classic phone keypad:\n```\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n  0\n```\n\nWe can consider certain numbers adjacent if they appear directly next to or above/below each other. For example, `1` is adjacent to `2` and `4` (and nothing else), while `5` is adjacent to `2`, `4`, `6`, and `8`.\n\nLet's look for phone numbers that are \"neighbors\" of a given phone number by having any one (and only one) of their digits be off-by-one as a number adjacent to the original.\n\nBy this definition, 555-555-5555 has both its original neighbors but also, e.g., 55**4**-555-5555 and 555-555-555**8**.\n\n# Problem\n\nGiven a phone number of integer length `N` (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10) as a number string (e.g. 555-555-5555 would be passed as `\"5555555555\"`), return an array of all phone numbers as number strings that would be considered neighbors of that phone number.\n\n# Examples\n\n```ruby\nGiven:\n\n  \"1\"\n\nReturn:\n\n  [\"2\", \"4\"]\n```\n\n```ruby\nGiven:\n\n  \"8675309\"\n\nReturn:\n\n  [\"5675309\", \"7675309\", \"9675309\", \"0675309\", \"8375309\", \"8575309\", \"8975309\",\n   \"8645309\", \"8685309\", \"8672309\", \"8674309\", \"8676309\", \"8678309\", \"8675209\",\n   \"8675609\", \"8675389\", \"8675306\", \"8675308\"]\n```\n\n# Notes\n * Do not wrap around a side of the keypad when finding adjacent numbers. That is, do not consider `6` adjacent to `4` nor `0` adjacent to `2`.\n * Do not consider numbers that are diagonal to each other adjacent\n * Do not worry about invalid characters, `nil`, or anything other than a valid number string being passed in\n * Do not worry about the order of number strings in the array being returned",
