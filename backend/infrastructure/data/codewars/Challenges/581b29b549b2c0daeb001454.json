  "description": "All Unix user know the command line `history`. This one comes with a set of useful commands know as the `bang` command. \n\nFor more information about the history command line you can take a look at: \n\n- The man page -> simply type `man history` in your terminal.\n- The online man page [here](https://linux.die.net/man/3/history).\n- And for more information about the `bang` command you can read [this article](http://jaysoo.ca/2009/09/16/unix-history-and-bang-commands/)\n\nFor this 5th kata we will explore the `!?string` command, according to the man page this one refer to the most recent command preceding the current postition in the history list containing string.\n\nIn this kata you should complete a function that take in an string that correspond to `s`, and an `history` with the following format: \n\n```\n  1  cd /pub\n  2  more beer\n  3  lost\n  4  ls \n  5  touch me \n  6  chmod 000 me \n  7  more me\n  8  history\n```\n\nand that should return the most recent command line that contains executed command line `s`, for example with `s`=\"me\" and the above history it should return `more me`. If user ask for a `s` without any know entry for example `n=you` here, the function should return `!you: event not found`.\n\n**Note**: Lot of the command line comes form some geeky t-shirt and form this [excellent page](http://langevin.univ-tln.fr/cours/UPS/extra/unix-shell-jokes.txt).\n\n\n",
