  "description": "[Langton's ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) is a two-dimensional Turing machine invented in the late 1980s. The ant starts out on a grid of black and white cells and follows a simple set of rules that has complex emergent behavior.\n\n\n## Task\n\nComplete the function and return the `n`th iteration of Langton's ant with the given input.\n\n\n### Parameters:\n\n* `grid` - a two dimensional array of `1`s and `0`s (representing white and black cells respectively)\n* `column` - horizontal position of ant\n* `row` - ant's vertical position\n* `n` - number of iterations\n* `dir` - ant's current direction (0 - north, 1 - east, 2 - south, 3 - west), **should default to 0**\n\n**Note:** parameters `column` and `row` will always be inside the `grid`, and number of generations `n` will never be negative.\n\n\n## Output\n\nThe state of the `grid` after `n` iterations.\n\n\n## Rules\n\nThe ant can travel in any of the four cardinal directions at each step it takes. The ant moves according to the rules below:\n\n* At a white square (represented with `1`), turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, and move forward one unit.\n* At a black square (`0`), turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, and move forward one unit.\n\nThe grid has no limits and therefore if the ant moves outside the borders, the grid should be expanded with `0`s, respectively maintaining the rectangle shape.\n\n\n## Example\n\n```python\nant([[1]], 0, 0, 1, 0)   # should return: [[0, 0]]\n```\n```julia\nant([1; 1], 1, 1, 1, 0)   # should return: [0 0; 1 0]\n```\n\n\nInitially facing north (`0`), at the first iteration the ant turns right (because it stands on a white square, `1`), flips the square and moves forward.",
