  "description": "# Task\n In mathematics, a `function` is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output. In other words, for every `x` from the set of inputs there is exactly one element `y` from the set of outputs, such that the ordered pair `(x, y)` is contained in the set defining the function.\n\n You are given a set of pairs that defines something. Your task is to figure out whether this something can be a function or not.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` 2D float array `pairs`\n\n  A non-empty set of pairs. Each pair is given as a two-element array, where the first element belongs to the set of inputs, and the second one belongs to the set of outputs.\n\n - `[output]` a boolean value\n\n  `true` if the given set can define a function and `false` otherwise.\n\n# Example\n\n For `pairs = [[0.5,1.5],[2.5,3.5]]`, the output should be `true`.\n\n For `pairs = [[5,1],[2.5,3.4],[5,6],[7,2]]`, the output should be `false`.\n \n The given set can't possibly define a function, since values `y = 1` and `y = 6` both correspond to the value `x = 5`.",
