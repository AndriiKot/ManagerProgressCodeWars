This statement 'str8ng is he17e' should converted to 'string is here', its just converting these numbers to ASCII code then to a char according to it.\n\nSo you should understand how ASCII code of chars are sorted, and if its begin with 'a' as 0, next one is 'b' which is 1 in someway. \n\neach word contains just one character to convert the number to it.\n\nExample:\nif given string is '0pple' that will return 'apple'.\n\n",
