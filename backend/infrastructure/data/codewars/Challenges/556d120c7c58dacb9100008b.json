  "description": "# Problem Statement\nWrite a function that takes two string parameters, an IP (v4) address and a subnet mask, and returns two strings: the network block, and the host identifier.\n\nThe function does not need to support CIDR notation.\n\n# Description\nA single IP address with subnet mask actually specifies several addresses: a network block, and a host identifier, and a broadcast address. These addresses can be calculated using a bitwise AND operation on each bit.\n\n(The broadcast address is not used in this kata.)\n\n## Example\nA computer on a simple home network might have the following IP and subnet mask:\n```\nIP: 192.168.2.1\nSubnet: 255.255.255.0\n(CIDR Notation: 192.168.2.1 /24)\n```\nIn this example, the network block is: **192.168.2.0**. And the host identifier is: **0.0.0.1**. \n\n## bitwise AND \nTo calculate the network block and host identifier the bits in each octet are ANDed together. When the result of the AND operation is '1', the bit specifies a network address (instead of a host address).\n\nTo compare the first octet in our example above, convert both the numbers to binary and perform an AND operation on each bit:\n```\n11000000 (192 in binary)\n11111111 (255 in binary)\n--------------------------- (AND each bit)\n11000000 (192 in binary)\n```\nSo in the first octet, '**192**' is part of the network address. The host identifier is simply '**0**'.\n\nFor more information see the [Subnetwork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork) article on Wikipedia.\n",
