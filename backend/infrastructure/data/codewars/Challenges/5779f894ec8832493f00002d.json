  "description": "Fibonacci numbers are generated by setting F<sub>0</sub> = 0, F<sub>1</sub> = 1, and then using the formula:\n\n# F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>\n\nYour task is to efficiently calculate the **n**th element in the Fibonacci sequence and then count the occurrence of each digit in the number. Return a list of integer pairs sorted in **descending** order.\n\n10 ≤ n ≤ 100000\n\n## Examples\n```\nf(10) = 55  # returns [(2, 5)], as there are two occurances of digit 5\n\nf(10000)    # returns:\n  [(254, 3),\n   (228, 2),\n   (217, 6),\n   (217, 0),\n   (202, 5),\n   (199, 1),\n   (198, 7),\n   (197, 8),\n   (194, 4),\n   (184, 9)]\n```\nIf two integers have the same count, sort them in descending order.\n\nYour algorithm must be efficient.\n\n~~~if:javascript\nThanks to `kazk` for assisting with the translation.\n~~~",
