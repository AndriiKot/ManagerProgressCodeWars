  "description": "Batman & Robin have gotten into quite a pickle this time. The Joker has mixed up their iconic quotes and also replaced one of the characters in their names, with a digit. They need help getting things back in order.\n\nImplement the function which takes in an array of quotes, and a string comprised of letters and a single digit (e.g. `\"Rob1n\"`) where the number corresponds to their quote indexed in the passed in array.\n\nReturn the quote along with the character who said it:\n\n```\nquotes = [\n  \"I am vengeance. I am the night. I am Batman!\",\n  \"Holy haberdashery, Batman!\",\n  \"Let's put a smile on that faaaceee!\"\n]\nhero = \"Rob1n\"\n\nShould output => \"Robin: Holy haberdashery, Batman!\"\n```\n\nYou are guaranteed that the number in the passed in string is placed somewhere after the first character of the string. The quotes either belong to `\"Batman\"`, `\"Robin\"`, or `\"Joker\"`.",
