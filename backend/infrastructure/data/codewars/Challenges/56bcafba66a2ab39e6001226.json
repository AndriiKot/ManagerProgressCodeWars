  "description": "# Story\n\nJohn found a path to a treasure, and while searching for its precise location he wrote a list of directions using symbols `\"^\"`, `\"v\"`, `\"<\"`, `\">\"` which mean `north`, `south`, `west`, and `east` respectively. On his way John had to try many different paths, sometimes walking in circles, and even missing the treasure completely before finally noticing it.\n\n___\n\n## Task\n\nSimplify the list of directions written by John by eliminating any loops.\n\n**Note**: a loop is any sublist of directions which leads John to the coordinate he had already visited.\n\n___\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n   Path        |  Result   \n---------------------------\n  \"<>>\"        |  \">\"      \n  \"<^^>v<^^^\"  |  \"<^^^^\"  \n  \"\"           |  \"\"       \n  \"^<<v\"       |  \"^<<v\"   \n```\n\n___\n\n## Simplification explanation\n\n1) Let's say John starts at point `A` and goes to point `B`.  \n2) On his way he passes point `C`.  \n3) Later he returns to point `B` (remember that John may be going in circles sometimes).  \n4) The sublist of directions between the first and second visits of point `B` **SHOULD BE REMOVED**, as John doesn't progress by following those.  \n5) He starts walking around again, and passes through point `C`.  \n6) These directions **SHOULD NOT BE REMOVED** because after simplifying his path he arrives at point `C` for the first time! (Remember that John doesn't follow the directions he simplifies, so visiting it for the \"first time\" is a hypothetical path, and visiting it for the \"second time\" is his real path; when hypothetical and real paths intersect, we ignore this fact.)\n\n### Example\n\n```\n    > > v\n    ^   v\n> > C > D > >\n^   ^   v\n^ < B < <\n    ^\n    A\n```\n\nJohn visits points `A -> B -> C -> D -> B -> C -> D`, realizes that `-> C -> D -> B` steps are meaningless and removes them, getting this path: `A -> B -> (*removed*) -> C -> D`.\n\n```\n    ∙ ∙ ∙\n    ∙   ∙\n> > C > D > >\n^   ∙   ∙\n^ < B ∙ ∙\n    ^\n    A\n```\n\nFollowing the final, simplified route John visits points `C` and `D`, but for the first time, not the second (because we ignore the steps made on a hypothetical path), and he doesn't need to alter the directions list anymore.",
