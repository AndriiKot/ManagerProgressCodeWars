  "description": "I'm afraid you're in a rather unfortunate situation. You've injured your leg, and are unable to walk, and a number of zombies are shuffling towards you, intent on eating your brains. Luckily, you're a crack shot, and have your trusty rifle to hand.\n\nThe zombies start at `range` metres, and move at `0.5` metres per second. Each second, you first shoot one zombie, and then the remaining zombies shamble forwards another `0.5` metres.\n\nIf any zombies manage to get to `0` metres, you get eaten. If you run out of ammo before shooting all the zombies, you'll also get eaten. To keep things simple, we can ignore any time spent reloading.\n\nWrite a function that accepts the total number of zombies, a range in metres, and the number of bullets you have.\n\nIf you shoot all the zombies, return `\"You shot all X zombies.\"`\nIf you get eaten before killing all the zombies, and before running out of ammo, return `\"You shot X zombies before being eaten: overwhelmed.\"`\nIf you run out of ammo before shooting all the zombies, return `\"You shot X zombies before being eaten: ran out of ammo.\"`\n\n(If you run out of ammo at the same time as the remaining zombies reach you, return `\"You shot X zombies before being eaten: overwhelmed.\"`.)\n\nGood luck! (I think you're going to need it.)",
