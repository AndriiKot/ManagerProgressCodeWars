  "description": "At a job interview, you are challenged to write an algorithm to check if a given string, `s`, can be formed from two other strings, `part1` and `part2`.\n\nThe restriction is that the characters in `part1` and `part2` should be in the same order as in `s`.\n\nThe interviewer gives you the following example and tells you to figure out the rest from the given test cases.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n'codewars' is a merge from 'cdw' and 'oears':\n\n    s:  c o d e w a r s   = codewars\npart1:  c   d   w         = cdw\npart2:    o   e   a r s   = oears\n```",
