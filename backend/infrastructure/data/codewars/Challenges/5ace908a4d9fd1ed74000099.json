  "description": "Your friend has given you a secret message nested inside a block of text. She provided you the key to her code as a number and now you must decode the message.\n\nThe number, in binary, represents on/off flags for each word of the phrase. The bit order, overlayed on the array of words, will give which words to include in the phrase.\n```\nExample:\nbittyWords('Long live the king', 11)\nConvert to binary: 11 = 0b1011\nApply binary to words list:\n['Long', 'live', 'the', 'king']\n    1       0      1       1\nresult: 'Long the king'\n```\nIf the number does not have enough bits for the words array, left pad the number with 0s.\n\nExample:\n```\nbittyWords('So long and thanks for all the fish', 42) === 'and for the'\n```\n42 is 0b101010 which is only 6 words, but the phrase has 8 words. The left two words are 0s and not included in the output.\n\nTo uncomplicate things, there will be no punctuation in the phrases.",
