  "description": "Some new cashiers started to work at your restaurant. \n\nThey are good at taking orders, but they don't know how to capitalize words, or use a space bar! \n\nAll the orders they create look something like this:\n\n`\"milkshakepizzachickenfriescokeburgerpizzasandwichmilkshakepizza\"`\n\nThe kitchen staff are threatening to quit, because of how difficult it is to read the orders. \n\nTheir preference is to get the orders as a nice clean string with spaces and capitals like so:\n\n`\"Burger Fries Chicken Pizza Pizza Pizza Sandwich Milkshake Milkshake Coke\"`\n\nThe kitchen staff expect the items to be in the same order as they appear in the menu. \n\nThe menu items are fairly simple, there is no overlap in the names of the items:\n```\n1. Burger\n2. Fries\n3. Chicken\n4. Pizza\n5. Sandwich\n6. Onionrings\n7. Milkshake\n8. Coke\n```\n",
