  "description": "This kata is the first part of a series: [Neighbourhood kata collection](https://www.codewars.com/collections/5b2f4db591c746349d0000ce). If this one is too easy you can try out the harder katas. ;)\n\n___\nThe neighbourhood of a cell (in a matrix) are cells that are near to it. There are two popular types:\n- The [Moore neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) are eight cells which surround a given cell\n- The [Von Neumann neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood) are four cells which share a border with the given cell\n\n___\n\n## Task\nGiven a neighbourhood type (`\"moore\"` or `\"von_neumann\"`), a 2D matrix (a list of lists) and a pair of coordinates, return the list of neighbours of the given cell.\n\nNotes:\n- The order of the elements in the output list is not important \n- If the input indexes are outside the matrix, return an empty list\n- If the the matrix is empty, return an empty list\n- Order of the indices: the first index should be applied for the outer/first matrix layer and the last index for the most inner/last layer. `coordinates = (m, n)` should be applied like `mat[m][n]`\n\n___\n\n## Examples\n```\n\\ n   0    1    2    3    4\nm  --------------------------\n0  |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |\n1  |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 |\n2  | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 |\n3  | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 |\n4  | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 |\n   --------------------------\n\nget_neighborhood(\"moore\", mat, (1,1)) == [0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12]\nget_neighborhood(\"moore\", mat, (0,0)) == [1, 6, 5]\nget_neighborhood(\"moore\", mat, (4,2)) == [21, 16, 17, 18, 23]\nget_neighborhood(\"von_neumann\", mat, (1,1)) == [1, 5, 7, 11]\nget_neighborhood(\"von_neumann\", mat, (0,0)) == [1, 5]\nget_neighborhood(\"von_neumann\", mat, (4,2)) == [21, 17, 23]\n```\n___\n\n*Translations are appreciated*\n\n* If you like chess take a look at [Chess Aesthetics](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b574980578c6a6bac0000dc)\n* If you like puzzles take a look at [Rubik's cube](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b3bec086be5d8893000002e)\n",
