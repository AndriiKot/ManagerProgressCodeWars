  "description": "You have been recruited by an unknown organization for your cipher encrypting/decrypting skills.  \nBeing new to the organization they decide to test your skills.  \nYour first test is to write an algorithm that encrypts the given string in the following steps.\n\n1. The first step of the encryption is a standard ROT13 cipher.\nThis is a special case of the caesar cipher where the letter is encrypted with its key that is thirteen letters down the alphabet,  \ni.e. `A => N, B => O, C => P, etc..`\n\n1. Part two of the encryption is to take the ROT13 output and replace each letter with its exact opposite. `A => Z, B => Y, C => X`.  \nThe return value of this should be the encrypted message.\n\n\nDo not worry about capitalization or punctuation. All encrypted messages should be lower case and punctuation free.  \nAs an example, the string `\"welcome to our organization\"` should return `\"qibkyai ty ysv yvgmzenmteyz\"`.\n\nGood luck, and congratulations on the new position.\n",
