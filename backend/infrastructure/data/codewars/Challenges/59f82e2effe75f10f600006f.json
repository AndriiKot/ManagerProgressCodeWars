  "description": "# Problem\nBusinessmen, of course, can make much money. However, sometimes, they would lose money in trading. \n\nFor example, John, a businessman, brought in some goods each cost him `$40` and he decided to sell at the price of `$70`. Then a customer came to buy one, gave John `$100`, and of course got back `$30`. \n\nYou may said, \"John earned `$30`.\" But unfortunately, John found the `$100` from the customer was fake. What a poor man! \n\nIn this case John lost his money :(\n\nNow your task is to calculate how much John would lose in this kind of trade. Of course, sometimes John may still earn.\n\n# Task\n\nYou are given four arguments:\n\n- `costPrice`: the cost price of John's good.\n\n- `sellPrice`: the sell price of John's good.\n\n- `fakeMoney`: the total fake money the customer gave John.\n\n- `paidBack`: how much John paid back to the customer.\n\nYour result should be a string: If John loses money after the deal, return `\"Lost $xxx\"`(xxx is the amount of money). Otherwise, return `\"Earned $xxx\"`. \n\nStill not understand the task? Look at the following example ;-)\n\n# Example\n\nFor `costPrice = 40, sellPrice = 70, fakeMoney = 100, paidBack = 30`\n\nthe output should be `\"Lost $70\"`\n\nIn this case John lost `$70`: (`$40` (the goods price) + `$30` (the money paid back to the customer)). \n\nFor `costPrice = 40, sellPrice = 70, fakeMoney = 50, paidBack = 20`\n\nthe output should be `\"Lost $20\"`\n\nIn this case John lost `$20`: John received $40 true money and `$50` fake money, then paid back `$20` true money to the customer. He has `$20` true money left, but the cost price of good is `$40`, so he lost `$20`.\n\n\n# Note\n\n- `0 < costPrice < sellPrice < 100000`\n\n- `0 <= fakeMoney < 100000`\n\n- `0 <= paidBack < 100000`\n\n- Happy Coding `^_^`\n",
