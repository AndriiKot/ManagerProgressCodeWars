  "description": "Upside-Down Pyramid Addition is the process of taking a list of numbers and consecutively adding them together until you reach one number.\n\nWhen given the numbers `2, 1, 1` the following process occurs:\n```\n 2   1   1\n   3   2 \n     5\n```\n\nThis ends in the number `5`.\n\n___\n\n### YOUR TASK\n\nGiven the right side of an Upside-Down Pyramid (Ascending), write a function that will return the original list.\n\n### EXAMPLE\n\n```javascript\n[5, 2, 1] --> [2, 1, 1]\n```\n\nNOTE: The Upside-Down Pyramid will never be empty and will always consist of positive integers ONLY.",
