  "description": "Implement the method `find` which takes in an two parameters `object` and `path`. The `path` will be a period-delimited string of properties that we will use to traverse through our `object` to find our target value.\n\nCheck out this Codecast to get started!  https://codecast.qualified.io/interaction/594197b92f524d001c1ab790\n\n### Edge Cases And Further Consideration\n\n- Be sure to handle passing array indices.\n    For example, if we have an object: `{ people: ['John', 'Dave', 'Lisa'] }` and the path is `'people.1'`, the target value is `'Dave'` which is the string at position 1 inside of the people array.\n\n- Also this method should handle invalid paths. \n    If we have an object `{ user: { name: 'Dan' } }` and the path is `'user.wallet.money'`, we should return `undefined`. Valid paths are exclusive to properties on the object which **are not inherited**, in other words it is specific to this object and does not need to look up the prototype chain. ",
