  "description": "In 1978 the British Medical Journal reported on an outbreak of influenza at a British boarding school. There were `1000` students. The outbreak began with one infected student.\n\nWe want to study the spread of the disease through the population of this school. The total population may be divided into three: \nthe infected `(i)`, those who have recovered `(r)`, and\nthose who are still susceptible `(s)` to get the disease.\n\nWe will study the disease on a period of `tm` days. One model of propagation uses 3 differential equations:\n\n```\n(1) s'(t) = -b * s(t) * i(t)\n(2) i'(t) =  b * s(t) * i(t) - a * i(t)\n(3) r'(t) =  a * i(t)\n```\nwhere `s(t), i(t), r(t)` are the susceptible, infected, recovered at time `t` and \n`s'(t), i'(t), r'(t)` the corresponding derivatives. \n`b` and `a` are constants:\n`b` is representing a number of contacts which can spread the disease and\n`a` is a fraction of the infected that will recover. \n\nWe can transform equations `(1), (2), (3)` in finite differences\n    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method#Example:_ordinary_differential_equation)\n    (http://www.codewars.com/kata/56347fcfd086de8f11000014)\n\n```\n(I)    S[k+1] = S[k] - dt * b * S[k] * I[k]\n(II)   I[k+1] = I[k] + dt * (b * S[k] * I[k] - a * I[k])\n(III)  R[k+1] = R[k] + dt * I[k] *a\n```\nThe interval `[0, tm]` will be divided in `n` small intervals of length `dt = tm/n`.\nInitial conditions here could be : `S0 = 999, I0 = 1, R0 = 0`\nWhatever S0 and I0, R0 (number of recovered at time 0) is always 0.\n\nThe function `epidemic` will return the maximum number of infected\nas an *integer* (truncate to integer the result of max(I)).\n\n#### Example:\n\n```\ntm = 14 ;n = 336 ;s0 = 996 ;i0 = 2 ;b = 0.00206 ;a = 0.41\nepidemic(tm, n, s0, i0, b, a) --> 483\n```\n    \n#### Notes: \n\n- Keeping track of the values of susceptible, infected and recovered you can plot the solutions of the 3 differential equations. See an example below on the plot.\n\n![alternative text](http://i.imgur.com/xB6VSqzm.png)\n",
