  "description": "RNA Nucleotides are represented by four letters: \"A\", \"G\", \"C\" and \"U\". Any other letters are considered invalid for Nucleotides of an RNA sequence.\n\nCreate a function to check the given sequence of letters to ensure there are no invalid Nucleotides.\n\nReturn the message \"Valid Sequence: (letters sequence)\" if that is true. \n\nReturn the message \"There is an invalid letter: (letter). At position: (position in sequence)\" for the first occurance of an invalid letter.\n\nFor example:\n\nGiven the sequence \"AUAUA, the result should return \"Valid Sequence: AUAUA\".\n\nGiven the sequence \"GAUAB\", the result should return \"There is an invalid letter: B. At position: 5\".\n\n<ul> <li>The reported position of the first invalid letter should be using real world counting, counting from 1 not 0, e.g. from sequence AADF, D = position 3.\n\n\n<li>All inputs will be in uppercase and only letters A-Z.\n</ul>\n\nGood luck!",
