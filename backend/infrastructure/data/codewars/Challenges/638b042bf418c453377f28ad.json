  "description": "The code consists of four unique digits (from `0` to `9`).  \nTests will call your solution; you should answer with an array of four digits.  \nYour input is number of matches (the same digit in the same place) with your previous answer. For the first call input value is `-1` (i.e. each new test starts with input `-1`)  \nYou have to find the code in `16` calls or less. You are the best. Do it.\n\n## For example\n\n```if:javascript,php,haskell,python,lua\nThe code is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`  \n1st call `return [1, 3, 4, 5]` will give `1` match in next input  \n2nd call `return [1, 2, 3, 0]` will give `3` matches in next input  \n3rd call `return [1, 2, 3, 4]` will not give `4` matches in next input, because you're the champion!\n```\n\n```if:csharp,java,vb,\nThe code is `{1, 2, 3, 4}`  \n1st call `return new [] {1, 3, 4, 5}` will give `1` match in next input  \n2nd call `return new [] {1, 2, 3, 0}` will give `3` matches in next input  \n3rd call `return new [] {1, 2, 3, 4}` will not give `4` matches in next input, because you're the champion!\n```\n\n## P.S.\n\nIf the task seems too difficult, try [this game](https://www.goobix.com/games/guess-the-number/) with almost the same rules first.",
