  "description": "Odd bits are getting ready for \n[Bits Battles](https://www.codewars.com/kata/world-bits-war/).\n\nTherefore the `n` bits march from right to left along an `8` bits path. Once the most-significant bit reaches the left their march is done. Each step will be saved as an array of `8` integers.\n\nReturn an array of all the steps.\n\n`1 <= n <= 8`\n\nNOTE:\n`n != 0`, because `n` represents the number of `1`s.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nThis resembles a simple 8 LED chaser:\n\n```\nn = 3\n\n00000111\n00001110\n00011100\n00111000\n01110000\n11100000\n```\n\n```\nn = 7\n\n01111111\n11111110\n```\n",
