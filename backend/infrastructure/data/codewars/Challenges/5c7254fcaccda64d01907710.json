  "description": "## Description\n\nYou've been working with a lot of different file types recently as your interests have broadened.\n\nBut what file types are you using the most? With this question in mind we look at the following problem.\n\nGiven a `List/Array` of Filenames (strings) `files` return a `List/Array of string(s)` containing the most common extension(s). If there is a tie, return a sorted list of all extensions.\n\n### Important Info:\n\n* Don't forget, you've been working with a lot of different file types, so expect some interesting extensions/file names/lengths in the random tests.\n* Filenames and extensions will only contain letters (case sensitive), and numbers.\n* If a file has multiple extensions (ie: `mysong.mp3.als`) only count the last extension (`.als` in this case)\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nfiles = ['Lakey - Better days.mp3', \n         'Wheathan - Superlove.wav', \n         'groovy jam.als', \n         '#4 final mixdown.als', \n         'album cover.ps', \n         'good nights.mp3']\n```\n\nwould return: `['.als', '.mp3']`, as both of the extensions appear two times in files.\n\n```\nfiles = ['Lakey - Better days.mp3', \n         'Fisher - Stop it.mp3', \n         'Fisher - Losing it.mp3', \n         '#4 final mixdown.als', \n         'album cover.ps', \n         'good nights.mp3']\n```\nwould return `['.mp3']`, because it appears more times then any other extension, and no other extension has an equal amount of appearences.",
