  "description": "In this Kata, you will be given two strings `a` and `b` and your task will be to return the characters that are not common in the two strings. \n\nFor example:\n```Haskell\nsolve(\"xyab\",\"xzca\") = \"ybzc\" \n--The first string has 'yb' which is not in the second string. \n--The second string has 'zc' which is not in the first string. \n```\nNotice also that you return the characters from the first string concatenated with those from the second string.\n\nMore examples in the tests cases. \n\nGood luck!\n\nPlease also try [Simple remove duplicates](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5ba38ba180824a86850000f7)",
