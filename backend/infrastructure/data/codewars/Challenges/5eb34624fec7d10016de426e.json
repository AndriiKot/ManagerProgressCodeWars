  "description": "You're in the casino, playing Roulette, going for the \"1-18\" bets only and desperate to beat the house and so you want to test how effective the [Martingale strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system)) is. \n\nYou will be given a starting cash balance and an array of binary digits to represent a win (`1`) or a loss (`0`). Return your balance after playing all rounds.\n\n\n*The Martingale strategy*\n\nYou start with a stake of `100` dollars. If you lose a round, you lose the stake placed on that round and you double the stake for your next bet. When you win, you win 100% of the stake and revert back to staking 100 dollars on your next bet.\n\n\n## Example\n```\nStarting cash balance: 1000\nArray of outcomes: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nShould return 1300\n```\n\nExplanation:\n* you win your 1st round: gain $100, balance = 1100\n* you win the 2nd round: gain $100, balance = 1200\n* you lose the 3rd round: lose $100 dollars, balance = 1100\n* double stake for 4th round and lose: staked $200, lose $200, balance = 900\n* double stake for 5th round and win: staked $400, won $400, balance = 1300\n\n**Note: Your balance is allowed to go below 0.**",
