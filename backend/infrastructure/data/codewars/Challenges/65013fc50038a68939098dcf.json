  "description": "Ava, Mark, Sheila, and Pete are at a party. However, Ava and Sheila are only staying if there are at least 4 people, Pete is only staying if there's at least 1 person, and Mark is only staying if there are at least 5 people. Therefore, Mark leaves, which makes Ava and Sheila leave, and Pete is left alone.\n\nGiven an array with the preferences of every person at a party for the minimum number of people present, determine how many people will stay.\n\n### Examples\n\n```\n[4, 5, 4, 1] ➞ 1\n# Ava's minimum number is 4, Mark's is 5, Sheila's is 4, and Pete's is 1.\n# Only 1 person (Pete) stays.\n\n[10, 12, 15, 15, 5] ➞ 0\n\n[2, 1, 2, 0] ➞ 4\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n- All attendees are included in the array.\n- Any person's count includes themself.\n- Expect valid input only.\n- 0 <= len(lst) <= 10^5\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n### Encodings\n\npurity: `LetRec`  \nnumEncoding: `BinaryScott`  \nexport constructors `nil, cons` for your `List` encoding  \n~~~",
