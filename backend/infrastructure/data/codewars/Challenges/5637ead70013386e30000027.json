  "description": "<h1>Multiplication - Generators #2</h1>\nGenerators can be used to wonderful things. You can use them for numerous things, but here is one specific example. You are studying for a test so you must practice your multiplication, but you don't have a multiplication table showing the different examples. You have decided to create a generator that prints out a limitless list of time tables.\n\n<h2>Task</h2>\n<p>\nYour generator must take one parameter `a` then everytime the generator is called you must return a string in the format of: `'a x b = c'` where c is the answer. Also, the value of `b`, which starts at 1, must increment by 1 each time!\n</p>\n\n<strong>More Info: </strong>[Generators (JS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators), <a href=\"https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators\">Generators (Python)</a>, [Generators (PHP)](http://php.net/manual/en/language.generators.php), [Generators (Java)](https://thecannycoder.wordpress.com/2014/07/04/generators/)",
