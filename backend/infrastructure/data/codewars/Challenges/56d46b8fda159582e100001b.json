  "description": "You have recently discovered that horses travel in a unique pattern - they're either running (at top speed) or resting (standing still).\n\nHere's an example of how one particular horse might travel:\n\n\n* The horse Blaze can run at `14` metres/second for `60` seconds, but must then rest for `45` seconds.\n* After `500` seconds Blaze will have traveled `4200` metres.\n\n\nYour job is to write a function that returns how far a horse will have traveled after a given time.\n\n## Input: \n\n* `totalTime` - How long the horse will be traveling (in seconds)\n\n* `runTime` - How long the horse can run for before having to rest (in seconds)\n\n* `restTime` - How long the horse have to rest for after running (in seconds)\n\n* `speed` - The max speed of the horse (in metres/second)\n",
