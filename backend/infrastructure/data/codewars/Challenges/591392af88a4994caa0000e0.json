  "description": "We have a set of consecutive numbers from ```1``` to ```n```.\nWe want to count all the subsets that do not contain consecutive numbers.\nE.g.\n\nIf our set ```S1``` is equal to ```[1,2,3,4,5]```\nThe subsets that fulfill these property are:\n```\n[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,4],[2,5],[3,5],[1,3,5]\n```\nA total of \t```12\t``` subsets.\n\nFrom the set ```S2``` equals to```[1,2,3]```, it is obvious that we have only ```4``` subsets and are:\n```\n[1],[2],[3],[1,3]\n```\nMake a code that may give the amount of all these subsets for any integer \t```n >= 2\t```.\n\nFeatures of the random tests:\n```\nnumber of tests = 100 \n10 <= n <= 120\n```",
