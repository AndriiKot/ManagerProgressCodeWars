  "description": "[Run-length encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) (RLE) is a very simple form of lossless data compression in which runs of data are stored as a single data value and count.\n\nA simple form of RLE would encode the string `\"AAABBBCCCD\"` as `\"3A3B3C1D\"` meaning, first there are `3 A`, then `3 B`, then `3 C` and last there is `1 D`.\n\nYour task is to write a RLE encoder and decoder using this technique. The texts to encode will always consist of only uppercase characters, no numbers.",
