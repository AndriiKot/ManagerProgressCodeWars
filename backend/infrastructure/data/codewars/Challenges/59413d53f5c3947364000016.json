  "description": "You are given a table `random\\_string` that has the following format:\n\n### random\\_string schema\n* text\n\nThe text field holds a single row which contains a random string.\n\nYour task is to take the random string and split it on each vowel (a, e, i, o, u) then the resultant substrings will be contained in the output table, formatted as:\n\n### output table schema\n* results\n\nNote that the vowels should be removed.\n\nIf there are no vowels, there will only be one row returned. Where there are multiple vowels in succession, you will see empty rows. A row should be created on each break, whether there is content in the row or not.\n\nRegex is advised but not mandatory.",
