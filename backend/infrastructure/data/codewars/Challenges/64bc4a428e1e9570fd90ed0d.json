  "description": "# Prelude\nThe painting fence problem involves finding the number of ways to paint a fence with `n` posts and `k` colors, assuming that no more than two adjacent posts have the same color.\n\n# Task\nYour task is to implement a function named ways(n, k) that takes two BigInts as input:\n+ `n` The number of posts in the fence.\n+ `k` The number of colors available for painting the fence.\n\nAnd returns the number of ways of painting the fence such that no more than two adjacent posts have the same color.\nA linear time solution is much too slow for this problem; the numbers will be up to 10 billion!\n\n# Examples\n```javascript\nways(1n, 4n) -> 4n\nways(3n, 2n) -> 6n\nways(4n, 5n) -> 580n\n```\n\n# Constraints\n`n` and `k` will not be greater than 10,000,000,000 or less than 1.<br>\n# Note, result will get very large, return it mod 1000000007",
