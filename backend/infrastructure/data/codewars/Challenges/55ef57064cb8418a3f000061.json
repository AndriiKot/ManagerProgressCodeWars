  "description": "An array of different positive integers is given. We should create a code that gives us the number (or the numbers) that has (or have) the highest number of divisors among other data.\n\nThe function ```proc_arrInt()```, (Javascript: ```procArrInt()```) will receive an array of unsorted integers and should output a list with the following results:\n```python\n[(1), (2), (3)]\n\n(1) - Total amount of numbers received\n(2) - Total prime numbers received\n(3) - a list [(a), (b)]\n      (a)- The highest amount of divisors that a certain number (or numbers) of the given  \n           array have\n      (b)- A sorted list with the numbers that have the largest amount of divisors. The list may  \n           have only one number\n  ```  \n\n## Examples\n ```python\narr1 = [66, 36, 49, 40, 73, 12, 77, 78, 76, 8, 50,\n        20, 85, 22, 24, 68, 26, 59, 92, 93, 30]\n\nproc_arrInt(arr1) ------> [21, 2, [9, [36]]\n\n# 21 integers in the array\n# 2 primes: 73 and 97\n# 36 is the number that has the highest amount of divisors:\n# 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36 (9 divisors, including 1 and 36)\n```\n\nAnother case:\n```python\narr2 = [267, 273, 271, 145, 275, 150, 487, 169, 428, 50, 314, 444, 445,\n        67, 458, 211, 58, 95, 357, 486, 359, 491, 108, 493, 247, 379]\n\nproc_arrInt(arr2) ------> [26, 7, [12, [108, 150, 444, 486]]]\n\n# 26 integers in the array\n# 7 primes: 271, 487, 67, 211, 359, 491, 379\n# 108, 150, 444 and 486 have the highest amount of divisors:\n# 108: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, 108] (12 divisors)\n# 150: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150] (12 divisors)\n# 444: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 37, 74, 111, 148, 222, 444] (12 divisors)\n# 486: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54, 81, 162, 243, 486] (12 divisors)\n```\nHappy coding!!\n\n",
