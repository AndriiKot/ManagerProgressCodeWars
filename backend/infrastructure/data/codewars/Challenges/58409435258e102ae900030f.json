  "description": "In telecomunications we use information coding to detect and prevent errors while sending data. \n\nA parity bit is a bit added to a string of binary code that indicates whether the number of 1-bits in the string is even or odd. Parity bits are used as the simplest form of error detecting code, and can detect a 1 bit error.\n\nIn this case we are using even parity: the parity bit is set to `0` if the number of `1`-bits is even, and is set to `1` if odd.  \n\nWe are using them for the transfer of ASCII characters in binary (7-bit strings): the parity is added to the end of the 7-bit string, forming the 8th bit.\n\nIn this Kata you are to test for 1-bit errors and return a new string consisting of all of the correct ASCII caracters **in 7 bit format** (removing the parity bit), or `\"error\"` in place of ASCII characters in which errors were detected.\n\nFor more information on parity bits: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit\n\n\n## Examples\n\nCorrect 7 bit string with an even parity bit as the 8th bit:\n```\n\"01011001\" <-- The \"1\" on the right is the parity bit.\n```\n\nIn this example, there are three 1-bits. Three is an odd number, and the parity bit is set to `1`. No errors are detected, so return `\"0101100\"` (7 bits).\n\nExample of a string of ASCII characters:\n```\n\"01011001 01101110 01100000 01010110 10001111 01100011\"\n```\nThis should return:\n```\n\"0101100 error 0110000 0101011 error 0110001\"\n```",
