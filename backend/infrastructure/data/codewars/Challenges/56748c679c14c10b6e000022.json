  "description": "If you were born in the 80's you were probably a pre-teen when the Secret World of Alex Mack first aired. I'll be honest, the young superhero was my first crush. Typical superhero story: get slimed by radioactive gunk, obtain super powers, struggle to learn more about your powers while uncovering the truth about yourself, and most importantly, keep your identity a secret.\n\nTop executives at Paradise Valley Chemical Plant are close to finding the superhero's true identity. They know that someone who works at the plant is related to her (Shhh, it's her dad!). Danielle Atron has hired you to obtain the badge number of this person.\n\nCan you find the Secret badge number of Alex Mack's dad?\n\nNote: This is a puzzle. The initial solution is intentionally vague. Good luck!\n\n<div style=\"width: 320px; text-align: center; color: white; border: white 1px solid;\">\nCheck out my other 80's Kids Katas:\n</div>\n<div>\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-1-how-many-licks-does-it-take'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #1:</span> How Many Licks Does It Take</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-2-help-alf-find-his-spaceship'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #2:</span> Help Alf Find His Spaceship</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-3-punky-brewsters-socks'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #3:</span> Punky Brewster's Socks</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-4-legends-of-the-hidden-temple'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #4:</span> Legends of the Hidden Temple</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-5-you-cant-do-that-on-television'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #5:</span> You Can't Do That on Television</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-6-rock-em-sock-em-robots'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #6:</span> Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em Robots</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-7-shes-a-small-wonder'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #7:</span> She's a Small Wonder</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-8-the-secret-world-of-alex-mack'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #8:</span> The Secret World of Alex Mack</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-9-down-in-fraggle-rock'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #9:</span> Down in Fraggle Rock </a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-10-captain-planet'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #10:</span> Captain Planet </a><br />\n\n\n</div>\n",
