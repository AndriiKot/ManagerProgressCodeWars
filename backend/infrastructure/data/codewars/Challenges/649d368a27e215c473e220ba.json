  "description": "Let's consider a situation where we have three tables:\n\n<b>users</b> table:\n\n* Columns: `id`, `name`\n* Primary key: `id`\n\n<b>products</b> table:\n\n* Columns: `id`, `product_name`\n* Primary key: `id`\n\n<b>orders</b> table:\n\n* Columns: `id`, `user_id`, `product_id`\n* Primary key: `id`\n* Foreign keys: `user_id` references users(id), `product_id` references products(id)\n\nIn this kata, we need to find the most popular product (i.e., the product that has been ordered the most). In case of a tie in the number of orders, return all most ordered products ordered by product ID in descending order. Include in the result also the total number of orders for that product.\n\n\nGLHF! \n\n### Desired Output\n\nThe desired output should look like this:\n\n<table><!----><tr><th>product_id</th><th>product_name</th><th>count_orders</th></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Product2</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Product1</td><td>20</td></tr></table>",
