  "description": "Two students are giving each other test answers during a test. They don't want to be caught so they are sending each other coded messages.\n\nFor example one student is sending the following message: `\"Answer to Number 5 Part b\"`. He starts with a square grid (in this example a 5x5 grid) and he writes the message down, including with spaces:\n```\nAnswe\nr to \nNumbe\nr 5 P\nart b\n```\n\nHe then starts writing the message down one column at a time, from the top to the bottom. The encoded message is now: `\"ArNran u rstm5twob  e ePb\"`\n\nYou are the teacher of this class. Your job is to decipher the messages and bust the students.\n\n\n## Task\n\nComplete the function that takes one parameter (the encoded message) and return the original message.\n\n**Note:** The length of the string is always going to be a perfect square.\n\nHave fun !!!\n",
