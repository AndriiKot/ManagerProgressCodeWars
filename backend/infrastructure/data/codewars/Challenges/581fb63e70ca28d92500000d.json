  "description": "Your manager has given you a task to create a report to measure the impact of the next company-wide salary increase. The rules for the salary increase are encapsulated in the function `pctIncrease`, which takes a `department_id` as a parameter and returns the percent increase as a value between 0 and 1.\n\nYou've managed to create a query that would produce the desired results, but it is currently very slow and doesn't finish in the required time window.\n\nYour objective in this kata is to optimize this query. The success criteria is to manage to run the query within the allowed kata solution time window (12 seconds for SQL katas).\n\nThe provided initial solution produces the correct result, but it does not run within the allowed time window.\n\nData model\n==========\n\n```\nTable: Employees\n----------------\nemployee_id   INT / PK\nfirst_name    TEXT\nlast_name     TEXT\nsalary        DECIMAL\ndepartment_id INT / FK\n\nTable: Departments\n------------------\ndepartment_id   INT / PK\ndepartment_name TEXT\n\n```\n\npctIncrease function signature:\n===============================\n\n`pctIncrease(dept_id INT) RETURNS decimal`",
