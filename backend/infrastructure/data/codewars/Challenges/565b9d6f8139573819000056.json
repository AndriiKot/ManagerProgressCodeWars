  "description": "You have managed to intercept an important message and you are trying to read it.\n\nYou realise that the message has been encoded and can be decoded by switching each letter with a corresponding letter.\n\nYou also notice that each letter is paired with the letter that it coincides with when the alphabet is reversed.\n\nFor example: \"a\" is encoded with \"z\", \"b\" with \"y\", \"c\" with \"x\", etc\n\nYou read the first sentence:\n```\n\"r slkv mlylwb wvxlwvh gsrh nvhhztv\"\n```\n\nAfter a few minutes you manage to decode it:\n```\n\"i hope nobody decodes this message\"\n```\nCreate a function that will instantly decode any of these messages\n\nYou can assume no punctuation or capitals, only lower case letters, but remember spaces!",
