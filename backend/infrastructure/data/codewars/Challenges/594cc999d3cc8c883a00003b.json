  "description": "# Task\n\nThere are `n` bears in the orchard and they picked a lot of apples. \n\nThey distribute apples like this:\n\n```\nThe first bear divided the apple into n piles, each with the same number. leaving an apple at last, and the apple was thrown away. Then he took 1 pile and left the n-1 pile.\n\nThe second bear divided the apple into n piles, each with the same number. leaving an apple at last, and the apple was thrown away. Then he took 1 pile and left the n-1 pile.\n\nand so on..\n```\n\nHmm.. your task is coming, please calculate the minimum possible number of these apples (before they start distributing)\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n`[input]` integer `n`\n\nThe number of bears.\n\n`2 <= n <= 9` (JS, Crystal and C)\n`2 <= n <= 50` (Ruby and Python)\n\n`[output]` an integer\n\nThe minimum possible number of apples.\n\n# Example\n\nFor `n = 5`, the output should be `3121`.\n\n```\n5 bears distribute apples:\n\n1st bear divided the apples into 5 piles, each pile has 624 apples, and 1 apple was thrown away.\n3121 - 1 = 624 x 5\n1st bear took 1 pile of apples, 2496 apples left.\n3121 - 1 - 624 = 2496\n\n2nd bear divided the apples into 5 piles, each pile has 499 apples, and 1 apple was thrown away.\n2496 - 1 = 499 x 5\n2nd bear took 1 pile of apples, 1996 apples left.\n2496 - 1 - 499 = 1996\n\n3rd bear divided the apples into 5 piles, each pile has 399 apples, and 1 apple was thrown away.\n1996 - 1 = 399 x 5\n3rd bear took 1 pile of apples, 1596 apples left.\n1996 - 1 - 399 = 1596\n\n4th bear divided the apples into 5 piles, each pile has 319 apples, and 1 apple was thrown away.\n1596 - 1 = 319 x 5\n4th bear took 1 pile of apples, 1276 apples left.\n1596 - 1 - 319 = 1276\n\n5th bear divided the apples into 5 piles, each pile has 255 apples, and 1 apple was thrown away.\n1276 - 1 = 255 x 5\n5th bear took 1 pile of apples, 1020 apples left.\n1276 - 1 - 255 = 1020\n```\n",
