  "description": "A palindrome is a series of characters that read the same forwards as backwards, such as \"hannah\", \"racecar\" and \"lol\".\n\nFor this Kata, you need to write a function that takes a string of characters and returns the length, as an integer value, of the **longest alphanumeric palindrome** that can be formed by combining the characters in any order. You are free to use the characters as many times as it appears in that string. The function should not be case-sensitive.\n\nFor example:\n- Given `\"Hannah\"`, the function should return `6`.\n- Given `\"xyz__a_/b0110//a_zyx\"`, the function should return `13`, one possible alphanumeric palindrome is `\"xyza01b10azyx\"`.",
