  "description": "# Task\n\nHere are some children, each with a certain number of apples. Now we have to do something to make the number of apples of each child are equal.\n\nWe need to complete the redistribution step by step. With each step, we can transfer `two apples` from one child to another (whether or not adjacent does not matter).\n\n```if:javascript\nGiven an array `apples` that represents the number of apples per child. Your task is to calculate the minimum step of the transition operation. If it's impossible, return `-1`.\n```\n```if:haskell\nGiven an array `apples` that represents the number of apples per child. Your task is to calculate the minimum step of the transition operation. If it's impossible, return `Nothing`.\n```\n\n# Example\n\n```if:javascript\nFor `apples=[7,15,9,5]`, the output should be `3`.\n```\n```if:haskell\nFor `apples=[7,15,9,5]`, the output should be `Just 3`.\n```\n```\n                       7 15 9 5\nstep 1: 15-2, 5+2 ---> 7 13 9 7\nstep 2: 13-2, 7+2 ---> 9 11 9 7\nstep 3: 11-2, 7+2 ---> 9  9 9 9\n```\n\n```if:javascript\nFor `apples=[7,7,7,7]`, the output should be `0`.\n```\n```if:haskell\nFor `apples=[7,7,7,7]`, the output should be `Just 0`.\n```\nThe children's apples are equal already.
