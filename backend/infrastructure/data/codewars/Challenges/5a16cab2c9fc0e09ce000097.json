  "description": "In this Kata, you will be given an array and your task will be to determine if an array is in ascending or descending order and if it is rotated or not. \n\nConsider the array `[1,2,3,4,5,7,12]`. This array is sorted in `Ascending` order. If we rotate this array once to the left, we get `[12,1,2,3,4,5,7]` and twice-rotated we get `[7,12,1,2,3,4,5]`. These two rotated arrays are in `Rotated Ascending` order.\n\nSimilarly, the array `[9,6,5,3,1]` is in `Descending` order, but we can rotate it to get an array in `Rotated Descending` order: `[1,9,6,5,3]` or `[3,1,9,6,5]` etc.\n\nArrays will never be unsorted, except for those that are rotated as shown above. Arrays will always have an answer, as shown in the examples below.\n\nMore examples:\n```Haskell\nsolve([1,2,3,4,5,7]) = \"A\" -- Ascending\nsolve([7,1,2,3,4,5]) = \"RA\" -- Rotated ascending\nsolve([4,5,6,1,2,3]) = \"RA\" -- Rotated ascending\nsolve([9,8,7,6]) = \"D\" -- Descending\nsolve([5,9,8,7,6]) = \"RD\" -- Rotated Descending\n```\nMore examples in the test cases. \n\nGood luck!",
