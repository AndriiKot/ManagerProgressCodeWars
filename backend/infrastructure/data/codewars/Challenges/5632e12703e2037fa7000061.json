  "description": "Our standard numbering system is base-10, that uses digits `0` through `9`. Binary is base-2, using only `1`s and `0`s. And hexadecimal is base-16, using digits `0` to `9` and `A` to `F`. A hexadecimal `F` has a base-10 value of `15`.\n\nBase-64 has 64 individual characters (\"digits\") which translate to the base-10 values of `0` to `63`. These are (in ascending order):\n```\nABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/\n```\n(so `A` is equal to `0` and `/` is equal to `63`)\n\n<!--Just as in standard (Base 10) when you get to the highest individual integer 9 the next number adds an additional place and starts at the beginning 10; so also (Base 64) when you get to the 63rd digit '/' and the next number adds an additional place and starts at the beginning \"BA\".-->\n\n\n## Task\n\nComplete the method that will take a base-64 number (as a string) and output its base-10 value as an integer.\n\n\n\n## Examples\n```python\n\"/\"   -->  63\n\"BA\"  -->  64\n\"BB\"  -->  65\n\"BC\"  -->  66\n\"WIN\" -->  90637\n```\n\n",
