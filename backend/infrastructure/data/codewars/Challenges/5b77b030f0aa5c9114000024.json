  "description": "In this Kata, we define an arithmetic progression as a series of integers in which the differences between adjacent numbers are the same. You will be given an array of ints of `length > 2` and your task will be to convert it into an arithmetic progression by the following rule:\n```Haskell\nFor each element there are exactly three options: an element can be decreased by 1, an element can be increased by 1 \nor it can be left unchanged.\n```\nReturn the minimum number of changes needed to convert the array to an arithmetic progression. If not possible, return `-1`.\n```Haskell\nFor example: \nsolve([1,1,3,5,6,5]) == 4 because [1,1,3,5,6,5] can be changed to [1,2,3,4,5,6] by making 4 changes.\nsolve([2,1,2]) == 1 because it can be changed to [2,2,2]\nsolve([1,2,3]) == 0  because it is already a progression, and no changes are needed.\nsolve([1,1,10) == -1 because it's impossible.\nsolve([5,6,5,3,1,1]) == 4. It becomes [6,5,4,3,2,1]\n```\n\nMore examples in the test cases. Good luck!",
