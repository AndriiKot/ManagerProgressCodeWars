  "description": "The **[Prime](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/144695/the-prime-ant) [ant](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2487116/does-the-prime-ant-ever-backtrack)** ([A293689](http://oeis.org/A293689)) is an obstinate animal that navigates the integers and divides them until there are only primes left, according to the following procedure:\n\n* An infinite array/list `A` is initialized to contain all the integers greater than 1: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, …]`\n* Let `p` be the position of the ant on the array/list. Initially `p = 0`, so the ant is at `A[0] = 2`\n* At each turn, the ant moves as follows:\n  * If `A[p]` is prime, move the ant one position forward, so `p ← p + 1`\n  * Otherwise (if `A[p]` is composite):\n    * Let `q` be its smallest divisor greater than 1\n    * Replace `A[p]` with `A[p] / q`\n    * Replace `A[p−1]` with `A[p−1] + q`\n    * Move the ant one position backward, so `p ← p − 1`\n\nYour task is to comlete the function that computes the position of the prime ant after n turns.\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\nprime_ant(2)   # => 2\nprime_ant(11)  # => 5\nprime_ant(47)  # => 9\n```\n```ruby\nprime_ant(2)   # => 2\nprime_ant(11)  # => 5\nprime_ant(47)  # => 9\n```\n```javascript\nprimeAnt(2)   // => 2\nprimeAnt(11)  // => 5\nprimeAnt(47)  // => 9\n```\n\n---\n\nWhen you're done solving this, you should also try solving [Prime ant - Performance Version](https://www.codewars.com/kata/prime-ant-performance-version/)\n",
