  "description": "In baseball, the batting average is a simple and most common way to measure a hitter's performace.  Batting average is calculated by taking all the players `hits` and dividing it by their number of `at_bats`, and it is usually displayed as a 3 digit decimal (i.e. 0.300).\n\nGiven a `yankees` table with  the following schema,\n\n-`player_id` STRING\n\n-`player_name` STRING\n\n-`primary_position` STRING\n \n-`games`  INTEGER\n\n-`at_bats` INTEGER\n\n-`hits` INTEGER\n\nreturn a table with `player_name`, `games`, and `batting_average`. \n\nWe want `batting_average` to be rounded to the nearest thousandth, since that is how baseball fans are used to seeing it. Format it as text and make sure it has 3 digits to the right of the decimal (pad with zeroes if neccesary).\n\nNext, order our resulting table by `batting_average`, with the highest average in the first row. \n\nFinally, since `batting_average` is a rate statistic, a small number of `at_bats` can change the average dramatically. To correct for this, exclude any player who doesn't have at least 100 at bats. \n\nExpected Output Table\n\n-`player_name` STRING\n\n-`games` INTEGER\n\n-`batting_average` STRING\n\n\n\n",
