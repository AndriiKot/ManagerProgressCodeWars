  "description": "Your job is to figure out the index of which vowel is missing from a given string:\n\n* `A` has an index of 0,\n* `E` has an index of 1, \n* `I` has an index of 2, \n* `O` has an index of 3,\n* `U` has an index of 4.\n\n**Notes:** There is no need for string validation and every sentence given will contain all vowels but one. Also, you won't need to worry about capitals.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n\"John Doe hs seven red pples under his bsket\"          =>  0  ; missing: \"a\"\n\"Bb Smith sent us six neatly arranged range bicycles\"  =>  3  ; missing: \"o\"\n```",
