  "description": "You're going to implement a simple counter class. The counter will start at zero, and every time its `incr` method is called, it will increase by 1.\n\n**There's one caveat:** Your counter must act like a number and support arithmetic operations and comparisons.\n\nFor example:\n\n    var c = new Counter();\n    c.incr(); // counter is now at 1\n    c + 1; // 2\n    c > 1; // false\n    c > 0; // true\n    c == 1; // true\n    Math.sqrt(c); // 1\n\nYou are not required to support equality comparison between two `Counter` instances.",
