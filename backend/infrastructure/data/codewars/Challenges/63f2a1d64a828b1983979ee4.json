  "description": "Write a function named `three_digits_become_six`. The function takes a single parameter, which is a three-digit `integer`. Your function should return a six-digit `integer` that repeats the three-digit number without using `string` methods or `fstrings`. Additionally, the size of your code is limited to `64` characters in length (_inlucding spaces_).\n\n\n## Examples\n\n- `776` becomes `776776`\n- `333` becomes `333333`\n- `187` becomes `187187`\n\n\nYou will always be given a three-digit integer, so no need to validate input ~ Good luck!\n\n",
