  "description": "Congratulations! That Special Someone has given you their phone number.\n\nBut WAIT, is it a valid number? \n\nYour task is to write a function that verifies whether a given string contains a valid British mobile (cell) phone number or not. \n\n* If the string is a valid UK number, return `\"In with a chance\"`.\n\n* If it is invalid, or if you're given an empty string, return `\"Plenty more fish in the sea\"`.\n\nA number can be valid in the following ways: \n\n1. Here in the UK, mobile numbers begin with `\"07\"` followed by 9 other digits, e.g. `\"07454876120\"`.\n\n1. Sometimes the number is preceded by the country code, the prefix `\"+44\"`, which replaces the `\"0\"` in `‘07’`, e.g. `\"+447454876120\"`.\n\n1. And sometimes you will find numbers with dashes in-between digits or on either side, e.g. `\"+44--745---487-6120\"` or `\"-074-54-87-61-20-\"`. As you can see, dashes may be consecutive. \n\nGood Luck Romeo/Juliette! \n",
