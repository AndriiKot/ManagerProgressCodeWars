  "description": "![alt text](http://corkwatersafety.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sets.jpg)\n\nJohnny is a pretty decent surfer and he just discovered a new break with beautiful waves rolling in. \n\nThere is always a set of 3 waves hitting the beach one after another. The wave sizes in each set vary: Johnny never knows which set wave will be the biggest or smallest. \n\nJohnny likes bigger waves between 8 and 10 feet, although anything bigger than 10 feet he wouldn´t surf. \n\n<strong>He surfs according to the following two rules:</strong>\n<li>“If the first wave has a decent size (8-10 feet), I´m gonna take it! Otherwise I´ll wait for the next one!”\n<li>“If I waited for the last wave of the set I´ll take it anyway - as long as it´s not bigger than 10 feet.\"\n\nJohnny´s session is great but the waves are super fast and each time he takes off on a wave bigger than 8 feet he falls off his board. Damn.\n\n<strong>TASK:</strong>\n\nWrite a function that takes in an array representing one set of 3 waves. According wave sizes will always be between 3 and 12 feet.\n\ne.g. <strong>[5,10,6]</strong> could represent a set of waves. \n\nYour function should return an array with the wave size Johnny decides to take and a corresponding statement.\n\nIf Johnny doesn´t take any wave (e.g. because each set wave is too big): Add <strong>\"Johnny waits\"</strong>.\n\nIf Johnny surfs: Add either <strong>\"Johnny falls\"</strong> (if he takes off on a wave bigger than 8 feet) or <strong>\"Johnny rides\"</strong>.\n\nSee test cases for further details.",
