  "description": "I am the father of three wonderful sons. before the beginning of the school year, I promised them that I would buy a bicycle for someone who would bring the best marks at the end of the school year. it's time to keep promises and I count on you.\n\nYou have 3 input objects(school diaries) with school subjects and marks (1-10). For example:\n\n\n```\n{\n  'algebra': 6,\n  'history': 8,\n  'physics': 9,\n  'geography': 2,\n  'chemistry': 9\n}\n\n```\n\nReturn please :\n\n```\n'I need to buy a bicycle for my first son.' // the sum of the marks is the highest  in the first diary.\n\n'I need to buy a bicycle for my second son.' // the sum of the marks is the highest in the second diary.\n\n'I need to buy a bicycle for my third son.' //  the sum of the marks is the highest in the third diary.\n\n```\n\nIf two or three sons have the same highest marks, you need to choose the younger one. Use the ageTable object which is preloaded:\n\n```\nageTable = {\n            'firstSonAge': 14,\n            'secondSonAge': 9,\n            'thirdSonAge': 8\n           }\n\n```\n\n\n",
