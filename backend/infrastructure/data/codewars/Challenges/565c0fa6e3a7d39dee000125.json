  "description": "Braking distance `d1` is the distance a vehicle will go from the point when it brakes to when it comes to a complete stop. \nIt depends on the original speed `v` and on the coefficient of friction `mu` between the tires and the road surface.\n\nThe braking distance is one of two principal components of the total stopping distance. \nThe other component is the reaction distance, which is the product of the speed and the perception-reaction time of the driver.\n\nThe kinetic energy E is `0.5*m*v**2`, the work W given by braking is `mu*m*g*d1`. Equalling E and W gives the braking distance:\n`d1 = v*v / (2*mu*g)` where `g` is the gravity of Earth and `m` the vehicle's mass. \n\nWe have `v` in km per hour, `g` as `9.81 m/s/s` and in the following we suppose that the reaction time\nis constant and equal to `1 s`. The coefficient `mu` is dimensionless.\n\n\n#### Tasks:\n\n- The first one is to calculate the **total** stopping distance in meters given `v`, `mu` \n(and the reaction time `t = 1`).\n  \n  `dist(v, mu) -> d = total stopping distance`\n\n- The second task is to calculate `v` in km per hour knowing `d` in meters and `mu` \nwith the supposition that the reaction time is still `t = 1`.\n\n  `speed(d, mu) -> v such that dist(v, mu) = d`.\n\n\n#### Examples:\n\n```\ndist(100, 0.7) -> 83.9598760937531\n\nspeed(83.9598760937531, 0.7) -> 100.0\n```\n\n#### Notes:\n- Remember to convert the velocity from km/h to m/s or from m/s to km/h when necessary.\n- Don't forget the reaction time t: `t = 1`\n- Don't truncate or round your results. See in \"RUN SAMPLE TESTS\" the function `assertFuzzyEquals` or `dotest or ...`.\n\n~~~if:shell\n- Shell: only `dist` is tested.\n~~~",
