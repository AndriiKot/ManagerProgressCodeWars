  "description": "## Task\n Court is in session. We got a group of witnesses who have all taken an oath to tell the truth. The prosecutor is pointing at the defendants one by one and asking each witnesses a simple question - \"guilty or not?\". The witnesses are allowed to respond in one of the following three ways:\n```\nI am sure he/she is guilty.\nI am sure he/she is innocent.\nI have no idea.\n```\nThe prosecutor has a hunch that one of the witnesses might not be telling the truth so she decides to cross-check all of their testimonies and see if the information gathered is consistent, i.e. there are no two witnesses A and B and a defendant C such that A says C is guilty while B says C is innocent.\n\n## Example\n\n For\n```\nevidences =  [[ 0, 1, 0, 1], \n               [-1, 1, 0, 0], \n               [-1, 0, 0, 1]]\n               \n```\nthe output should be `true`;\n\n For\n```\nevidences =  [[ 1, 0], \n               [-1, 0], \n               [ 1, 1],\n               [ 1, 1]]  \n```\nthe output should be `false`.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` 2D integer array `evidences`\n\n    2-dimensional array of integers representing the set of testimonials. evidences[i][j] is the testimonial of the ith witness on the jth defendant. -1 means `\"innocent\"`, 0 means `\"no idea\"`, and 1 means `\"guilty\"`.\n\n    Constraints:\n\n    `2 ≤ evidences.length ≤ 5,`\n\n    `2 ≤ evidences[0].length ≤ 10.`\n\n\n - `[output]` a boolean value\n\n    `true` if the evidence is consistent, `false` otherwise.",
