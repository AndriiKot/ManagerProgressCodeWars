  "description": "I have the `par` value for each hole on a golf course and my stroke `score` on each hole. I have them stored as strings, because I wrote them down on a sheet of paper.  Right now, I'm using those strings to calculate my golf score by hand: take the difference between my actual `score` and the `par` of the hole, and add up the results for all 18 holes.\n\nFor example:\n* If I took 7 shots on a hole where the par was 5, my score would be: 7 - 5 = 2\n* If I got a hole-in-one where the par was 4, my score would be: 1 - 4 = -3.\n\nDoing all this math by hand is really hard! Can you help make my life easier?\n\n\n## Task Overview\n\nComplete the function which accepts two strings and calculates the golf score of a game. Both strings will be of length 18, and each character in the string will be a number between 1 and 9 inclusive. ",
