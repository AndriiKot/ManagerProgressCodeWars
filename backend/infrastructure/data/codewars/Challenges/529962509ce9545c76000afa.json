  "description": "Connect Four is a game in which two players take turns dropping red or yellow colored discs into a vertically suspended 7 x 6 grid. Discs fall to the bottom of the grid, occupying the next available space.\n\nA player wins by connecting four of their discs horizontally, vertically or diagonally.\n\nGiven a multidimensional array representing a Connect Four board, your task is to create a  function which can determine who won the game.\n\nYour `connectFour` function will be passed an array matrix similar to this:\n\n```javascript\n[['-','-','-','-','-','-','-'],\n ['-','-','-','-','-','-','-'],\n ['-','-','-','R','R','R','R'],\n ['-','-','-','Y','Y','R','Y'],\n ['-','-','-','Y','R','Y','Y'],\n ['-','-','Y','Y','R','R','R']];\n```\n`'R'` represents a red disc\n\n`'Y'` represents a yellow disc\n\n`'-'` represents an unoccupied space\n\nIn this example the red player won by making a horizontal line of 4 red discs.\n\nIf the red player won, your `connectFour` function should return `'R'`. If the yellow player won, it should return `'Y'`. If the board is full and no one won it should return `'draw'`. If the game is still in progress it should return `'in progress'`. \n\nYou can learn more about how Connect Four is played here: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four",
