  "description": "As a database manager, you're tasked with reviewing user roles to enhance system security. Your objective: Identify users with exclusively 'admin' or 'internal' roles, but not both, mirroring the XOR (exclusive OR) logic. This will aid in refining role-based access controls in the organization.\n\nWe have a table named `user_roles` with the following structure:\n\n* `id` (integer): the unique identifier of the record.\n* `username` (string) - the username of the user.\n* `role` (string) - the role assigned to the user. Can be 'admin', 'internal', or 'external'.\n\nYou need to write an SQL query which identifies users who have either the role `admin` or `internal`, but not both. \n\nThe result should be sorted by `usernamre` in ascending alphabetical order and have the following columns:\n\n* `username` (string)\n* `internal` (boolean) - has the value of `true` if the user has the 'internal' role and `false` otherwise.\n* `admin` (boolean) - has the value of `true` if the user has the 'admin' role and `false` otherwise.\n\nThus, on the concrete example, for this sample data:\n\n ```\n id | username |   role   \n---+----------+----------\n 1  | name1    | internal\n 2  | name1    | admin\n 3  | name2    | internal\n 4  | name3    | admin\n 5  | name4    | external\n ```\n \n we need to get the following result:\n \n```\n username | internal | admin \n----------+----------+---------\n name2    |  true    |  false   \n name3    |  false   |  true   \n ```\n\nGLHF!\n \nNotes:\n\n* there are no duplicates for username/role pairs \n \n\n",
