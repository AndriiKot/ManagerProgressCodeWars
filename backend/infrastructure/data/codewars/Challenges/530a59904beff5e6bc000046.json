  "description": "The mathematical constant *e* has numerous applications in mathematics, science, and engineering. Additionally, *e* is an irrational number, and cannot be computed to a finite number of digits, similar to *pi*. While there are many methods of approximating `e`, one of the first, credited to the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, is to consider [continuously compounded interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28mathematical_constant%29#History).\n\nDefine a method `approximate_e` that takes a `Float` or `Fixnum` (`n`), which is greater than or equal to 1, and returns a `Float` approximation based on Bernoulli's discovery in 1683 (refer to Wikipedia for more information). Also, approximate_e should be able to take any input for `n` – Booleans, Strings, `nil`, or even no argument at all – in which cases it should return Math::E. The same should be returned if `n` is an invalid `Float`.\n\n\n> **Note:** Ruby provides the constant `Math::E` that gives a constant approximation of `e`, however, this probably won't help you very much, as the approximation does not vary given a parameter. It's probably more work to cheat!",
