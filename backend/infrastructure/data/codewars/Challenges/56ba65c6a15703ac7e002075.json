  "description": "We have the number ```12385``` . We want to know the value of the closest cube but higher than 12385. The answer will be ```13824``` .\n\nNow, another case. We have the number ```1245678``` . We want to know the 5th power, closest and higher than that number. The value will be ```1419857```.\n\nWe need a function that receives two arguments, a value ```val``` , and the exponent of the power, ``` pow_``` , and outputs the value that we want to find.\n\nLet'see some cases:\n```\n(12385, 3) ==> 13824\n(1245678, 5) ==> 1419857\n```\nThe value, ```val``` will be always a positive integer.\n\nThe power, ```pow_``` , always higher than ```1``` .\n\nHappy coding!!",
