  "description": "You will be given a string with sets of characters, (i.e. words), seperated by between one and four spaces (inclusive).\n\nLooking at the first letter of each word (case insensitive-`\"A\"` and `\"a\"` should be treated the same), you need to determine whether it falls into the positive/first half of the alphabet (`\"a\"`-`\"m\"`) or the negative/second half (`\"n\"`-`\"z\"`).\n\nReturn `True/true` if there are more (or equal) positive words than negative words, `False/false` otherwise.\n```\n\"A big brown fox caught a bad rabbit\" => True/true\n\"Xylophones can obtain Xenon.\" => False/false\n```",
