  "description": "# Task\n Let's say that number a feels comfortable with number b if a ≠ b and b lies in the segment` [a - s(a), a + s(a)]`, where `s(x)` is the sum of x's digits.\n\n How many pairs (a, b) are there, such that a < b, both a and b lie on the segment `[L, R]`, and each number feels comfortable with the other?\n\n# Example\n\n For `L = 10 and R = 12`, the output should be `2`\n\n Here are all values of s(x) to consider:\n```\ns(10) = 1, so 10 is comfortable with 9 and 11;\ns(11) = 2, so 11 is comfortable with 9, 10, 12 and 13;\ns(12) = 3, so 12 is comfortable with 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 15.\nThus, there are 2 pairs of numbers comfortable \nwith each other within the segment [10; 12]: \n(10, 11) and (11, 12).\n```\n# Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` integer `L`\n\n    Constraints: `1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 1000`\n\n - `[input]` integer `R`\n\n    Constraints: `1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 1000`\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\n    The number of pairs satisfying all the above conditions.",
