  "description": "`1 < 2 < 3 === true` right? but could\n\n`3 < 2 < 1 === true` too??\n\nHere's your puzzle: Write a function `greaterThanLessThan` that takes three arguments, a, b, and c, and returns a boolean (true or false), such that:\n\n```\ngreaterThanLessThan(1, 2 3) === true\n```\n\nand\n\n```\ngreaterThanLessThan(3, 2 1) === true\n```\n\nBut also\n\n```\ngraterThanLessThan(-3, -2, -1) == false\n```\n\nwith more examples on the expected behavior in the test cases.\n\n## Hints\n\n1. Arguments do not necessarily have to be in strict ascending or descending order, as indicated by the example test cases.\n\n  Check out the included test cases - not all arguments are going to return true! It's up to you to figure out which ones do and which ones don't. \n\n2. This challenge is a LOT easier than it might seem at first. Don't focus too much on building functions - just pay attention to precedence.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n```\nNeed some pointers? Brush up on your operator precedence here and you'll figure it out:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence\n\nDon't forget your primitives either:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive\n```\n",
