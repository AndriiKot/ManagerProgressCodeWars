  "description": "Tolkein's publisher wishes to implement an online store for the \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Hobbit\" books. Each book costs $10. However, if 2 titles are purchased, a 5% discount will be received, i.e. purchasing \"Fellowship of the Ring\" and \"Two Towers\" will cost $19. If 3 different titles are purchased, a 10% discount will be received. The purchase of all 4 different titles will receive a 20% discount. An additional single title will be full-price.\n\nThe encoding of an order will be in the form of strings in an array. For example: `[“F”, “T”, “R”, “H”, “H”]` is the encoding of 2 copies of \"The Hobbit\" and a single copy of each of the titles in the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.\n\nThe expected output is a number. E.g. `42` is the expected output for the example above.\nThe output should be the cheapest total cost. For example - if the book order is `[\"F\", \"T\", \"H\", \"F\", \"T\", \"R\"]`, valid total costs include `(3*10 discounted by 10%) + (3*10 discounted by 10%)` and `(4*10 discounted by 20%) + (2*10 discounted by 5%)`. The cheapest total cost is `51`.\n\nThis is a slightly simplified version of http://codingdojo.org/kata/Potter/",
