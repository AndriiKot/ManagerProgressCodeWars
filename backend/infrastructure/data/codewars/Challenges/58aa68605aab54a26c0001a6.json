  "description": "# Task\n The year of `2013` is the first year after the old `1987` with only distinct digits.\n\n Now your task is to solve the following problem: given a `year` number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `year`\n\n `1000 ≤ year ≤ 9000`\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\n  the minimum year number that is strictly larger than the input number `year` and all its digits are distinct.",
