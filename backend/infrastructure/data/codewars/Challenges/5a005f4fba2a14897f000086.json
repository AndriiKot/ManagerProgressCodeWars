  "description": "You get an array of different numbers to sum up. But there is one problem, those numbers all have different bases.\nFor example:\n```javascript\nYou get an array of numbers with their base as an input:\n\n[[\"101\",16],[\"7640\",8],[\"1\",9]]\n```\n```python\nYou get an array of numbers with their base as an input:\n\n[[\"101\",16],[\"7640\",8],[\"1\",9]]\n```\n\n```java\nYou get an array of BasedNumbers as an input:\n\npublic class BasedNumbers {\n  public final String number;\n  public final int base;\n}\n\n[\n  {number: \"101\", base: 16},\n  {number: \"7640\", base: 8},\n  {number: \"1\", base: 9}\n]\n```\nThe output should be the sum as an integer value with a base of 10, so according to the example this would be:\n\n4258\n```javascript\nA few more examples:\n[[\"101\",2], [\"10\",8]] --> 13\n[[\"ABC\",16], [\"11\",2]] --> 2751\n```\n```python\nA few more examples:\n[[\"101\",2], [\"10\",8]] --> 13\n[[\"ABC\",16], [\"11\",2]] --> 2751\n```\n```java\nA few more examples:\n[{number: \"101\", base: 2}, {number: \"10\", base: 8}] --> 13\n[{number: \"ABC\", base: 16}, {number: \"11\", base: 2}] --> 2751\n```\nBases can be between 2 and 36 (2<=base<=36)",
