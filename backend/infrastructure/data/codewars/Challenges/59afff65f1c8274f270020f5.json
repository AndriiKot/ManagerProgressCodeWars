  "description": "Imagine two rings with numbers on them. The inner ring spins clockwise (decreasing by 1 each spin) and the outer ring spins counter clockwise (increasing by 1 each spin). We start with both rings aligned on 0 at the top, and on each move we spin each ring one increment. How many moves will it take before both rings show the same number at the top again?\n\nThe inner ring has integers from 0 to innerMax and the outer ring has integers from 0 to outerMax, where innerMax and outerMax are integers >= 1.\n\n```\ne.g. if innerMax is 2 and outerMax is 3 then after\n1 move: inner = 2, outer = 1\n2 moves: inner = 1, outer = 2\n3 moves: inner = 0, outer = 3\n4 moves: inner = 2, outer = 0\n5 moves: inner = 1, outer = 1\nTherefore it takes 5 moves for the two rings to reach the same number\nTherefore spinningRings(2, 3) = 5\n```\n```\ne.g. if innerMax is 3 and outerMax is 2 then after\n1 move: inner = 3, outer = 1\n2 moves: inner = 2, outer = 2\nTherefore it takes 2 moves for the two rings to reach the same number\nspinningRings(3, 2) = 2\n```\n\n---\n\nfor a bigger challenge, check out the [Performance Version](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59b0b7cd2a00d219ab0000c5) of this kata by @Voile",
