  "description": "As a newly hired developer at a startup, you've been tasked with refactoring the existing codebase. As usually happens in startups, the initial code has been written by a bunch of students that were doing it for free. Sinking more and more into depression as you study the code, you stumbled upon this gem:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM (\n  SELECT DISTINCT city_name FROM stations WHERE city_name LIKE 'A%'\n  UNION\n  SELECT DISTINCT city_name FROM stations WHERE city_name LIKE 'E%'\n  UNION\n  SELECT DISTINCT city_name FROM stations WHERE city_name LIKE 'I%'\n  UNION\n  SELECT DISTINCT city_name FROM stations WHERE city_name LIKE 'O%'\n  UNION\n  SELECT DISTINCT city_name FROM stations WHERE city_name LIKE 'U%'\n) AS subquery\nORDER BY city_name ASC;\n```\nYou need to do the refactoring of the above query without using the `UNION` operator.\n\nThe schema of `stations` table is following:\n\n* `id` (integer): primary key\n* `city_name` (string): the name of the city\n\nGLHF!\n",
