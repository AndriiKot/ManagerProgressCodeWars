  "description": "The [State Design Pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZt7mUVDijU) can be used, for example, to manage the state of a tank in the StarCraft game.\n\nThe pattern consists in isolating the state logic in different classes rather than having multiple `if`s to determine what should happen.\n\n## Your Task\n\nComplete the code so that when a `Tank` goes into `SiegeMode` it cannot move and its damage goes to `20`. When it goes to `TankMode` it should be able to move and the damage should be set to `5`.\n\nYou have 3 classes:\n\n  - `Tank`: has a `state`, `canMove` and `damage` properties\n  - `SiegeState` and `TankState`: has `canMove` and `damage` properties\n\n**Note**: The tank initial state should be `TankState`.\n\n## Resources\n\n  - [PatternCraft > State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZt7mUVDijU)\n  - [SourceMaking > State](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/state)\n  - [Wikipedia > State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern)\n\n# PatternCraft series\n\n  - **State Pattern**\n  - [Strategy Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-strategy/)\n  - [Visitor Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-visitor/)\n  - [Decorator Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-decorator/)\n  - [Adapter Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-adapter/)\n  - [Command Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-command/)\n\nThe original [PatternCraft series (by John Lindquist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8B19C3040F6381A2) is a collection of Youtube videos that explains some of the design patterns and how they are used (or could be) on StarCraft.\n",
