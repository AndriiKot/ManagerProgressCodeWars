  "description": "Sherlock has to find suspect on his latest case. He will use your method, dear Watson. The suspect in this case is a number which is most unique in given list, e.g.:\n\n- has least (minimum) occurences in list \n- and no other number has the same occurences count\n\nWrite method which helps Sherlock to find suspect from given list of numbers. If no suspect is found the method should return nil.\n\n### Examples\n\n```ruby\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4]  # => 3\nnumbers = [1, 1, 2, 2]  # => nil\nnumbers = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]  # => 1\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3]  # => nil\n```",
