  "description": "All Unix user know the command line `history`. This one comes with a set of useful commands know as the `bang` command. \n\nFor more information about the history command line you can take a look at: \n\n- The man page -> simply type `man history` in your terminal.\n- The online man page [here](https://linux.die.net/man/3/history).\n- And for more information about the `bang` command you can read [this article](http://jaysoo.ca/2009/09/16/unix-history-and-bang-commands/)\n\nFor this second kata we will explore the `!n` command, according to the man page this one refer to command line n.\n\nIn this kata you should complete a function that take in an integer that correspond to `n`, and an `history` with the following format: \n\n```\n  1  cd /pub\n  2  more beer\n  3  lost\n  4  ls \n  5  touch me \n  6  chmod 000 me \n  7  more me\n  8  history\n```\n\nand that should return the `n`th executed command line, for example with `n`=4 and the above history it should return `ls`. If user ask for a `n` without any know entry for example `n=12` here, the function should return `!12: event not found`. **Note**: For this kata we will assume that `n >= 1`.\n\n**Note**: Lot of the command line comes form some geeky t-shirt and form this [excellent page](http://langevin.univ-tln.fr/cours/UPS/extra/unix-shell-jokes.txt).\n\n\n",
