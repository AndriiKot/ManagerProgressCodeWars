  "description": "### The task\n\nYour task, is to calculate the minimal number of moves to win the game \"Towers of Hanoi\", with given number of disks.\n\n### What is \"Towers of Hanoi\"?\n\nTowers of Hanoi is a simple game consisting of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.\n\nThe objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:\n\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.\n3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n",
