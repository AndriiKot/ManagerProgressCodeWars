  "description": "You are given a table named `data` with a single column `num` of type integer. The numbers in this column are supposed to be sequential (in ascending order), but some numbers are missing.\n\nYour task is to write a SQL query to find the first missing number in the sequence.\n\nHere's an example of what the data table might look like:\n\n```\n num\n-----\n  1\n  2\n  4\n  5\n  6\n  8\n  9\n 11\n ```\n \n\nFor the given example data, your query should return the following result:\n\n```\n missing_number\n---------------\n            3\n```\n\nNotes: \n\n* The values in the `num` column will be unique \n\nGLHF!\n",
