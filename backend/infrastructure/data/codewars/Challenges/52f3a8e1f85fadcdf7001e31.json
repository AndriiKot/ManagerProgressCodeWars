  "description": "You have to define a function to calculate the division of two factorial numbers.\nThis can be useful for large numbers.\n\nIn mathematics, the factorial of integer `n` is written as `n!`. It is equal to the product of `n` and every integer preceding it. For example: `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.\n\nSome hints:\nWe can see that `(n + 1)! = (n + 1) * n!`.\nSo `(n + 1)! / n! = (n + 1)`\n\nWe know that `0! = 1` (because `n! = (n + 1)! / (n + 1)` therefore `0! = 1! / 1 = 1`)\n\nAnd your solution should be able to calculate `n! / d!`.\n\n*** Please, don't worry about the parameters. You will only receive positive integers, and the first one will be greater than the second one\n",
