  "description": "Consider the number triangle below, in which each number is equal to the number above plus the number to the left. If there is no number above, assume it's a `0`.\n\n```haskell\n1\n1 1\n1 2 2\n1 3 5 5\n1 4 9 14 14\n```\nThe triangle has `5` rows and the sum of the last row is `sum([1,4,9,14,14]) = 42`.\n\nYou will be given an integer `n` and your task will be to return the sum of the last row of a triangle of `n` rows. \n\nIn the example above:\n```haskell\nsolve(5) = 42\n```\nMore examples in test cases. Good luck!\n\n```if:javascript\n### Note\n\nThis kata uses native arbitrary precision integer numbers ( `BigInt`, `1n` ).  \nUnfortunately, the testing framework and even native `JSON` do not fully support them yet.  \n`console.log(1n)` and `(1n).toString()` work and can be used for debugging.  \n\nWe apologise for the inconvenience.\n```",
