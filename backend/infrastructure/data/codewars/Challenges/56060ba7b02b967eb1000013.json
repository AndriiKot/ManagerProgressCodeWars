  "description": "The number six has this interesting property, and is the smallest number in having it (after the integer ```1``` that obviously fulfills this condition):\nIts cube, is divisible by the sum of its divisors.\nLet's see it:\n\n```\n6 ^ 3 = 216\ndivisors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6\nsum of its divisors= 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12\nAnd 216 / 12 = 18 (integer) and 18.12 = 216\n```\nThe first terms of this sequence are:\n```\nn    a(n)\n1       6 \n2      28\n3      30\n4      84\n5     102\n```\nYour challenge is to create a function that receives an ordinal number `n` of the term of the sequence as an argument, and returns the `nth` term of that sequece of integers.\n\nLet's see some cases (input ------> output):\n```\n4 ------> 84\n/// divisors of 84 : 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84\n    sum of divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 12 + 14 + 21 + 28 + 42 + 84 = 224\n    cube of 84 = 84^3 = 592704\n    592704 is a multiple of 224///\n\n5 ------> 102\n```\nYour code should use memoization in order to have higher speed for testing. Does your code reach up to the 120-th term? We can get this upper limit in the tests.\n\nEnjoy it and happy coding!!",
