  "description": "# Task\n\nAfter a long night (work, play, study) you find yourself sleeping on a bench in a park. As you wake up and try to figure out what happened you start counting trees.\n\nYou notice there are different tree sizes but there's always one size which is unbalanced. For example there are 2 size 2, 2 size 1 and 1 size 3. (then the size 3 is unbalanced)\n\nGiven an array representing different tree sizes. Which one is the unbalanced size.\n\n# Notes\n\n```\nThere can be any number of sizes but one is always unbalanced\nThe unbalanced size is always one less than the other sizes\nThe array is not ordered (nor the trees)\n```\n\n# Examples\n\nFor `trees = [1,1,2,2,3]`, the result should be `3`.\n\nFor `trees = [2,2,2,56,56,56,8,8]`, the result should be `8`.\n\nFor `trees = [34,76,12,99,64,99,76,12,34]`, the result should be `64`.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n- `[input]` integer array `trees`\n\n  Array representing different tree sizes\n\n- `[output]` an integer\n\n  The size of the missing tree.",
