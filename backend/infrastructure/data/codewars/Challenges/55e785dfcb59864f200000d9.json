  "description": "Some numbers have the property to be divisible by 2 and 3.\nOther smaller subset of numbers have the property to be divisible by 2, 3 and 5.\nAnother subset with less abundant numbers may be divisible by 2, 3, 5 and 7.\nThese numbers have something in common: their prime factors are contiguous primes.\n\nImplement a function that finds the amount of numbers that have the first `N` primes as factors below a given limit.\n\nLet's see some cases:\n\n```\ncount_specMult(3, 200)  =>  6 \n\nThe first 3 primes are: 2, 3 and 5.\n\nAnd the found numbers below 200 are: 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180.\n```\n\nHappy coding!!",
