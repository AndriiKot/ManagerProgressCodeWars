  "description": "<center>The Return of the <big>[Revenge](https://www.codewars.com/kata/598a48baae35d17bc500001d) </big> of <big> [Hall Of Fame](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59879e52704c4f96540000c1)</big></center>\n>\" *It should be good to **stay** in the Hall of Fame . . .* \"\n\nSo unfair ! Other players with same score as you, may put you out of the Hall due to name-sorting-rule ! ! ! (better to be named anjinxin than zozo...)\n\nThings should change now !\n\n\n## Task\nCreate a function `hallOfFame(players)` which return an ordered list of sub-arrays of players with same score.\n\n#### Input :\n* list of `players`\n* each `player` is a 2-items array of the form `[name, score]`\n\n\n#### Output :\n* list of **3 best** `ranks`\n* each `rank` is an array of the form `[score, name1 (,name2, (name3,...) )]` with names of each player with same score.\n* `ranks` should be sorted from best score (==higher) to \"worst\" (lower).\n\n\n*eg*:\n```\nhallOfFame([\"Aya\",5], [\"Ben\",9], [\"Clo\",5], [\"Dan\",7]) // -> [ [9,\"Ben\"], [7, \"Dan\"], [5, \"Aya\", \"Clo\"] ]\n```\n* when more than 1 player have the same score, they should be sorted alphabeticaly (`[42, \"Xin\",\"Yang\",\"Zhu\"] not [42, \"Yang\", \"Zhu\", \"Xin\"]`)\n\n#### Important\n\nIn case of equality in first places, next ones will be moved. It means :\n* If 2 players share the 1st rank, next one(s) move to 3rd rank.\n* If more than 2 players share the 1st rank other players can't figure on the podium.\n* If there is only one \"1st player\" but more than one \"2d players\" then \"3rd\" rank is inoccupied.\n\nIn these cases \"empty\" ranks should figure in returned array as empty sub-arrays : `[ [123,\"Xin\",\"Yang\",\"Zhu\"], [], [] ]`\n\n#### Examples :\n\n```\nhallOfFame([\"Aya\",9], [\"Ben\",9], [\"Clo\",9], [\"Dan\",8.99])\n  // -> [ [9, \"Aya\", \"Ben\", \"Clo\"], [], [] ] : 3 players on 1st place no 2nd nor 3rd rank allowed)\n  \nhallOfFame([\"Aya\",9], [\"Ben\",9], [\"Clo\",8], [\"Dan\",7.99])\n  // -> [ [9,\"Aya\",\"Ben\"], [], [8,\"Clo\"]  ] : 2 players on 1st place -> \"2nd\" score goes to 3rd rank\n  \nhallOfFame([\"Aya\",9], [\"Ben\",8], [\"Clo\",8], [\"Dan\",7.99])\n  // -> [ [9,\"Aya\"], [8,\"Ben\",\"Clo\"], []  ] : 1 \"1st player\", 2 \"2nd players\" -> no place for the 3rd\n  \nhallOfFame([\"Aya\",9], [\"Ben\",8], [\"Clo\",7], [\"Dan\",6.99])\n  // -> [ [9,\"Aya\"], [8,\"Ben\"], [7,\"Clo\"]  ] :  each first places occupied by only 1 player\n```\n\nDon't give up, stay in the Top !\n\n",
