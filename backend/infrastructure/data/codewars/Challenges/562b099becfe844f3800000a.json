  "description": "Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, `134468`.\n\nSimilarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, `66420`.\n\nWe shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a \"bouncy\" number; for example, `155349`.\n\nClearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just over half of the numbers below one-thousand (`525`) are bouncy. In fact, the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first reaches 50% is `538`.\n\nSurprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time we reach `21780` the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to 90%.\n\n#### Your Task\n\nComplete the `bouncyRatio` function.\n\nThe input will be the target ratio.\n\nThe output should be the smallest number such that the proportion of bouncy numbers reaches the target ratio.\n\nYou should throw an `Error` for a ratio less than 0% or greater than 99%.\n\n**Source**\n\n  - https://projecteuler.net/problem=112\n  \n**Updates**\n\n  - 26/10/2015: Added a higher precision test case.",
