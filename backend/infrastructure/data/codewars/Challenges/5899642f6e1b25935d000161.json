  "description": "You are given two sorted arrays that contain only integers. These arrays may be sorted in either ascending or descending order. Your task is to merge them into a single array, ensuring that:\n\n* The resulting array is sorted in ascending order.\n\n* Any duplicate values are removed, so each integer appears only once.\n\n* If both input arrays are empty, return an empty array.\n\nNo input validation is needed, as both arrays are guaranteed to contain zero or more integers.\n\n\n## Examples (input -> output)\n```\n* [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n* [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [10, 8, 6, 4, 2] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\n* [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12]\n```\n\nHappy coding!\n",
