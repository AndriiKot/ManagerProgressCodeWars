  "description": "When it's spring Japanese cherries blossom, it's called \"sakura\" and it's admired a lot. The petals start to fall in late April.\n\nSuppose that the falling speed of a petal is 5 centimeters per second (5 cm/s), and it takes 80 seconds for the petal to reach the ground from a certain branch.\n\nWrite a function that receives the speed (in cm/s) of a petal as input, and returns the time it takes for that petal to reach the ground **from the same branch**.\n\nNotes:\n* The movement of the petal is quite complicated, so in this case we can see the velocity as a constant during its falling.\n* Pay attention to the data types.\n* If the initial velocity is non-positive, the return value should be `0`",
