  "description": "We have got a gun that shoots little balls of painting of different colours. We want to calculate the probability in having a certain number of shots with certain colours in a specific order.\n\nBefore start shooting, the balls are mixed in such way that each ball has the same probabilty of being selected to be shot. This action is repeated after each shot.\n\nFor example the gun will be feed with a total of `18` balls: `9` yellow, `4` red and `5` blue. Like the sets we have below.\n\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/wV5abKp\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/wV5abKp.png?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nWe want to know the probabilty for this set of balls (`balls_set`) in having the following event that has 4 consecutive shots: ```e1 = [\"RD\", \"YL\", \"YL\", \"BL\"]```.\n\nRD means Red, YL means Yellow and BL means Blue\n\nThe probability will be:\n```\np(e1) = 4/18 * 9/17 * 8/16 * 5/15 = 1440/73440 = 1/51\n```\n\nBut the following event, for the same balls_set, is impossible for this event of 5 shots:\n`e2 = [\"RD\", \"YL\", \"YL\", \"BL\", \"GN\"]`\n`p(e2) = 0`. The new one here is GN, GN means green. There are no green balls in the set given above.\n\nYou will be given an unordered set of balls with different colours and a desired event. The balls_set has full words for the names of the colours (first letter in Capital letters) as an array. The event is an array, too, but has the corresponding abbreviation for the color. (see the table bellow). You should output the probability of the desired event as a non-reducible fraction with its numerator and denominator in an array, `[num, den]` (num and den should be co-primes).\n\nThe examples given above will be:\n\n``` python\nset_balls = [\"Red\",\"Red\",\"Blue\",\"Yellow\",\"Yellow\",\"Yellow\",\"Red\", \"Yellow\",\"Yellow\",\"Blue\",\"Yellow\",\"Red\",\"Blue\",\"Yellow\",\"Blue\",\"Yellow\",\"Blue\",Yellow\"]\ne = [\"RD\", \"YL\", \"YL\", \"BL\"]\nfind_prob(set_balls, e1) === [1,51]\n```\nAnd the above case when the probability is 0, the function will output an array with the word \"Impossible\" in it.\n\n``` python\nset_balls = [\"Red\",\"Red\",\"Blue\",\"Yellow\",\"Yellow\",\"Yellow\",\"Red\", \"Yellow\",\"Yellow\",\"Blue\",\"Yellow\",\"Red\",\"Blue\",\"Yellow\",\"Blue\",\"Yellow\",\"Blue\",Yellow\"]\ne = [\"RD\", \"YL\", \"YL\", \"BL,\"GN\"]\nfind_prob(set_balls, e1) === ['Impossible']\n```\nYou sould have in mind that events with very low probability very close to 0 are **improbable**, but events with probability equals to 0 are **impossible**\nThe following table shows the correspondent abreviations with all the possible colours of balls that are available for this kata.\n\n```\nAbbreviation        Color \nAL                  Aluminum \nAM                  Amber \nBG                  Beige \nBK                  Black \nBL                  Blue \nBN                  Brown \nBZ                  Bronze \nCH                  Charcoal \nCL                  Clear \nGD                  Gold \nGN                  Green \nGY                  Gray \nGT                  Granite \nIV                  Ivory \nLT                  Light  \nOL                  Olive \nOP                  Opaque \nOR                  Orange \nPK                  Pink \nRD                  Red \nSM                  Smoke \nTL                  Translucent \nTN                  Tan \nTP                  Transparent \nVT                  Violet \nWT                  White \nYL                  Yellow \n```\nThe dictionary ABBREVIATIONS (in Ruby $ABBREVIATIONS) has been preloaded for you to speed up the creation of your solution.\n\nFeatures of the Random Tests:\n```\nlength of balls_set (total amount of balls) between 20 and 100000\namount of events according to the amount of total balls\n```\nMore cases in the example tests.\n\nThe gun has a huge deposit to charge incredible amount of painting balls.\n\nEnjoy it!",
