  "description": "A website named \"All for Five\", sells many products to registered clients that cost all the same (5 dollars, the price is not relevant).\nEvery user receives an ```alphanumeric id code```, like ```D085```.\nThe page tracks all the purchases, that the clients do. For each purchase of a certain client, his/her id user will be registered once.\n\nYou will be given an uncertain number of arrays that contains strings (the id code users). Each array will represent the purchases that the users do in a month.\nYou should find the total number of purchases of the users that have bought in **all the given months** (the clients that their id code are present in all the arrays). \ne.g.:\n``` \na1 = ['A042', 'B004', 'A025', 'A042', 'C025']\na2 = ['B009', 'B040', 'B004', 'A042', 'A025', 'A042']\na3 = ['A042', 'A025', 'B004']\n``` \nThe result will be:\n``` \n'A042'---> 5 times\n'A025'---> 3 times\n'B004'---> 3 times\n``` \nIt may be that not even a single user has purchased in all the months\n``` \na1 = ['A043', 'B004', 'A025', 'A042', 'C025']\na2 = ['B009', 'B040', 'B003', 'A042', 'A027', 'A044']\na3 = ['A041', 'A026', 'B005']\n``` \nEven though '0042' is present in two arrays, is not present in all the arrays.\n\nThe function that solves this challenge will be called as:\n```id_best_users()```. \n\nThe entries of the function and the output for the cases above will be:\n```python\na1 = ['A042', 'B004', 'A025', 'A042', 'C025']\na2 = ['B009', 'B040', 'B004', 'A042', 'A025', 'A042']\na3 = ['A042', 'A025', 'B004']\nid_best_users(a1, a2, a3) == [[5, ['A042']], [3, ['A025', 'B004']]]\n\na1 = ['A043', 'B004', 'A025', 'A042', 'C025']\na2 = ['B009', 'B040', 'B003', 'A042', 'A027', 'A044']\na3 = ['A041', 'A026', 'B005']\nid_best_users(a1, a2, a3) == []\n``` \nAs you can see the output will have the total number of purchases in decreasing order. If two users have the same amount of total purchases, they will be sorted by their id user string value. \n\nMore examples will be given in the example tests.\n\nFeatures of the Random Tests:\n``` \nLow Performance Tests\nmaximum amount of users: 200\nmaximum number of months: 8\nmaximum amount of purchases per month: 100\n\nHigh Performance Tests\nmaximum amount of users: 90000\nmaximum number of months: 12\nmaximum amount of purchases per month: 80000\n```\nEnjoy it!!",
