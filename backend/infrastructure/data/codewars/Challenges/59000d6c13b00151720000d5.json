  "description": "# Task\n We call letter `x` a counterpart of letter `y`, if `x` is the `i`th letter of the English alphabet, and `y` is the `(27 - i)`th for each valid `i` (1-based). For example, `'z'` is the counterpart of `'a'` and vice versa, `'y'` is the counterpart of `'b'`, and so on.\n\n A properly closed bracket word (`PCBW`) is such a `word` that its first letter is the counterpart of its last letter, its second letter is the counterpart of its last by one letter, and so on.\n\n Determine if the given `word` is a `PCBW` or not.\n\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` string `word`\n\n  A string consisting of lowercase letters.\n  \n  `0 < word.length ≤ 30`\n\n\n - `[output]` a boolean value\n\n  `true` if word is a `PCBW`, `false` otherwise.\n\n# Example\n\n For `word = \"abiryz\"`, the output should be `true`.\n \n `'a' is the counterpart of 'z';`\n \n `'b' <-> 'y'`\n \n `'i' <-> 'r'`\n \n For `word = \"aibryz\"`, the output should be `false`.\n \n For `word = \"abitryz\"`, the output should be `false`.",
