  "description": "# Be Concise II - I Need Squares\n\nYou are given a program ```squaresOnly``` that accepts an array of natural numbers **up to and including ```100```** (and including ```0```) of ```length >= 1```, ```array```, and returns a new array containing only square numbers that have appeared in the input array.\n\nRefactor the solution to use as few characters as possible.  There is a maximum character limit of **127**.  Here are a few hints:\n\n1. There are a lot of handy built-in ```Array``` methods in Javascript that you may have never heard of even after completing a basic course in Javascript (e.g. those provided by Codecademy) - well, at least I haven't heard of until quite recently.  You may also want to research any new built-in methods offered by **ES6**, the newest specification of Javascript at the time of writing.\n2. Don't you think the ```array``` parameter is a bit wordy? ;)\n\nGood luck! :D",
