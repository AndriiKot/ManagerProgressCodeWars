  "description": "In this Kata you must convert integers numbers from and to a negative-base binary system.\n\nNegative-base systems can accommodate all the same numbers as standard place-value systems, but both positive and negative numbers are represented without the use of a minus sign (or, in computer representation, a sign bit); this advantage is countered by an increased complexity of arithmetic operations.\n\nTo help understand, the first eight digits (in decimal) of the Base(-2) system is: \n\n`[1, -2, 4, -8, 16, -32, 64, -128]`\n\n\nExample conversions:\n\n`Decimal, negabinary`\n```\n6,   '11010'\n-6,  '1110'\n4,   '100'\n18,  '10110'\n-11, '110101'\n```",
