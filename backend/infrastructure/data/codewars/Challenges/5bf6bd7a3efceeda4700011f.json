  "description": "Your task is to write a regular expression that matches positive decimal integers divisible by 4.\nNegative numbers should be rejected, but leading zeroes are permitted.\n\nRandom tests can consist of numbers, ascii letters, some puctuation and brackets.\nBut no need to check for line breaks (\\n) and non-ASCII chatracters, nothing that fancy in the tests.\n\nThere is 50 characters limit for this regex to avoid hardcoding and keep the \"puzzle\" status :)\nGood luck!\n\n\n",
