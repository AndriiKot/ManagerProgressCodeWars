  "description": "Given a square matrix, rotate the original matrix 90 degrees clockwise... in place! This means that you are not allowed to build a rotated matrix and return it. Modify the original matrix using a temporary variable to swap elements and return it. You are allowed to use a couple scalar variables if needed.\n\nSolutions similar to the following are correct, but not allowed for this kata:\n```python\ndef rotate_not_in_place(matrix):\n  return [[row[i] for row in reversed(matrix)] for i in range(len(matrix))]\n```\nEsentially any method that involves generating a new matrix isn't allowed.\n\nTo sum up, given a square matrix of any size as an input:\n```\n  [[1, 2, 3],\n  [4, 5, 6],\n  [7, 8, 9]]\n```\nModify the original matrix rotating it in place 90 degrees clockwise and return it:\n```\n  [[7, 4, 1],\n  [8, 5, 2],\n  [9, 6, 3]]\n```\n\nThis problem is very googleable so I suggest trying it out without looking for help.\n\n",
