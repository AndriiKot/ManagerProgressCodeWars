  "description": "You have been employed by the Japanese government to write a function that tests whether or not a building is strong enough to withstand a simulated earthquake. \n\nA building will fall if the magnitude of the earthquake is greater than the strength of the building. \n\nAn earthquake takes the form of a 2D-Array. Each element within the Outer-Array represents a shockwave, and each element within the Inner-Arrays represents a tremor. \nThe magnitude of the earthquake is determined by the product of the values of its shockwaves. A shockwave is equal to the sum of the values of its tremors. \n\nExample earthquake --> `[[5,3,7],[3,3,1],[4,1,2]] ((5+3+7) * (3+3+1) * (4+1+2)) = 735`\n\n\nA building begins with a strength value of 1000 when first built, but this value is subject to exponential decay of 1% per year. For more info on exponential decay, follow this link - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay\n\nGiven an earthquake and the age of a building, write a function that returns \"Safe!\" if the building is strong enough, or \"Needs Reinforcement!\" if it falls. \n\n",
