  "description": "You are back at your newly acquired decrypting job for the secret organization when a new assignment comes in. Apparently the enemy has been communicating using a device they call \"The Mirror\".  \nIt is a rudimentary device with encrypts the message by switching its letter with its mirror opposite (A => Z), (B => Y), (C => X) etc.  \n\nYour job is to build a method called \"mirror\" which will decrypt the messages. Resulting messages will be in lowercase.\n\nTo add more secrecy, you are to accept a second optional parameter, telling you which letters or characters are to be reversed; if it is not given, consider the whole alphabet as a default.\n\nTo make it a bit more clear: e.g. in case of \"abcdefgh\" as the second optional parameter, you replace \"a\" with \"h\", \"b\" with \"g\" etc. .\n\nFor example:\n```javascript\nmirror(\"Welcome home\"), \"dvoxlnv slnv\" //whole alphabet mirrored here\nmirror(\"hello\", \"abcdefgh\"), \"adllo\" //notice only \"h\" and \"e\" get reversed\n```\n```ruby\nmirror(\"Welcome home\"), \"dvoxlnv slnv\" #whole alphabet mirrored here\nmirror(\"hello\", \"abcdefgh\"), \"adllo\" #notice only \"h\" and \"e\" get reversed\n```\n```python\nmirror(\"Welcome home\"), \"dvoxlnv slnv\" #whole alphabet mirrored here\nmirror(\"hello\", \"abcdefgh\"), \"adllo\" #notice only \"h\" and \"e\" get reversed\n```",
