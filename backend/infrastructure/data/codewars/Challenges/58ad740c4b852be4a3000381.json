  "description": "You will be given an array and a single item from that array. The smallest value in array has the highest kyu - 1st kyu, 2nd smallest - 2nd kyu and so on. There are 8 kyus and each one has limited spots:\n\n```\n 1st kyu - 1 slot\n 2nd kyu - 2 slots\n 3rd kyu - 2 slots\n 4th kyu - 3 slots\n 5th kyu - 3 slots\n 6th kyu - 3 slots\n 7th kyu - 4 slots\n 8th kyu - 4 slots\n```\n\nYou should return kyu for the value passed based on the array. If value isn't low enough to get a kyu then return 0.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\n([66,12,90,15], 15) => 2\n([1,7,2,3,4,5], 1) => 1\n([1,7,2,3,4,5,9,10], 7) => 4\n```",
