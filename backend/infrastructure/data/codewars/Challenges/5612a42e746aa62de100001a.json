  "description": "The following formula is called the Decibel Scale:\n\n`$ \\beta = 10\\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{I}{10^{-12}}\\right) $`\n\nThe Decibel Scale is used to determine the loudness of a sound, measured in dB:\n\n* **β** is the result we want, defined in dB;\n* We multiply the result of the logarithmic operation by 10, otherwise it'll be called \"Bel Scale\";\n* We provide **I**, the **intensity** of the sound wave we need to find the loudness of, which is, for the purposes of this Kata, measured in 2D space and, hence, in **Watts per square meter**;\n* Finally, we divide the intensity by the **threshold of human hearing**, also measured in **Watts per square meter**. This is the softest possible sound a human ear can hear;\n* Since the threshold of human hearing involves an extremely small, long number, we need to utilize a logarithmic operation that will provide us the result in a convenient way.\n\nYour task is to simply calculate the loudness of a sound wave, given its intensity as a parameter to the **dBScale** function.\n\n*Results are automatically rounded to the **nearest integer** by the test cases.*\n",
