  "description": "A special type of prime is generated by the formula `p = 2^m * 3^n + 1` where `m` and `n` can be any non-negative integer.\n\nThe first `5` of these primes are `2, 3, 5, 7, 13`, and are generated as follows: \n```\n2 = 2^0 * 3^0 + 1\n3 = 2^1 * 3^0 + 1\n5 = 2^2 * 3^0 + 1\n7 = 2^1 * 3^1 + 1\n13 = 2^2 * 3^1 + 1\n..and so on\n```\nYou will be given a range and your task is to return the number of primes that have this property. For example, `solve(0,15) = 5`, because there are only `5` such primes `>= 0 and < 15`; they are `2,3,5,7,13`. The upper limit of the tests will not exceed `1,500,000`.\n\nMore examples in the test cases. \n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you like Prime Katas, you will enjoy this Kata: [Simple Prime Streaming](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a908da30025e995880000e3)",
