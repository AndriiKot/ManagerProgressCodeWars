  "description": "Let's build a calculator.\n\nThis is very basic Javascript kata.\n\nThe test expects you to provide a Calculator object with the following methods:\n\n```\nCalculator.add()\nCalculator.subtract()\nCalculator.multiply()\nCalculator.divide()\n```\n\nEach method expects two arguments, so for instance:\n\nCalculator.add(1,4) should return 5.\n\nOnly integers are expected to be passed in as arguments, and the `divide` method should return 'false' when trying the divide by zero.",
