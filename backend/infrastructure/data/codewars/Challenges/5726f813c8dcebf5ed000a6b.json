  "description": "A natural number is called **k-prime** if it has exactly `k` prime factors, counted with multiplicity. For example:\n```\nk = 2  -->  4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, ...\nk = 3  -->  8, 12, 18, 20, 27, 28, 30, ...\nk = 5  -->  32, 48, 72, 80, 108, 112, ...\n```\nA natural number is thus prime if and only if it is 1-prime.\n\n#### Task:\nComplete the function `count_Kprimes` (or `countKprimes`, `count-K-primes`, `kPrimes`) which is given parameters `k, start, end` (or `nd`) and returns an **array** (or a list or a string depending on the language - see \"Solution\" and \"Sample Tests\") of the `k-primes` between `start (inclusive)` and `end (inclusive)`.\n\n#### Example:\n```\ncountKprimes(5, 500, 600) --> [500, 520, 552, 567, 588, 592, 594]\n```\n\nNotes: \n- The first function would have been better named: `findKprimes` or `kPrimes` :-)\n- In C some helper functions are given (see declarations in 'Solution').\n- For Go: nil slice is expected when there are no k-primes between `start` and `end`.\n-----\n\n#### Second Task: puzzle (*not for Shell*)\nGiven a positive integer s, find the total number of solutions of the equation `a + b + c = s`, where a is 1-prime, b is 3-prime, and c is 7-prime.\n\nCall this function `puzzle(s)`.\n\n#### Examples:\n```\npuzzle(138)  -->  1  because [2 + 8 + 128] is the only solution\npuzzle(143)  -->  2  because [3 + 12 + 128] and [7 + 8 + 128] are the solutions\n```\n\n",
