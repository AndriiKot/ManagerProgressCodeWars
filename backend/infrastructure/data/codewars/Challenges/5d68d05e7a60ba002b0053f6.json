  "description": "John wants to give a total bonus of `$851` to his three employees taking *fairly as possible* into account their number of days of absence during the period under consideration.\nEmployee A was absent `18` days, B `15` days, and C `12` days.\n\n**The more absences, the lower the bonus** ... \n\nHow much should each employee receive?\nJohn thinks A should receive `$230`, B `$276`, C `$345` since `230 * 18 = 276 * 15 = 345 * 12` and `230 + 276 + 345 = 851`.\n\n#### Task:\nGiven an array `arr` (numbers of days of absence for each employee)  and a number `s` (total bonus) the function `bonus(arr, s)` will follow John's way and return an array of the *fair* bonuses of all employees in the same order as their numbers of days of absences.\n\n`s` and all elements of `arr` are positive integers.\n\n#### Examples:\n```\nbonus([18, 15, 12], 851) -> [230, 276, 345]\n\nbonus([30, 27, 8, 14, 7], 34067) -> [2772, 3080, 10395, 5940, 11880]\n```\n#### Notes\n- See Example Test Cases for more examples.\n- Please ask before translating.\n- In some tests the number of elements of `arr` can be big.\n",
