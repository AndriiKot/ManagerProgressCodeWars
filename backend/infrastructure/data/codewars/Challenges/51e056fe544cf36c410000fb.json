  "description": "Write a function that, given a string of text (possibly with punctuation and line-breaks),\nreturns an array of the top-3 most occurring words, in descending order of the number of occurrences.\n\nAssumptions:\n------------\n\n- A word is a string of letters (A to Z) optionally containing one or more apostrophes (`'`) in ASCII.\n- Apostrophes can appear at the start, middle or end of a word (`'abc`, `abc'`, `'abc'`, `ab'c` are all valid)\n- Any other characters (e.g. `#`, `\\`, `/` , `.` ...) are not part of a word and should be treated as whitespace.\n- Matches should be case-insensitive, and the words in the result should be lowercased.\n- Ties may be broken arbitrarily.\n- If a text contains fewer than three unique words, then either the top-2 or top-1 words should be returned, or an empty array if a text contains no words.\n\nExamples:\n------------\n\n```\n\"In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to\nmind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance\nin the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for\ncoursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most\nnights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra\non Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income.\"\n\n--> [\"a\", \"of\", \"on\"]\n\n\n\"e e e e DDD ddd DdD: ddd ddd aa aA Aa, bb cc cC e e e\"\n\n--> [\"e\", \"ddd\", \"aa\"]\n\n\n\"  //wont won't won't\"\n\n--> [\"won't\", \"wont\"]\n```\n\n\nBonus points (not really, but just for fun):\n------------\n\n1. Avoid creating an array whose memory footprint is roughly as big as the input text.\n2. Avoid sorting the entire array of unique words.",
