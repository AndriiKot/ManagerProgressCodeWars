  "description": "Each composed integer may have a prime factorization.\nIf n is the integer, it will be:\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/M5n0WCg\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/M5n0WCg.png?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nand k1, k2, k3....., kn are the exponents corresponding to each prime in the factorization.\n\nThe radical of n, Rad(n), will be the product of all the prime factors of the number, (without the exponents), so:\n\nRad(n) = p1 . p2 . p3  .....pn\n\nLet's see an example for a number, if n = 172800\n\nits prime factorization will be\n\n n = 2^8 . 3^3 . 5^2,\n\nRad(172800) = 2 . 3 . 5 = 30\n\nMany numbers, smaller than 172800, may have a radical considerably higher than 30, for example:\n\nRad(9305) = 5 . 1861 = 9305\n\nPrimes are a particular case, the value of its radical coincides with the value of the prime itself\n\nRad(31) = 31\n\nRad(57) = 57\n\nTo number 1 it's assigned, Rad(1) = 1\n\nLet's see the comparison between numbers and radicals for the first 10 numbers\n\n```python\n   n       Prime Descomposition    Prime Factors     Radical(n)\n   1                                                         1\n   2               2                       2                 2\n   3               3                       3                 3\n   4              2, 2                     2                 2\n   5               5                       5                 5\n   6              2, 3                    2, 3               6\n   7               7                       7                 7\n   8              2, 2, 2                  2                 2\n   9              3, 3                     3                 3   \n  10              2, 5                    2, 5               10\n```\n\nThe list above may be sorted by the value of the radicals and the order changes having another sequence. We add a new column that gives the ordinal number of different values\n\n```python\nk- Term        n       Radical(n)   \n1              1            1\n2              2            2\n3              4            2\n4              8            2\n5              3            3\n6              9            3\n7              5            5\n8              6            6\n9              7            7\n10            10            10\n```\n\nWe have some numbers that have the same value for its radical, the smaller numbers are selected to go first. For example, n = 2, 4, 8 have Radical(n) = 2, these numbers should be ordered by their own value.\n\nCreate a function hash_radSeq() that receives two arguments:\n\n- nMax is the upper bound such that all values of n are in the interval (1, nMax) (1 <=  n  <= nMax)\n\n- the number k, which is the ordinal number of a certain term in a sequence sorted by the values of the radicals\n\n- the function should ouput the value of n, for the corresponding ordinal number k (k-th), in a sequence sorted bby the values of Rad(n)\nLet's see some examples:\n```python\nhash_radSeq(10, 4) ------> 8\nhash_radSeq(10, 6) ------> 9\nhash_radSeq(10, 9) ------> 7\n```\n\nIf we increase of the number of nMax to 20, the sequence changes\n```python\nhash_radSeq(20, 4) ------> 8\nhash_radSeq(20, 6) ------> 3\nhash_radSeq(20, 9) ------> 6\n```\n\n(Your code will be tested for values of nMax up to 60000 and values of k up to 11000, so try to think in some data structure, useful for fast hashing)\n\n\nHappy coding!!\n\n\n\n",
