  "description": "# Task\nA staircase is given with a non-negative cost per each step. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. Create a solution to find the minimum sum of costs to reach the top. You can start at either of the first two steps.\n\n# Examples\n```\nStairs: [0, 2, 2, 1]\nStep 0: Start on first step\nStep 1: Pay 0 and climb two steps to reach the third step\nStep 2: Pay 2 and climb two steps to reach the top\nTotal spent: 2\n\nStairs: [0, 2, 3, 2]\nStep 0: Start on first step\nStep 1: Pay 0 and climb two steps to reach the third step\nStep 2: Pay 3 and climb two steps to reach the top\nTotal spent: 3\n\nStairs: [10, 15, 20]\nStep 0: Start on the second step\nStep 1: Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top\nTotal spent: 15\n\nStairs [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTake any path, because every step is free!\n\nStairs [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]\nStep 0: Start on the second step\nStep 1: Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach the fourth step\nStep 2: Pay 0 and climb one step to reach the fifth step\nStep 3: Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach the top\nTotal spent: 2\n```\n# Notes\n- 2 <= number of steps <= 1000",
