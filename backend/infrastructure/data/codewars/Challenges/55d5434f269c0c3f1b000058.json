  "description": "Write a function which takes two integers `num1` and `num2` and returns `1` if there is a straight triple of a digit at any place in `num1` and also a straight double of the **same** digit in `num2`.\n\nIf this isn't the case, return `0`.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\n451999277, 41177722899 -->  1 // num1 has straight triple 999s and num2 has straight double 99s\n1222345, 12345 -->  0 // num1 has straight triple 2s but num2 has only a single 2\n12345, 12345 -->  0\n888, 77 --> 0 // num1 has three '8's, num2 has 2 '7's, but they are not the same digit\n88888, 88888   --> 1 // more than 3 or 2 repetitions also count \n123123123, 123 --> 0 // '123' is not a single digit\n```",
