  "description": "You have to create a function named`one_two` (`oneTwo` for Java or `Preloaded.OneTwo` for C#) that returns 1 or 2 with equal probabilities. `one_two` is already defined in a global scope and can be called everywhere.\n\nYour goal is to create a function named `one_two_three` (`oneTwoThree` for Java or `OneTwoThree` for C#) that returns 1, 2 or 3 with equal probabilities using only the `one_two` function.\n\nDo not try to cheat returning repeating non-random sequences. There is a randomness test especially for this case.",
