  "description": "A variation of determining leap years, assuming only integers are used and years can be negative and positive.\n\nWrite a function which will return the days in the year and the year entered in a string.  For example:\n\n```\nInput: year = 2000 ==> returns \"2000 has 366 days\"\n```\n\nThere are a few assumptions we will accept the year 0, even though there is no year 0 in the Gregorian Calendar.\n\nAlso the basic rule for validating a leap year are as follows\n\nMost years that can be divided evenly by 4 are leap years. \n\nException: Century years are NOT leap years UNLESS they can be evenly divided by 400.\n\nSo the years 0, -64 and 2016 will return 366 days.\nWhilst 1974, -10 and 666 will return 365 days.\n",
