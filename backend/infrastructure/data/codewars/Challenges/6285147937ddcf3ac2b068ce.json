  "description": "### Introduction \n\nAn IPv4 subnet mask consist of 32 bits, divided into four octets.\nAs an example, a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 can be written as:\n\n```\n    11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000\n      255   .  255   .  255   .   0    \n```\n\nThe ones (1) represent the network/subnet part of the mask\nand the zeroes (0) represent the **host** part of the mask.\n\nThe zeroes tell us how many IP addresses there are in the \nnetwork defined by the ones.\n\nIn the example subnet above there are 256 addresses available;\nmore precisely 0-255.\n\n### The Assignment\n\nYour task is to implement a function `uint32_t hosts_in_subnet(const char* netmask)` which takes in an IPv4 subnet mask `netmask` and returns a 32-bit unsigned integer `uint32_t` with the number of **valid** host addresses. Using the subnet mask `netmask` you can figure out how many **usable** host addresses there are in a network defined by that netmask.\n\n### Notes\n\n1. The first and last address in a subnet are **not** valid\nhost addresses; they are reserved for the *network* \nand *broadcast* addresses. \n\n2. There are two special cases: \n * If all 32 bits are ones there is only **one** valid\n   host address.\n * When the mask has 31 bits set to ones there are **two** \n   valid host addresses (according to RFC 3021).\n\n### Testing\n\nThe tests will challenge you with valid netmasks in the range (`128.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255`) and ***nothing else***.",
