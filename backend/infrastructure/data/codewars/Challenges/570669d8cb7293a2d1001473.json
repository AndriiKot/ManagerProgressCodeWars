As a result Chuck very rarely has to use the word false.\n\nIt is a less well known fact that if something is true, and Chuck doesn't want it to be, Chuck can scare the truth with his massive biceps, and it automatically becomes false. \n\nYour task is to be more like Chuck (ha! good luck!). You must return false without ever actually using the word false...\n\nGo show some truth who's boss!",
