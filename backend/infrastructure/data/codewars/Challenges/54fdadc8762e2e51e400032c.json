  "description": "JavaScript provides a built-in parseInt method.\n\nIt can be used like this:\n\n- `\"10\"` returns `10`\n- `\"10 apples\"` also returns `10`\n\nWe would like it to return `\"NaN\"` (as a string) for the second case because the input string is not a valid number.\n\nYou are asked to write a function with the following rules:\n\n- It should make the conversion if the given string only contains a single integer value (and possibly spaces - including tabs, line feeds... - at both ends)\n- For all other strings (including the ones representing float values), it should return NaN\n- It should assume that all numbers are not signed and written in base 10\n",
