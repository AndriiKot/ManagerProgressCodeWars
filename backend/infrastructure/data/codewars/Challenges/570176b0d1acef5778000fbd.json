  "description": "A chain of car rental locals made a statistical research for each local in a city. They measure the average of clients for every day.\n\nThey used the Simpson model for probabilities:\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/LQWj8kM\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/LQWj8kM.png?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nThe number ```e``` is ```2,7182818284....```\n\nSuposse that one of the locals has an average 8 clients per day.\n\nThe probability of having 12 clients, one of the goals of the manager, will be:\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/L7bNl2r\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/L7bNl2r.png?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nIt is a very low value, almost 5%. It shows that they have to work a lot for this increment.\n\nAnd, how would it be if we want to know the sum of probabilities for values below ```12``` (cumulative probability)?\n```\nP(c < 12) = P(c=0) + P(c=1) + P(c=3) + P(c=4) + P(c=5) + P(c=6) + P(c=7) + P(c=8) + P(c=9) +  P(c=10) + P(c=11) \n\nP(c<12) = 0.00033546262790251196 + 0.0026837010232200957 + 0.010734804092880383 + 0.02862614424768102 + 0.05725228849536204 + 0.09160366159257927 + 0.12213821545677235 + 0.13958653195059698 + 0.13958653195059698 + 0.12407691728941954 + 0.09926153383153563 + 0.072190206422935 = 0.888075998981\n```\nBut the probability of having  below or equal the value ```12```, will be:\n```\nP(c≤12) = P(c=0) + P(c=1) + P(c=3) + P(c=4) + P(c=5) + P(c=6) + P(c=7) + P(c=8) + P(c=9) +  P(c=10) + P(c=11) + P(c=12) = 0.936202803263\n(P(c≤12) = P(12≥c))\n```\nThe probability for having equal or more clients than 12 will be:\n```\nP(c>12) = P(c=13) + P(c=14) + P(c=15) + ........+ P(c=+∞) \n(P(c>12) = P(12<c))\n```\nBut the sum of the probabilities for c = 0 to +∞ is ```1```\n\nSo,\n```\nP(c>12) = 1 - P(c≤12) = 1 - 0.936202803263 = 0.063797196737\n```\n\nMake the function ```prob_simpson()```, that will receive 2 or 3 arguments.\n\n1) Two arguments if we want to calculate the probability for a specific number, receives the average ```lamb``` and the variable ```x```.\n\n2) Three arguments if we want the cumulative probability for a value, besides receiving ```lamb``` and ```x```, will receive one of the following operators in string format: ```<, <=, >, >=```.\n\nLet's see some cases for probability at the number:\n```python\nprob_simpson(8, 12) == 0.04812680428195667\nprob_simpson(8, 11) == 0.072190206422935\nprob_simpson(8, 10) == 0.09926153383153563\n```\nAnd for cumulative probability:\n```python\nprob_simpson(8, 12, '>') == 0.888075998981    # or P(12>c)\nprob_simpson(8, 12, '>=') ==  0.936202803263  # or P(12≥c)\nprob_simpson(8, 12, '<') == 0.063797196737    # or P(12<c)\nprob_simpson(8, 12, '<=') == 0.111924001019   # or P(12≤c)\n```\nYou may assume that you will not receive high values for ```lamb``` and ```x```\nThis kata will also have translations into Javascript and Ruby.\n\nEnjoy it!",
