  "description": "### Happy Holidays fellow Code Warriors!\nYou got here right on time Code Warrior! The Grinch has initiated an attack on the North Pole! We need to take out his Missiles before they hit the workshop and destroy all the gifts! Santa's missile tracker Elves have determined how far away each missile is from our position, and the speed at which they are traveling.\n\n### Stop the Grinch's Attack!\nWrite a function called `prioritizeMissiles` that accepts an array of Missile objects, and returns an array containing the names of the Missile objects sorted by the amount of time left before the missile hits Santa's workshop. If multiple missiles are going to hit the workshop at the same time, maintain the same order they appear in in the passed in array.\n\n Missiles that will hit the workshop sooner should be closer to the front of the list, while missiles that will hit later should be closer to the end of the list. Santa's anti missile defense system will use your solution to eliminate the missiles.\n\n### Examples:\n```javascript\nprioritizeMissiles([\n  {name: 'DASHER_V3', distance: 1000, speed: 100},\n  {name: 'DANCER_V2.3', distance: 1000, speed:10},\n  {name: 'PRANCER_V1.2', distance: 1000, speed: 1} \n]); // => returns ['DASHER_V3', 'DANCER_V2.3', 'PRANCER_V1.2']\n\nprioritizeMissiles([\n  {name: 'VIXEN_V1.1', distance: 500, speed: 4},\n  {name: 'COMET_V4', distance: 1000, speed: 500},\n  {name: 'CUPID_V5', distance: 100, speed: 1} \n]); // => returns ['COMET_V4', 'CUPID_V5', 'VIXEN_V1.1']\n```\n\nHint: The time before a missile hits Santa's workshop can be calculated using the distance and speed of that missile.",
