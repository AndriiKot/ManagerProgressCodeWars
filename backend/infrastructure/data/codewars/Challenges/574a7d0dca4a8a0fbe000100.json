  "description": "In genetic the reverse complement of a sequence is formed by **reversing** the sequence and then taking the complement of each symbol.\n\nThe four nucleotides in DNA is Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Thymine (Thymine). \n\n- A is the complement of T \n- C is the complement of G.\n\nThis is a bi-directional relation so:\n\n- T is the complement of A\n- G is the complement of C.\n\nFor this kata you need to complete the reverse complement function that take a DNA string and return the reverse complement string.\n\n**Note**: You need to take care of lower and upper case. And if a sequence conatains some invalid characters you need to return \"Invalid sequence\".\n\nThis kata is based on the following [one](http://www.codewars.com/kata/complementary-dna/ruby) but with a little step in addition. \n",
