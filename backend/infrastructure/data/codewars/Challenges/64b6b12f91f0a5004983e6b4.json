  "description": "In this Kata, you will be implementing a function that reverses the elements of an array. The function should take an array as input and return a new array with the elements in reverse order. You are not allowed to use any built-in Python functions such as `reverse()` and `[]` or slicing `[::-1]` to accomplish this. Instead, you should implement your own algorithm to reverse the array.\n\nInput:\n\nThe function takes a single parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of the array can be up to 10^5.\n\nOutput:\n\nThe function should return a new list containing the elements of the input array in reverse order.\n\n*Example:*\n\n#### arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n#### result = reverse_array(arr)\n#### print(result)  #Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n\nNote:\n\n- The input array should not be modified.\n\n- You are not allowed to use any built-in Python functions or libraries that directly reverse the array.\n\n- You can assume that the input array will always contain integers.\n\n- You should optimize your solution for efficiency, as the input array can be quite large.",
