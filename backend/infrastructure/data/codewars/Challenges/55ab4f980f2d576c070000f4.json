  "description": "With a friend we used to play the following game on a chessboard\n(8, rows, 8 columns).\nOn the first row at the *bottom* we put numbers:\n\n`1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8, 8/9`\n\nOn row 2 (2nd row from the bottom) we have:\n\n`1/3, 2/4, 3/5, 4/6, 5/7, 6/8, 7/9, 8/10`\n\nOn row 3:\n\n`1/4, 2/5, 3/6, 4/7, 5/8, 6/9, 7/10, 8/11`\n\nuntil last row:\n\n`1/9, 2/10, 3/11, 4/12, 5/13, 6/14, 7/15, 8/16`\n\n\nWhen all numbers are on the chessboard each in turn we toss a coin. The one who get \"head\" wins and\nthe other gives him, in dollars, the **sum of the numbers on the chessboard**.\nWe play for fun, the dollars come from a monopoly game! \n\n#### Task\nHow much can I (or my friend) win or loses for each game if the chessboard has n rows and n columns? Add all of the fractional values on an n by n sized board and give the answer as a simplified fraction.\n\n#### See Sample Tests for each language\n  \n- *Ruby, Python, JS, Coffee, Clojure, PHP, Elixir, Crystal, Typescript, Go:*\n\nThe function called 'game' with parameter n (integer >= 0) returns as result an irreducible fraction written as an array of integers: [numerator, denominator].\nIf the denominator is 1 return [numerator].\n\n- *Haskell, Elm:*\n\n'game' returns either a \"Left Integer\" if denominator is 1 otherwise \n\"Right (Integer, Integer)\" \n\n- *Prolog, COBOL:*\n\n'game' returns an irreducible fraction written as an array of integers: [numerator, denominator].\nIf the denominator is 1 return [numerator, 1].\n\n- *Java, C#, C++, F#, Swift, Reason, Kotlin, Pascal, Perl:*\n\n'game' returns a string that mimicks the array returned in Ruby, Python, JS, etc...\n\n- *Fortran, Bash: 'game' returns a string*\n\n\n- *Forth:*\n\nreturn on the stack the numerator and the denominator (even if the denominator is 1)\n\n\n- In Fortran - as in any other language - the returned string is not permitted to contain any redundant trailing whitespace: you can use dynamically allocated character strings.\n\n\n",
