  "description": "Given a `Date` (in JS and Ruby) or `hours` and `minutes` (in C and Python), return the angle between the two hands of a 12-hour analog clock in **radians**.\n\n\n### Notes:\n\n* The minute hand always points to the exact minute (there is no seconds hand).\n* The hour hand does not \"snap\" to the tick marks: e.g. at `6:30` the angle is not `0` because the hour hand is already half way between `6` and `7`.\n* Return the smaller of the angles ( <= π ).\n* Return `π` if the hands are opposite.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n* at noon the angle is: `0`\n* at `3:00` the angle is: `π/2` (90 degrees)\n* at `6:00` the angle is: `π` (180 degrees)\n* at `9:00` the angle is: `π/2` (90 degrees)\n",
