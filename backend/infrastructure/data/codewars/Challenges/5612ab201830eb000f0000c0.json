  "description": "The number `12` is the first number in having six divisors, they are: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.`\nYour challenge for this kata is to find the minimum number that has a certain number of divisors.\nFor this purpose we have to create the function \n\n`find_min_num() or findMinNum() or similar in the other languages`\n\nthat receives the wanted number of divisors `num_div`, and outputs the smallest number having an amount of divisors equals to `num_div`.\n\nLet's see some cases:\n```\nfind_min_num(10) = 48 # divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24 and  48\nfind_min_num(12) = 60\n```\nIn this kata all the tests will be with `numDiv < 80`\n\n(There will be a next kata with numDiv < 10000, Find the First Number Having a Certain Number of Divisors II, should have the help of number theory)\n\nEnjoy it and happy coding!\n(Memoization is advisable)",
