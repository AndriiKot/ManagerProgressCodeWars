  "description": "We want to create a function, which returns an array of functions, which return their index in the array. For better understanding, here an example:\n\n```javascript\nvar callbacks = createFunctions(5); // create an array, containing 5 functions\n\ncallbacks[0](); // must return 0\ncallbacks[3](); // must return 3\n```\n\nWe already implemented that function, but when we actually run the code, the result doesn't look like what we expected. Can you spot, what's wrong with it? A test fixture is also available",
