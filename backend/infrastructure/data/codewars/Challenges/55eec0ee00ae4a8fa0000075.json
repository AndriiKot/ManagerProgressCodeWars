  "description": "The prime `149` has 3 permutations which are also primes: `419`, `491` and `941`.\n\nThere are 3 primes below `1000` with three prime permutations:\n```\n149 ==> 419 ==> 491 ==> 941\n179 ==> 197 ==> 719 ==> 971\n379 ==> 397 ==> 739 ==> 937\n```\n\nBut there are 9 primes below `1000` with two prime permutations:\n```\n113 ==> 131 ==> 311\n137 ==> 173 ==> 317\n157 ==> 571 ==> 751\n163 ==> 613 ==> 631\n167 ==> 617 ==> 761\n199 ==> 919 ==> 991\n337 ==> 373 ==> 733\n359 ==> 593 ==> 953\n389 ==> 839 ==> 983\n```\n\nFinally, we can find 34 primes below `1000` with only one prime permutation: \n```\n[13, 17, 37, 79, 107, 127, 139, 181, 191, 239, 241, 251, 277, 281, 283, 313, 347, 349, 367, 457, 461, 463, 467, 479, 563, 569, 577, 587, 619, 683, 709, 769, 787, 797]\n```\n\nEach set of permuted primes are represented by its smallest value, for example the set `149, 419, 491, 941` is represented by `149`, and the set has 3 permutations.\n\n**Notes**\n* the original number (`149` in the above example) is **not** counted as a permutation;\n* permutations with leading zeros are **not valid**\n\n\n## Your Task\n\nYour task is to create a function that takes two arguments:\n* an upper limit (`n_max`) and\n* the number of prime permutations (`k_perms`) that the primes should generate **below or equal to** `n_max`\n\nThe function should return the following three values as a list:\n* the number of permutational primes below or equal to the given limit,\n* the smallest prime such prime,\n* and the largest such prime\n\nIf no eligible primes were found below the limit, the output should be `[0, 0, 0]`\n\n~~~if:haskell\n* For Haskell, the output type is `Maybe (Int,Int,Int)`. If no eligible primes are found, the output should be `Nothing`.\n~~~\n\n## Examples\n\nLet's see how it would be with the previous cases:\n```python\npermutational_primes(1000, 3) ==> [3, 149, 379]\n''' 3 primes with 3 permutations below 1000, smallest: 149, largest: 379 '''\n\npermutational_primes(1000, 2) ==> [9, 113, 389]\n''' 9 primes with 2 permutations below 1000, smallest: 113, largest: 389 '''\n\npermutational_primes(1000, 1) ==> [34, 13, 797]\n''' 34 primes with 1 permutation below 1000, smallest: 13, largest: 797 '''\n```\n\n```javascript\npermutational_primes(1000, 3)  ==> [3, 149, 379]\n// 3 primes with 3 permutations below 1000, smallest: 149, largest: 379\n\npermutational_primes(1000, 2)  ==> [9, 113, 389]\n// 9 primes with 2 permutations below 1000, smallest: 113, largest: 389\n\npermutational_primes(1000, 1)  ==> [34, 13, 797]\n// 34 primes with 1 permutation below 1000, smallest: 13, largest: 797\n```\n\n```haskell\n>>> permutationalPrimes 1000 3\nJust (3,149,379)  -- 3 primes with 3 permutations below 1000, smallest: 149, largest: 379\n>>> permutationalPrimes 1000 2\nJust (9,113,389)  -- 9 primes with 2 permutations below 1000, smallest: 113, largest: 389\n>>> permutationalPrimes 1000 1\nJust (34,13,797)  -- 34 primes with 1 permutation below 1000, smallest: 13, largest: 797\n```\n\nHappy coding!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
