  "description": "*Note: to get straight to the kata you may skip the first two paragraphs*\n\n## Introduction - JoJo's World\n\nYou may have heard about one of the most popular and influencial Japanese franchises, hailing from the 80s and still running with very good sale figures: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo's_Bizarre_Adventure\" target=\"_blank\">JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken</a> AKA JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.\n\nAnd if the notion of \"bizarre\" somehow eludes you, you could think of something like facing a basically immortal ancient superhuman being, worshipped and feared by both Aztecs and Romans who just got upgraded to demigod status and his showing off his new powers against you and your allies, which happen to include the largest American foundation, a nazi supercyborg and his loyal elite troopers.\n\n\n## Instructions\n\nBut I digress: point is that to date the author creates 8 sagas around 8 different JoJos: the one you could recognize in the video is <b>Jo</b>seph <b>Jo</b>estar, grand-son of the fist JoJo, <b>Jo</b>nathan <b>Jo</b>estar.\n\nAnd you could see a pattern already here: you are a JoJo if both your name and surname start with \"Jo-\". One more complication comes with the third JoJo: Jotaro Kujo (or, following Japanese use of putting the family name first: Ku<b>Jo</b> <b>Jo</b>taro). One last variant comes with the fifth JoJo: as it is of Italian descent (well, sorta of) and the traditional Italian alphabet has only 21 letters (lacking J, K, W, Y and X), the name that you would pronounce <b>Jo</b>rno <b>Jo</b>vanna has to be spelled \"Giorno Giovanna\".\n\nNow, the drill in this kata is rather easy: either create a regex expression or a function to find if a given name is a proper JoJo or not in boolean terms (true/True if it is valid, false/False otherwise).\n\nTo recap, you have a valid JoJo if:\n\n- both your firstname and your surname start with \"Jo-\"\n- your firstname starts with \"Jo-\" and your surname ends with \"-Jo\"\n- both your firstname and your surname start with \"Gio-\"\n\nNotes:\n- don't expect the to have a string formed by only two words joined by a space: strings may be of 1 word, 2 words, 3 words or more\n- lower- and uppercase will not matter here\n- consider the first word as the firstname and the last word as the surname\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\n\"Joseph Joestar\"    --> valid JoJo name\n\"Dio Brando\"        --> invalid JoJo name\n\"George Joestar II\" --> invalid JoJo name (still cool, though)\n\"Giorno Giovanna\"   --> valid JoJo name\n\"Josuke Joestar\"    --> valid JoJo name (not his actual surname, but ok)\n\"Kars\"              --> invalid JoJo name\n\"Caesar Zeppeli\"    --> invalid JoJo name\n```\n\n\n## Final Notes\n\nThis kata is designed to give regex beginners a chance, so in your solutions try to be as **creative, elegant, extravagant** and **glamorous** as possible, in full homage of Hiroiko Araki, JoJo's creator and sole mangaka to work with institutions like the Louvre Museum of the famous luxury brand Gucci, not to mention <a href=\"http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_cultural_influences_of_JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure\" target=\"_blank\">how influential it has been on the Japanese pop culture</a> (the video above alone containes inspirations fort least 4 major beatem ups characters, including Guile of SFII fame).\n\n*All the characters named in this kata are copyright of their rightful owners and are mentioned only for educational purposes, a fair use according to the Berne convention.
