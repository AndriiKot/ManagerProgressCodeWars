  "description": "In this kata, you will be given a string containing numbers from **a** to **b**, one number can be missing from these numbers, then the string will be shuffled, you're expected to return an array of all possible missing numbers.\n\n## Examples (input => output)\n\nHere's a string with numbers from 1 - 21, its missing one number and the string is then shuffled, your'e expected to return a list of possible missing numbers.\n\n\n```\n1, 21, \"2198765123416171890101112131415\"  => [ 12, 21 ]\n```\n\nYou won't be able to tell if its `21` or `12`, you must return all possible values in an array.\n\n## Another Example\n\n```\n5, 10, \"578910\" => [ 6 ]\n```\n\n#### Documentation:\n\nThe parameters will be in order two numbers and a string:\n\n- start  **=>** from\n- stop   **=>**  to\n- string **=>**  numbers from **start** to **stop** in string form (shuffled), but missing one number\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n- if there're no missing numbers return an empty list\n\n\nToo easy ?
