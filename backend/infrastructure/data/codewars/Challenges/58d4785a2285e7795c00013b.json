  "description": "The goal is to write a pair of functions the first of which will take a string of binary along with a specification of bits, which will return a numeric, signed complement in two's complement format. The second will do the reverse. It will take in an integer along with a number of bits, and return a binary string. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement\n\nThus, to_twos_complement should take the parameters binary = \"0000 0001\", bits = 8 should return 1. And, binary = \"11111111\", bits = 8 should return -1 . While, from_twos_complement should return \"00000000\" from the parameters n = 0, bits = 8 . And, \"11111111\" from n = -1, bits = 8. \n\nYou should account for some edge cases.  ",
