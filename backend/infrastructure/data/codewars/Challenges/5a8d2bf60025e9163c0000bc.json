  "description": "In this kata, you will sort elements in an array by decreasing frequency of elements. If two elements have the same frequency, sort them by increasing value. \n\n```haskell\nsolve([2,3,5,3,7,9,5,3,7]) = [3,3,3,5,5,7,7,2,9]\n-- We sort by highest frequency to lowest frequency.\n-- If two elements have same frequency, we sort by increasing value.\n```\n```cpp\nsolve({2,3,5,3,7,9,5,3,7}) == {3,3,3,5,5,7,7,2,9}\n// We sort by highest frequency to lowest frequency.\n// If two elements have same frequency, we sort by increasing value.\n```\n```java\nSolution.sortByFrequency(new int[]{2, 3, 5, 3, 7, 9, 5, 3, 7});\n// Returns {3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 2, 9}\n// We sort by highest frequency to lowest frequency.\n// If two elements have same frequency, we sort by increasing value.\n```\n\nMore examples in test cases.\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n### Encodings\n\npurity: `LetRec`  \nnumEncoding: `BinaryScott`  \nexport constructors `nil, cons` and deconstructor `foldl` for your `List` encoding  \n~~~\n\nGood luck!\n\nPlease also try [Simple time difference](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b76a34ff71e5de9db0000f2)",
