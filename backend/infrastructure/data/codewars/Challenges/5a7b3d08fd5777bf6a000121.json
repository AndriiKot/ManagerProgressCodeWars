  "description": "In this kata the function returns an array/list like the one passed to it but with its nth element removed (with `0 <= n <= array/list.length - 1`). The function is already written for you and the basic tests pass, but random tests fail. Your task is to figure out why and fix it.\n\nGood luck!\n\n~~~if:javascript\nSome good reading: [MDN Docs about arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)\n~~~\n~~~if:python\nSome good reading: [Python Docs about lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)\n~~~\n~~~if:coffeescript\nSome good reading: [CoffeeScript docs](http://coffeescript.org/)\n~~~\n\n",
