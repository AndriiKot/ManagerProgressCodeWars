  "description": "A [happy number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number) is one where if you repeatedly square its digits and add them together, you eventually end up at 1.\n\nFor example: \n\n```7 -> 49 -> 97 -> 130 -> 10 -> 1``` so ```7``` is a happy number.\n\n```42 -> 20 -> 4 -> 16 -> 37 -> 58 -> 89 -> 145 -> 42``` so ```42``` is **not** a happy number.\n\nThis can also be done with powers other than 2.\n\n\nComplete the function that receives 2 arguments: the starting number and the exponent. It should return an array of numbers containing whatever loop it encounters, or ```[1]``` if it doesn't encounter any. This array should only include the numbers in the loop, not any that lead into the loop, and should repeat the first number as the last number e.g.:\n```\n[42, 20, 4, 16, 37, 58, 89, 145, 42]\n```\n\nThe first number in the array should be where the loop is first encountered.\n\nAll function inputs will be positive integers, with the exponent being between 2 and 4.",
