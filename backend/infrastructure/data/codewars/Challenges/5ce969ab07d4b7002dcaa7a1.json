  "description": "In this Kata, you will be given a string and your task will be to return the length of the longest prefix that is also a suffix. A prefix is the start of a string while the suffix is the end of a string.  For instance, the prefixes of the string `\"abcd\"` are `[\"a\",\"ab\",\"abc\"]`. The suffixes are `[\"bcd\", \"cd\", \"d\"]`. You should not overlap the prefix and suffix.\n\n```Haskell\nfor example:\nsolve(\"abcd\") = 0, because no prefix == suffix. \nsolve(\"abcda\") = 1, because the longest prefix which == suffix is \"a\".\nsolve(\"abcdabc\") = 3. Longest prefix which == suffix is \"abc\".\nsolve(\"aaaa\") = 2. Longest prefix which == suffix is \"aa\". You should not overlap the prefix and suffix\nsolve(\"aa\") = 1. You should not overlap the prefix and suffix.\nsolve(\"a\") = 0. You should not overlap the prefix and suffix.\n```\n\nAll strings will be lowercase and string lengths are `1 <= length <= 500`\n\nMore examples in test cases. Good luck!",
