  "description": "The `Guesser` class is set up to generate a random number from 1-1000, and allows 10 guesses to get the number.\n\nYour task is to write a method '`get_number`' (`Guesser.prototype.getNumber()` in javascript) inside the `Guesser` class (or its derived class in Java) to identify a random number from 1-1000.\n\nYou should use the method:\n```ruby\nguess number\n```\n```javascript\nthis.guess(number)\n```\n```java\nguess(number)\n```\nWhich will return either:\n```\n\"Too high!\" If the guess is too high.\n\"Too low!\" If the guess is too low.\nor \"Correct!\" If the guess is correct.\n```\n\nYou can only call this method 10 times before an exception is raised.\n",
