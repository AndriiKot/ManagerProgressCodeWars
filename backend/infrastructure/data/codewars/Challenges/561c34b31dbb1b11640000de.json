  "description": "Many primes can be decomposed as a sum of two perfect squares.\nFor example:\n```python\n5 = 4 + 1 = 2² + 1²\n29 = 4 + 25 = 2² + 5²\n```\nBut we have some primes that does not have this property like 3, 7, 11.\n\nYour task is to give the i-th prime in an ordered and increasing sequence of these non partitionable primes in perfect squares..\n\nWe give the name of the function with some cases bellow:\n```python\nith_nondecomp_prime(3) == 11\n\nith_nondecomp_prime(10) == 67\n```\nYour code should give fast answers for primes bellow 1000000. \nHappy coding!!\n\n(Memoization is advisable for being able to pass many tests (more than 500) with very high values)\n(Hint: Study primes of the form 4n + 3)\n",
