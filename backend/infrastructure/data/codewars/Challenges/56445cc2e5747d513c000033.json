  "description": "In Russia, there is an army-purposed station named [UVB-76](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UVB-76) or \"Buzzer\". \n\nMost of time specific \"buzz\" noise is being broadcasted, but on very rare occasions, the buzzer signal is interrupted and a voice transmission in Russian takes place.\n\nTransmitted messages have always the same format like this:\n\n```\nMDZHB 01 213 SKIF 38 87 23 95\n```\nor \n```\nMDZHB 80 516 GANOMATIT 21 23 86 25\n```\n\nMessage format consists of following parts:\n  * Initial keyword \"MDZHB\";\n  * Two groups of digits, 2 digits in first and 3 in second ones;\n  * Some keyword of arbitrary length consisting only of uppercase letters;\n  * Final 4 groups of digits with 2 digits in each group.\n  \nYour task is to write a function that can validate the correct UVB-76 message. Function should return `true` if message is in correct format and `false` otherwise.  ",
