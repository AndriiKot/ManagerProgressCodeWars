  "description": "The purpose of this kata is to write a higher-order function returning a new function that iterates on a specified function a given number of times. This new function takes in an argument as a seed to start the computation from.\n\n```if-not:haskell\nFor instance, consider the function `getDouble`.\nWhen run twice on value `3`, yields `12` as shown below.\n\n    getDouble(3) => 6\n    getDouble(6) => 12\n\nLet us name the new function `createIterator` and we should be able to obtain the same result using `createIterator` as shown below:\n\n    var doubleIterator = createIterator(getDouble, 2); // This means, it runs *getDouble* twice\n    doubleIterator(3) => 12\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, all function inputs to `createIterator` would be functions returning a small number and number of iterations would always be integers.\n```\n\n```if:haskell\nFor instance, consider `double = (* 2)`.\nWhen run twice on value `3`, it yields `12`:\n\n    (double . double) 3 -> 12\n\nUsing `iterateN :: Int -> (a -> a) -> (a -> a)` we should be able to obtain the same result:\n\n    doubleTwice = iterateN 2 double -- This means, it runs `double` twice\n    doubleTwice 3 -> 12\n\nNote that `iterateN` is related to `Prelude.iterate` and e.g. `Data.Sequence.iterateN`; however, it only returns one value instead of a list of them.\n```",
