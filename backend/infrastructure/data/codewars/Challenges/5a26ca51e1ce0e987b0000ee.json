  "description": "Similar setting of the [previous](https://www.codewars.com/kata/progressive-spiral-number-position/), this time you are called to identify in which \"branch\" of the spiral a given number will end up.\n\nConsidering a square of numbers disposed as the 25 items in [the previous kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/progressive-spiral-number-position/), the branch are numbered as it follows:\n\n```\n17 16 15 14 13    1 1 1 1 0\n18 05 04 03 12    2 1 1 0 0\n19 06 01 02 11 => 2 2 0 0 0\n20 07 08 09 10    2 2 3 3 0\n21 22 23 24 25    2 3 3 3 3\n```\n\nMeaning that, for example, numbers in the `10-13` range will be in branch `0`, numbers in the range `14-17` are inside branch `1`, all those nice numbers in the `18-21` can call branch `2` their house and finally the `21-25` team all falls under the `3` branch.\n\nYour function must return the number of the index of each number [`1` being a special case you might consider equivalent to being in the first branch, `0`], as per examples:\n\n```javascript\nbranch(1) === 0 //kind of special case here\nbranch(5) === 1\nbranch(25) === 3\nbranch(30) === 0\nbranch(50) === 0\n```\n```python\nbranch(1) == 0 #kind of special case here\nbranch(5) == 1\nbranch(25) == 3\nbranch(30) == 0\nbranch(50) == 0\n```\n```ruby\nbranch(1) == 0 #kind of special case here\nbranch(5) == 1\nbranch(25) == 3\nbranch(30) == 0\nbranch(50) == 0\n```\n```crystal\nbranch(1) == 0 #kind of special case here\nbranch(5) == 1\nbranch(25) == 3\nbranch(30) == 0\nbranch(50) == 0\n```\n```cpp\nbranch(1) == 0 //kind of special case here\nbranch(5) == 1\nbranch(25) == 3\nbranch(30) == 0\nbranch(50) == 0\n```\n\nIt might help A LOT to both solve the [previous kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/progressive-spiral-number-position/) and to visualize the diagonals of the square. Be ready for big numbers and, as usual, inspired by [AoC](http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/3). Finally, when ready, go to compute [the distance](https://www.codewars.com/kata/progressive-spiral-number-distance/) of the series.",
