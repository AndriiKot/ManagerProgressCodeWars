  "description": "Develop an SQL query that retrieves a sorted list of opinion changes among individuals, with special emphasis on handling NULL values\n\nWe have `people` table:\n\n* `person_id` (int, primary key): Unique identifier for each person.\n* `name` (string): The name of the person.\n\nand `people_opinions`\n\n* `opinion_giver_id` (int, foreign key referencing `people.person_id`): Identifier for the person giving the opinion.\n* `person_id` (int, foreign key referencing `people.person_id`): Identifier for the person being opined about.\n* `current_opinion` (string, nullable): The current opinion of the opinion giver about the person. Nullable to represent the absence of an opinion.\n* `previous_opinion` (string, nullable): The previous opinion of the opinion giver about the person. Nullable to represent the absence of an opinion.\n\nWrite an SQL query that selects the names of the opinion giver and receiver(`opinion_giver` and `opinion_receiver`), along with their current (`current_opinion`) and previous (`previous_opinion`) opinions.\nInclude only records where the current opinion differs from the previous opinion.\nSort the results first by the name of the opinion giver and then by the name of the opinion receiver - both in ascending alphabetical order.\n\n#### Desired Output\n\nThe desired output should look like this:\n\n<table><!----><tr><th>opinion_giver</th><th>opinion_receiver</th><th>current_opinion</th><th>previous_opinion</th></tr><tr><td>Albert Einstein</td><td>Robert Oppenheimer</td><td>Innovator</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Richard Feynman</td><td>Linus Pauling</td><td>Pseudoscientific</td><td>Brilliant</td></tr><tr><td>Richard Feynman</td><td>Richard Feynman</td><td></td><td>Admirable</td></tr><tr><td>Robert Oppenheimer</td><td>Albert Einstein</td><td>Incomparable Genius</td><td>Genius</td></tr></table>\n\nGLHF!\n\n\n",
