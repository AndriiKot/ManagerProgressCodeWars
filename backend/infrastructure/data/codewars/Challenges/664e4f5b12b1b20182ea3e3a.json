  "description": "# Task\n\nWrite a function called `which_postcode`/`whichPostcode` that takes  a string, and determines whether it represents a British or Slovakian postcode. If the string is a valid British postcode, return `\"GB\"`. If it's a valid Slovakian postcode, return `\"SK\"`. If the input is neither a valid British nor a valid Slovakian postcode, return `\"Not valid\"`.  \n\nLeading and trailing spaces should be ignored, but if there are spaces in wrong place in the middle of the postcode, then it is invalid.  \n\nThe input will always be a valid British postcode, a valid Slovakian postcode or an invalid postcode.  \n\n# British Postcodes\nTo be considered valid, a British postcode must follow the rules below:  \n- Consists a mix of letters and numbers, seperated to two segments by a single space. \n- First segment must start with either 1 or 2 letters, followed by 1 or 2 numbers. Example: `G4`, `G40`, `DN4` or `DN11` \n- Second segment must start with a digit, followed by 2 letters. Example: `1AB`  \n\nBritish postcodes are not case-sensitive, so `Se21 7aA` is a valid postcode.  \n\n# Slovakian Postcodes  \n- Consists of 5 numbers, where the first 3 are seperated by a space from the last 2 numbers. Example: `123 45`.  \n\n## Examples  \n### Valid British postcodes:  \n- `  G4 7AH`\n- `G12 8NU   ` \n- `Dn1 1aA` \n- `SE21 7AA`  \n\n### Valid Slovakian postcodes:  \n- ` 040 01` \n- `810 08  `  \n- `984 59`\n\n### Invalid postcodes:  \n- `0765 820` - Should only have 3 numbers in the first segment, 2 numbers in the second segment\n- `SE 21 7AA` - Should only contain 2 segments\n- `070  08` - Should have single space separating the two segments, not double space",
