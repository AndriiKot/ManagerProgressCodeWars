  "description": "We are interested in collecting the sets of six prime numbers, that having a starting prime p, the following values are also primes forming the sextuplet ```[p, p + 4, p + 6, p + 10, p + 12, p + 16]```\n\nThe first sextuplet that we find is ```[7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]```\n\nThe second one is ```[97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113]```\n\nGiven a number ```sum_limit```, you should give the first sextuplet which sum (of its six primes) surpasses the sum_limit value.\n\n```python\nfind_primes_sextuplet(70) == [7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]\n\nfind_primes_sextuplet(600) == [97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113]\n```\nFeatures of the tests:\n```\nNumber Of Tests = 18\n10000 < sum_limit < 29700000\n```\nIf you have solved this kata perhaps you will find easy to solve this one:\nhttps://www.codewars.com/kata/primes-with-two-even-and-double-even-jumps/\nEnjoy it!!",
