  "description": "<i style=\"font-size:14px;\">This SQL task is a small token of my gratitude to those who have generously lent their time and expertise to help me create katas. Separately I want to express my gratitude to `dfhwze` who approved almost all my katas. Voile, Unnamed, Twilight_Sun, monadius and others for consistent solving of beta katas and providing valuable feeback. Your support has not only enriched my work but also inspiring me to pay the gift of knowledge forward!</i>\n\n### Description\n\nYour task is to implement a PostgreSQL PL/pgSQL function called `draw_heart` that will generate an ASCII art representation of a heart shape. The function should return this representation as rows of text in a PostgreSQL table.\n\nYour function should match the following signature:\n\n```sql\ncreate or replace function draw_heart(size integer)\nreturns table(heart_shape text) as $$\n-- Your implementation goes here\n$$ language plpgsql;\n```\n\nInput: \n\n* `size` (integer): An integer parameter indicating the size of the heart shape. The minimum size is 4.\n\nOutput\n\n* The function will return a table with a single column named heart_shape.\n* Each row in the table represents a row in the heart shape, filled with asterisks (\"*\") and spaces.\n\nFor example, for size 5, the pattern should be:\n\n```\n ** **      \n*******\n *****     \n  ***     \n   *\n```   \n\nLook tests for more examples.\n\nGLHF!",
