  "description": "**Ore Numbers** (also called Harmonic Divisor Numbers) are numbers for which the [harmonic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean) of all their divisors (including the number itself) equals an integer.\n\nFor example, 6 is an Ore Number because its harmonic mean is exactly 2:\n\n```\nH(6) = 4 / (1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6) = 2\n```\n\nYour task is to complete the function returns ```true``` if the given number is an Ore Number and ```false``` otherwise.\n\nYou can assume all inputs will be valid positive integers.\n\n**Hint:** The harmonic mean is the total number of divisors divided by the sum of their reciprocals.\n",
