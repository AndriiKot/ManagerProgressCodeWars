  "description": "It's your best friend's birthday! You already bought a box for the present. Now you want to pack the present in the box. You want to decorate the box with a ribbon and a bow.\n\nBut how much cm of ribbon do you need?\n\nWrite the method ```wrap``` that calculates that!\n\nA box has a ```height```, a ```width``` and a ```length``` (in cm). The ribbon is crossed on the side with the largest area. Opposite this side (also the side with the largest area) the loop is bound, calculate with ```20``` cm more tape.\n\n```java\n  wrap(17,32,11) => 162\n  wrap(13,13,13) => 124\n  wrap(1,3,1) => 32\n```\n\n```go\n  wrap(17,32,11) => 162\n  wrap(13,13,13) => 124\n  wrap(1,3,1) => 32\n```\n\n```python\n  wrap(17,32,11) => 162\n  wrap(13,13,13) => 124\n  wrap(1,3,1) => 32\n```\n\n```factor\n  17 32 11 wrap -> 162\n  13 13 13 wrap -> 124\n  1  3  1  wrap -> 32\n```\n\n```c\n  wrap(17, 32, 11)  =>  162\n  wrap(13, 13, 13)  =>  124\n  wrap( 1,  3,  1)  =>   32\n```\n\n```javascript\n  wrap(17,32,11) => 162\n  wrap(13,13,13) => 124\n  wrap(1,3,1) => 32\n```\n\nNotes: </br>\n```height```, ```width``` and ```length``` will always be ```>0``` </br>\n\nThe ribbon and the bow on the present looks like this:\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/30HbqCZ.png\"/>",
