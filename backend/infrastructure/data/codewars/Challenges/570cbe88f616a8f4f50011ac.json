  "description": "Bob is a theoretical coder - he doesn't write code, but comes up with theories, formulas and algorithm ideas. You are his secretary, and he has tasked you with writing the code for his newest project - a method for making the short form of a word. Write a function ```shortForm```(C# ```ShortForm```, Python ```short_form```) that takes a string and returns it converted into short form using the rule: <em>Remove all vowels, except for those that are the first or last letter. </em>Do not count 'y' as a vowel, and ignore case. Also note, the string given will not have any spaces; only one word, and only Roman letters. \n<br>\nExample:\n```\nshortForm(\"assault\");\nshort_form(\"assault\")\nShortForm(\"assault\");\n// should return \"asslt\"\n```\n\n<br> <br>\nAlso, FYI: I got all the words with no vowels from <br>\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_words_without_vowels",
