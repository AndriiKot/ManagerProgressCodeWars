  "description": "# Open/Closed Principle\n\nThe open/closed principle states that code should be closed for modification, yet open for extension. That means you should be able to add new functionality to an object or method without altering it.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a lambda, which by nature is lazily bound to the lexical context. Until you ```call``` a lambda, it is just a piece of data you can pass around.\n\n## Task at hand\n\nImplement 3 lambdas that alter a message based on emotion:\n\n```ruby\nspoken    =->(greeting) { ... } # \"hello WORLD\" --> \"Hello world.\"\nshouted   =->(greeting) { ... } # \"Hello world\" --> \"HELLO WORLD!\"\nwhispered =->(greeting) { ... } # \"HELLO WORLD\" --> \"hello world.\"\n```\n```python\nspoken    = lambda greeting: ... # \"hello WORLD\" --> \"Hello world.\"\nshouted   = lambda greeting: ... # \"Hello world\" --> \"HELLO WORLD!\"\nwhispered = lambda greeting: ... # \"HELLO WORLD\" --> \"hello world.\"\n```\n\nThen create a fourth lambda, this one will take one of the above\nlambdas and a message, and the last lambda will delegate the\nemotion and the message up the chain.\n\n```ruby\ngreet =->(style, msg) { ... }\n```\n```python\ngreet = lambda style, msg: ...\n```\n\n## Input\nInput message contains only ASCII alphabets and spaces.\n\n---\n\nWhile here we only test for `spoken`, `shouted`, and `whispered` emotions, the open/closed principle allows us to add functionality to the greet function using other emotions/lambdas as well.\nFor example, feeling like `L33tsp34k1ng` or `sPoNgEbOb MeMe-ing` today? No need to change the original greet function (**closed** for modification), you can just extend the greet function (**open** for extension) by passing a new lambda and message to the greet function.\nSo, embrace the power of open/closed principle now and make your code more flexible and easier to extend!",
