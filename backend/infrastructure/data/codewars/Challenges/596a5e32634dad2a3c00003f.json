  "description": "Imagine a book author has hired us to create a function that takes his book as a string as input and finds all instances of a letter that we will call 'x' (case-sensitive) and turns all the letters after 'x' into a capital letter. \n\nFor example.\n\nmakeEveryLetterAfterXCaps('and larry walked into the park late to chase a squirrel', 'l') \n\nShould return: \n\n\"and lArry walKed into the park lAte to chase a squirrel\"\n\nIf the letter after x is already in caps it should stay in caps. \n\nNote that the swapping occurs considering the modified string, so  `makeEveryLetterAfterXCaps('aaaa', 'a')` will result into `\"aAaA\"`",
