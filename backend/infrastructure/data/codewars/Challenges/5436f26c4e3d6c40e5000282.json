  "description": "A [sequence or a series](http://world.mathigon.org/Sequences), in mathematics, is a string of objects, like numbers, that follow a particular pattern. The individual elements in a sequence are called terms. A simple example is `3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, ...`, where the pattern is: _\"add 3 to the previous term\"_.\n\nIn this kata, we will be using a more complicated sequence:   `0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ...`\nThis sequence is generated with the pattern: _\"the nth term is the sum of numbers from 0 to n, inclusive\"_.\n\n```\n[ 0,  1,    3,      6,   ...]\n  0  0+1  0+1+2  0+1+2+3\n```\n\n## Your Task\n\nComplete the function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list/array of length `abs(n) + 1` of the arithmetic series explained above. When`n < 0` return the sequence with negative terms.\n\n## Examples \n\n```\n 5  -->  [0,  1,  3,  6,  10,  15]\n-5  -->  [0, -1, -3, -6, -10, -15]\n 7  -->  [0,  1,  3,  6,  10,  15,  21,  28]\n```\n",
