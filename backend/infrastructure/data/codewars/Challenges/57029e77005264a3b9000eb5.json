  "description": "The notorious Captain Schneider has given you a very straightforward mission. Any data that comes through the system make sure that only non-special characters see the light of day.\n\nCreate a function that given a string, retains only the letters A-Z (upper and lowercase), 0-9 digits, and whitespace characters. Also, returns \"Not a string!\" if the entry type is not a string.",
