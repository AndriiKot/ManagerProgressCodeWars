  "description": "## Help the frog to find a way to freedom\n---\n\n\nYou have an array of integers and have a frog at the first position \n\n`[Frog, int, int, int, ..., int]`\n\nThe integer itself may tell you the length and the direction of the jump \n\n ```\n For instance:\n  2 = jump two indices to the right\n -3 = jump three indices to the left\n  0 = stay at the same position\n ```\n  \nYour objective is to find how many jumps are needed to jump out of the array.\n\nReturn `-1` if Frog can't jump out of the array\n\n```\nExample:\narray = [1, 2, 1, 5]; \njumps = 3  (1 -> 2 -> 5 -> <jump out>)\n\n```\n\n*All tests for this Kata are randomly generated.*",
