  "description": "Four-digit palindromes start with `[1001,1111,1221,1331,1441,1551,1551,...]` and the number at position `2` is `1111`.  \n\nYou will be given two numbers `a` and `b`. Your task is to return the `a-digit` palindrome at position `b` if the palindromes were arranged in increasing order. \n\nTherefore, `palin(4,2) = 1111`, because that is the second element of the `4-digit` palindrome series.\n\nMore examples in the test cases. Good luck!\n\nIf you like palindrome Katas, please try:\n\n[Palindrome integer composition](https://www.codewars.com/kata/599b1a4a3c5292b4cc0000d5)\n\n[Life without primes](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59f8750ac374cba8f0000033)\n\n\n\n",
