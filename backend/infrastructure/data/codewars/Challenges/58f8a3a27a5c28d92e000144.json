  "description": "Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.\n\nBy not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.\n\nE.g. If we have an array `[1,2,3,4,6,7,8]` then `1` then `2` then `3` then `4` are all consecutive but `6` is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.\n\n```if:c\nIf a non consecutive number is found then return `true` and set the passed in pointer to the number found.\n\nIf the whole array is consecutive then return `false`.\n```\n```if-not:c\nIf the whole array is consecutive then return `null`<sup>2</sup>.\n```\nThe array will always have at least `2` elements<sup>1</sup> and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n### Encodings\npurity: `LetRec`  \nnumEncoding: `Scott` ( no, there will not be negative numbers )  \n\nexport constructors `nil, cons` for your `List` encoding,  \nand deconstructor `option` for you `Option` encoding.\n~~~\n---\n```if:c\n<sup>1</sup> Can you write a solution that will return `false` for both `[]` and `[ x ]` (an empty array and one with a single number) though? (This is an empty array and one with a single number and is not tested for, but you can write your own example test. )\n```\n```if-not:c\n<sup>1</sup> Can you write a solution that will return `null`<sup>2</sup> for both `[]` and `[ x ]` though?  (This is an empty array and one with a single number and is not tested for, but you can write your own example test. )\n\n<sup>2</sup>  \n* Swift, Ruby and Crystal: `nil`\n* Haskell: `Nothing`  \n* Python, Rust, Scala, Lambda Calculus: `None`  \n* Julia: `nothing`  \n* Nim: `none(int)` (See [options](https://nim-lang.org/docs/options.html))\n* C++: `std::nullopt`\n```",
