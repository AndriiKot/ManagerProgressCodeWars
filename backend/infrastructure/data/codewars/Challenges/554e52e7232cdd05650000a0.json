  "description": "Create a function that receives a string consists of only digit characters (`'0'` to `'9'`), and returns the lowest product of 4 **consecutive digits** within that string.\n\n\nThis should only work if the number has 4 digits or more. If not, return `\"Number is too small\"` instead.\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\n\"123456789\" --> 24    // 1*2*3*4\n\"35\" --> \"Number is too small\"\n```",
