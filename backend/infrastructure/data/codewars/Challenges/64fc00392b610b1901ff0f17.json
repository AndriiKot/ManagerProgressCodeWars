  "description": "Let's say that there exists a machine that gives out free coins, but with a twist!\n\nSeparating two people is a wall, and this machine is placed in such a way that both people are able to access it. Spending a coin in this machine will give the person on the other side **3 coins** and vice versa.\n\nIf both people continually spend coins for each other (SHARING), then they'll both gain a net profit of **2 coins per turn.** However, there is always the possibility for someone to act selfishly (STEALING): they spend no coins, yet they still receive the generous **3 coin** gift from the other person!\n\n*Here's an example of Red taking advantage of Green!*\n![Red chose to betray](https://i.imgur.com/5LYb30N.png)\n\n### The Challenge\nAssuming that both people **start with 3 coins each**, create a function that calculates both people's final number of coins. You will be given two arrays of strings, with each string being the words `\"share\"` or `\"steal\"`.\n\n### Examples\n```\n[\"share\"], [\"share\"] ➞ (5, 5)\n// Both people spend one coin, and receive 3 coins each.\n\n[\"steal\"], [\"share\"] ➞ (6, 2)\n// Person 1 gains 3 coins, while person 2 loses a coin.\n\n[\"steal\"], [\"steal\"] ➞ (3, 3)\n// Neither person spends any coins and so no one gets rewarded.\n\n[\"share\", \"share\", \"share\"], [\"steal\", \"share\", \"steal\"] ➞ (3, 11)\n```\n\n### Notes\n- No tests will include a negative number of coins.\n- All words will be given in lowercase.",
