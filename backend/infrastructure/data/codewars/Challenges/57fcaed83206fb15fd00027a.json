  "description": "## Task\n\nWrite a method, that replaces every nth char _oldValue_ with char _newValue_.\n\n## Inputs\n\n* `text`: the string to modify\n* `n`: change the target letter every `n`<sup>th</sup> occurrencies\n* `old_value` (or similar): the targetted character\n* `new_value` (or similar): the character to use as replacement\n\nNote for untyped languages: all inputs are always valid and of their expected type.\n\n## Rules\n\n* Your method has to be case sensitive!\n* If n is 0 or negative or if it is larger than the count of the oldValue, return the original text without a change.\n\n## Example:\n```\nn:         2\nold_value: 'a'\nnew_value: 'o'\n\"Vader said: No, I am your father!\"\n  1     2          3        4       -> 2nd and 4th occurence are replaced\n\"Vader soid: No, I am your fother!\"\n```\n\nAs you can see in the example: The first changed is the 2nd 'a'. So the start is always at the nth suitable char and not at the first!",
