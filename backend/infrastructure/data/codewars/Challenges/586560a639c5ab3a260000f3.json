  "description": "**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students**\n\nYour family runs a shop and have just brought a Scrolling Text Machine (http://3.imimg.com/data3/RP/IP/MY-2369478/l-e-d-multicolour-text-board-250x250.jpg) to help get some more business.  \n\nThe scroller works by replacing the current text string with a similar text string, but with the first letter shifted to the end; this simulates movement.  \n\nYour father is far too busy with the business to worry about such details, so, naturally, he's making you come up with the text strings.\n\nCreate a function that accepts a string argument and returns an array of strings with each letter from the input string being rotated to the end.\n\n## Examples:\n\n```javascript\n\"Hello\" --> [\"elloH\", \"lloHe\", \"loHel\", \"oHell\", \"Hello\"]\n```\n\n## Note:\n\n* The original string should be included in the output array.\n\n* The order matters. Each element of the output array should be the rotated version of the previous element.\n\n* The output array SHOULD be the same length as the input string.\n\n* The function should return an empty array with an empty string (`''`) as input.",
