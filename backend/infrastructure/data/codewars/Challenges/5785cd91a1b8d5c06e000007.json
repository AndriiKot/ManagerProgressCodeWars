  "description": "There is a sentence that has a mistake in its ordering.\n\nThe part with a capital letter should be the first word.\n\nPlease write a function to re-order the words, so that the word starting with a capital letter is moved to the front.\n\nEach word in the string is separated by a single space.\n\nIn the string, there will always be exactly one word with a capital letter in it.\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\n\"ming Yao\" --> \"Yao ming\"\n\"Mano donowana\" --> \"Mano donowana\"\n\"wario LoBan hello\" --> \"LoBan wario hello\"\n\"bull color pig Patrick\" --> \"Patrick bull color pig\"\n```\n",
