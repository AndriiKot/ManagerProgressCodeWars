  "description": "<font size=1px>Description overhauled by V</font>\n\n---\n\nI've invited some kids for my son's birthday, during which I will give to each kid some amount of candies.\n\nEvery kid hates receiving less amount of candies than any other kids, and I don't want to have any candies left - giving it to my kid would be bad for his teeth.\n\nHowever, not every kid invited will come to my birthday party.\n\nWhat is the minimum amount of candies I have to buy, so that no matter how many kids come to the party in the end, I can still ensure that each kid can receive the same amount of candies, while leaving no candies left?\n\nIt's ensured that at least one kid will participate in the party.",
