  "description": "Your task is to create a SQL query that generates an alternating pattern of stars (*) and numbers. The pattern should start with a single star, followed by the number \"1\". The stars increase one by one, and the number on the row should match the count of stars on the previous row.\n\nComplete the SQL query started in the `PREPARE` statement. The query must accept a single integer parameter that refers to the variable number of steps. The placeholder `$1` should be used for this parameter.\n\nFor 5 steps, the output should look like:\n\n ```\n pattern\n---------\n *\n 1\n **\n 2\n ***\n ```\n \nNotes:\n\n* The query should return a single column, `pattern`, where each row contains a string made up of stars or a number converted to text datatype\n\nGLHF!",
