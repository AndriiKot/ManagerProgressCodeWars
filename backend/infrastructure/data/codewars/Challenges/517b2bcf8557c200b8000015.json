  "description": "Something is wrong with our Warrior class. All variables should initialize properly and the attack method is not working as expected.\n\nIf properly set, it should correctly calculate the damage after an attack (if the attacker position is == to the block position of the defender: no damage; otherwise, the defender gets 10 damage if hit \"high\" or 5 damage if hit \"low\". If no block is set, the defender takes 5 **extra** damage.\n\nFor some reason, the health value is not being properly set. The following shows an example of this code being used:\n\n```javascript\nvar ninja = new Warrior('Ninja');\nvar samurai = new Warrior('Samurai');\n\nninja.block = Position.high;\nsamurai.attack(ninja, Position.low);\n// ninja.health should == 95\n```\n```python\nninja = Warrior('Hanzo Hattori')\nsamurai = Warrior('Ryōma Sakamoto')\n\nsamurai.block = 'l'\nninja.attack(samurai, 'h')\n# samurai.health should be 90 now\n```\n```ruby\nninja = Warrior('Hanzo Hattori')\nsamurai = Warrior('Ryoma Sakamoto')\n\nsamurai.block = 'l'\nninja.attack(samurai, 'h')\n# samurai.health should be 90 now\n```\nThe warrios must be able to fight to the bitter end, and good luck to the most skilled!\n\nNotice that health can't be below 0: once hit to 0 health, a warrior attribute `deceased` becomes `true`; if hit again, the `zombie` attribute becomes `true` too!",
