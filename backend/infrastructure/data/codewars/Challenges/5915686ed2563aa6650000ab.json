  "description": "# Task\n`EvilCode` is a game similar to `Codewars`. You have to solve programming tasks as quickly as possible. However, unlike `Codewars`, `EvilCode` awards you with a medal, depending on the time you took to solve the task.\n\nTo get a medal, your time must be (strictly) inferior to the time corresponding to the medal. You can be awarded `\"Gold\", \"Silver\" or \"Bronze\"` medal, or `\"None\"` medal at all. Only one medal (the best achieved) is awarded.\n\nYou are given the time achieved for the task and the time corresponding to each medal. Your task is to return the awarded medal.\n\nEach time is given in the format `HH:MM:SS`.\n\n\n# Input/Output\n\n`[input]` string `userTime`\n\nThe time the user achieved.\n\n`[input]` string `gold`\n\nThe time corresponding to the gold medal.\n\n`[input]` string `silver`\n\nThe time corresponding to the silver medal.\n\n`[input]` string `bronze`\n\nThe time corresponding to the bronze medal.\n\nIt is guaranteed that `gold < silver < bronze`.\n\n`[output]` a string\n\nThe medal awarded, one of for options: `\"Gold\", \"Silver\", \"Bronze\" or \"None\"`.\n\n# Example\n\n```\nuserTime = \"00:30:00\"\ngold = \"00:15:00\"\nsilver = \"00:45:00\" \nbronze = \"01:15:00\"\n\nthe output should be \"Silver\"\n```\n\n\n```\nuserTime = \"01:15:00\"\ngold = \"00:15:00\"\nsilver = \"00:45:00\" \nbronze = \"01:15:00\"\n\nthe output should be \"None\"\n```\n\n~~~~if:haskell\n# For Haskell version\n```\nIn Haskell, the result is a Maybe, returning Just String indicating \nthe medal if they won or Nothing if they don't.\n```\n~~~~",
