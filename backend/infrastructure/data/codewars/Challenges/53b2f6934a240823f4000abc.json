  "description": "Write a function that will take an array and a person object as parameters. The function will only push a \"person\" object onto the end of an array if someone with that phone number doesn't already exist in that array.\n\n-A \"person\" is a javascript object with a name and a phoneNumber : {name:'SomeName', phoneNumber:1234567890}  \n-A duplicate person object is an object with the same phoneNumber as someone else\n\nIf the person object is unique, push them onto the end of the array, and return true.  \nIf the person object is NOT unique, don't push them to the array and return false;  \nIf the person doesn't have a phoneNumber, don't add them to the array and return false.  \n",
