  "description": "# Task\n\nYou are given a string `digits` and an integer `size`(1-9). Your task is to generate a result like this:\n\n```\nshow(\"888\",1) ===\n -  -  -\n| || || |\n -  -  -\n| || || |\n -  -  -\n\nshow(\"888\",2) ===\n --  --  --\n|  ||  ||  |\n|  ||  ||  |\n --  --  --\n|  ||  ||  |\n|  ||  ||  |\n --  --  --\n\nshow(\"1234567890\",3) ===\n      ---  ---       ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---\n    |    |    ||   ||    |        ||   ||   ||   |\n    |    |    ||   ||    |        ||   ||   ||   |\n    |    |    ||   ||    |        ||   ||   ||   |\n      ---  ---  ---  ---  ---       ---  ---\n    ||        |    |    ||   |    ||   |    ||   |\n    ||        |    |    ||   |    ||   |    ||   |\n    ||        |    |    ||   |    ||   |    ||   |\n      ---  ---       ---  ---       ---  ---  ---\n```\nAs you can see:\n\n- Use '-' represents the horizontal line; Use '|' represents the vertical line. \n\n- `size` determines the length of the horizontal line and the height of the vertical line. i.e. If size is 1, the horizontal line is `-`; If size is 2, the horizontal line is `--`. and so on..\n\n- Each row is separated by `\"\\n\"`.\n\n- To keep shapes, other places are filled with spaces. Except for the end of each line.\n\n- Happy Coding `^_^`\n",
