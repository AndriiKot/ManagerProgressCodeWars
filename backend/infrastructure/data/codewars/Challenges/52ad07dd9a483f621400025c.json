  "description": "It's almost Christmas and you have a pretty cool Christmas Calendar with tasty sweets and awesome toys in it. As curious as you are, you want to open all the doors. But unfortunately only the *today's* door can be opened. Can you find a way to open the 24th door already? :)\n\nPS: Yes, if you do this kata on December 24th, you'll get a solved kata for free. But the other 364 days of the year, you have to trick a bit.\n\nGood Luck and Merry X-Mas!",
