  "description": "The accounts of the \"Fat to Fit Club (FFC)\" association are supervised by John as a volunteered accountant.\nThe association is funded through financial donations from generous benefactors. John has a list of\nthe first `n` donations: `[14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15]`\nHe wants to know how much the next benefactor should give to the association so that the \naverage of the first `n + 1` donations should reach an average of `30`.\nAfter doing the math he found `149`. He thinks that he could have made a mistake.\n\nCould you help him?\n\n## Task\nThe function should return the expected donation\n(rounded up to the next integer) that will permit to reach the average. \n\nShould the last donation be a non positive number `(<= 0)` John wants us either to throw an error or return such value so he will clearly see that his expectations are not great enough.\n\n*In \"Sample Tests\" you can see what to return.*\n\n### Notes: \n\n- all donations and new average are numbers (integers or floats), array of donations can be empty.\n- See examples below and \"Sample Tests\" to see which return is to be done.\n\n```\narray: [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], new average: 92 -> result: 645\narray: [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], new average: 2  -> result: variable, see \"Sample Tests\" \n```\n\n\n",
