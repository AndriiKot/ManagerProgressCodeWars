  "description": "You are given a positive integer **n** greater than one.\n\nHow many ways are there to represent it as a product of some **Fibonacci numbers** greater than one?\n\n*(Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...).*\n\nFor example, there are two ways for **n = 40**:\n1) 2 * 2 * 2 * 5\n2) 5 * 8\n\nBut you can't represent **n = 7** in an aforementioned way.\n\nNote that n may be really big (**up to 10^36**). Good luck!",
