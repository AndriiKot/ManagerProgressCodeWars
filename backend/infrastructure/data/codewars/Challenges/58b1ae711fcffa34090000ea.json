  "description": "# Situation\nYou have been hired by a company making electric garage doors. Accidents with the present product line have resulted in numerous damaged cars, broken limbs and several killed pets. Your mission is to write a safer version of their controller software.\n\n# Specification\nWe always start with a closed door. The remote control has exactly one button, with the following behaviour.\n\n+ If the door is closed, a push starts opening the door, and vice-versa\n+ It takes 5 seconds for the door to open or close completely\n+ While the door is moving, one push pauses movement, another push resumes movement in the same direction\n\nIn order to make the door safer, it has been equipped with resistance-based obstacle detection. When the door detects an obstacle, it must immediately reverse the direction of movement.\n\n# Input\nA string where each character represents one second, with the following possible values.\n\n* ```'.'``` No event\n* ```'P'``` Button has been pressed\n* ```'O'``` Obstacle has been detected (supersedes P)\n\nAs an example, ```'..P....'``` means that nothing happens for two seconds, then the button is pressed, then no further events.\n\n# Output\nA string where each character represents one second and indicates the position of the door (0 if fully closed and 5 fully open). The door starts moving immediately, hence its position changes at the same second as the event.\n\n# Example\n```..P...O.....``` as input should yield\n```001234321000``` as output\n",
