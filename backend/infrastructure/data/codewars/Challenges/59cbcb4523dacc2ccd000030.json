  "description": "What is the rank of a playing card? The function takes a string like '2c' or 'Kh' and returns a value based on rank of the card. The first character corresponds to the rank of the card and the second character corresponds to the suit of the card. Cards 2-9 should return the corresponding number. T returns 10, J => 11, Q => 12, K => 13 and A => 14. Otherwise the rank should be returned as 0.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\nrank('2c') == 2;\nrank('Tc') == 10;\nrank('As') == 14;\nrank('1c') == 0; // There is no card '1'\n```\n\nSuits can be disregarded.",
