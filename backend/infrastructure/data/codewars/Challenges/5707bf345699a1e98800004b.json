  "description": "You are presented with a single knight on a chess board. \nYour task is to count the number of unique positions that knight could reach using exactly two moves.\nIn chess a knight can move either 2 squares horizonally and 1 square vertically OR 2 squares vertically and one square horizontally. It must stay on the board at all times (8x8 squares).\n\nThe chess board will be presented as a 2D array. The knight's position is indicated by a \"K\" and empty squares \"0\"\n\n```\n[ [ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' ],\n  [ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' ],\n  [ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'K', '0', '0' ],\n  [ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'I' ],\n  [ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' ],\n  [ '0', '0', 'V', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' ],\n  [ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' ],\n  [ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' ] ]\n\n\n```\n\nMake sure to return the number of unique end positions for the knight as it may be able to reach the same location via different routes. \n\nAlso bear in mind the kinght can return to its starting position. \n\nDo not count positions the knight can reach in one move but not in two.\n\nFor example, in the above grid, the cell marked with an 'I' can be reached in one move, but a second move will take the knight away from this square, making this an invalid endpoint. \n\nThe position marked with a 'V' is an example of a valid endpoint.\n\n",
