  "description": "In genetic algorithms, crossover is a genetic operator used to vary the programming of chromosomes from one generation to the next.\n\nThe one-point crossover consists in swapping one's cromosome part with another in a specific given point. The image bellow shows the crossover being applied on chromosomes `1011011001111` and `1011100100110` with the cut point (index) `4`:\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/nZ4hgnS.gif)\n\nIn this kata you have to implement a function that receives two chromosomes `chromosome1`, `chromosome2` and a zero-based `index` and it has to return an array with the crossover result on both chromosomes `[chromosome1, chromosome2]`.\n\n\n# Example:\n\n```python\nchromosome1 = \"111000\"\nchromosome2 = \"000110\"\nindex = 3\n# should return [\"111110\", \"000000\"]\n```\n\n\n# See other katas from this series\n\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #1 Generate](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-1-generate)\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #2 Mutation](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-2-mutation)\n  - **Genetic Algorithm Series - #3 Crossover**\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #4 Get population and fitnesses](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-4-get-population-and-fitnesses)\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #5 Roulette wheel selection](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-5-roulette-wheel-selection)\n\n*This kata is a piece of  ![2 kyu](http://i.imgur.com/CGlQhDW.png) [Binary Genetic Algorithm](http://www.codewars.com/kata/526f35b9c103314662000007)*\n",
