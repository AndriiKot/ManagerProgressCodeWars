  "description": "For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the `people` table, and join to the `toys` table so that you can return the COUNT of the toys\n\n### people table schema\n- id\n- name\n\n### toys table schema\n- id\n- name\n- people_id\n\nYou should return all people fields as well as the toy count as \"toy_count\".\n\n> NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.",
