  "description": "This kata is part of the collection [Mary's Puzzle Books](https://www.codewars.com/collections/marys-puzzle-books).\n\n# Zero Terminated Sum\n\nMary has another puzzle book, and it's up to you to help her out! This book is filled with zero-terminated substrings, and you have to find the substring with the largest sum of its digits. For example, one puzzle looks like this:\n```\n\"72102450111111090\"\n```\nHere, there are 4 different substrings: `721`, `245`, `111111`, and `9`. The sums of their digits are `10`, `11`, `6`, and `9` respectively. Therefore, the substring with the largest sum of its digits is `245`, and its sum is `11`.\n\nWrite a function `largest_sum` which takes a string and returns the maximum of the sums of the substrings. In the example above, your function should return `11`.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- A substring can have length 0. For example, `123004560` has three substrings, and the middle one has length 0.\n- All inputs will be valid strings of digits, and the last digit will always be `0`.",
