  "description": "### A square of squares\n\nYou like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!\n\nHowever, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain… Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a _perfect square_.\n\n### Task\n\nGiven an integral number, determine if it's a [square number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number):\n\n> In mathematics, a __square number__ or __perfect square__ is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.\n\nThe tests will _always_ use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.\n\n### Examples\n\n```\n-1  =>  false\n 0  =>  true\n 3  =>  false\n 4  =>  true\n25  =>  true\n26  =>  false\n```\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n### Encodings\n\npurity: `LetRec`  \nnumEncoding: `BinaryScott` ( so no negative numbers )  \nexport deconstructor `if` for your `Boolean` encoding  \n~~~",
