  "description": "## Explanation\nWrite a function that shortens a string to a given length. Instead of cutting the string from the end, your function will shorten it from the middle like shrinking.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nsentence = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nres = shorten(sentence, 27)\n\nres === \"The quick br...the lazy dog\"\n```\n\nYour function should also accept an optional argument `glue` to get the parts together.\n\n```\nsentence = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nres = shorten(sentence, 27, '---')\n\nres === \"The quick br---the lazy dog\"\n```\n\n## Rules are simple:\n\n- Result must always be equal to the given `length`\n- Only exception to above rule is, when string is already shorter than given length. In that case string should be returned untouched.\n- If no `glue` is sent `...` should be used by default\n- If `glue` cannot go exactly in the middle, **second part** should be longer\n- If glue cannot fit in the shortened string, string should be shortened without shrinking.\n  - meaning; `shorten('hello world', 5, '....')` should return `hello` because 4 char glue cannot fit in the shortened string.\n  - glue must have at least 1 char on both ends. Example minimum `h...d`, results `....d` or `h....` are not excepted. \n- You can assume you'll always receive a `string` as the sentence and the glue. And `integer number` for the length.\n- Think about other possible edge cases, there are some surprises.\n\n\n",
