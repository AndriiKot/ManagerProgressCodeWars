  "description": "For a new 3D game that will be released, a team of programmers needs an easy function. (Then it will be processed as a method in a Class, forget this concept for Ruby)\n\nWe have an sphere with center <b>O</b>, having in the space the coordinates `[α, β, γ]` and radius `r`  and a list of points, `points_list`, each one with coordinates `[x, y, z]`. Select the biggest triangle (or triangles) that has (have) all its (their) 3 vertice(s) as interior points of the sphere (not even in the sphere contour). You should consider that a point P is interior if its distance to center O, d, is such that:\n\n<code>\nd < r\n</code>\n<span style=\"margin: 0 5px 0 10px\">and </span>\n<code>\n|(d - r) / r| > 10<sup>-10</sup>\n</code>\n\nLet's see the situation with the following points in the image posted below:\n```python\nA = [1,2,-4]; B = [-3, 2, 4]; C = [7, 8, -4]; D = [2, 3, 5]; E = [-2, -1, 1]\n```\n\nThe sphere has the following features:\n```\nO = [1, 2, -2] (Center of the sphere)\nradius = 8\n```\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/dtZGfIN\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/dtZGfIN.gif\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nAs C is the only exterior point of the sphere, the possible triangles that have their vertices interior to the sphere are: \n\n```\nABD, ABE, ADE, BDE\n```\n\nLet's see which is the biggest one:\n\n```python\nTriangle    Triangle with its points         Area\nABD        [[1,2,-4],[-3,2,4],[2,3,5]]    22.44994432064\nABE        [[1,2,-4],[-3,2,4],[-2,-1,1]]  13.56465996625\nADE        [[1,2,-4],[2,3,5],[-2,-1,1]]   22.62741699796 <---- biggest triangle\nBDE        [[-3,2,4],[2,3,5],[-2,-1,1]]   11.31370849898\n```\n\n\n\n~~~if:javascript\nOur function `biggestTriangInt()` should output for this case:\n\n```javascript\npointsList = [[1,2,-4], [-3, 2, 4], [7, 8, -4], [2, 3, 5], [-2, -1, 1]]\ncenter = [1, 2, -2]\nradius = 8\nbiggestTriangInt(pointsList, center, radius) == [4, 22.62741699796,  [[1,2,-4],[2,3,5],[-2,-1,1]]]\n```\n~~~\n\n~~~if-not:javascript\nOur function `biggest_triang_int()` should output for this case:\n\n```python\npoints_list = [[1,2,-4], [-3, 2, 4], [7, 8, -4], [2, 3, 5], [-2, -1, 1]]\ncenter = [1, 2, -2]\nradius = 8\nbiggest_triang_int(points_list, center, radius) == [4, 22.62741699796,  [[1,2,-4],[2,3,5],[-2,-1,1]]]\n```\n~~~\n\n\nThat means that with the given points list we may generate 4 triangles with all their vertices as interior points of the sphere, the biggest triangle has an area of 22.62741699796 (the units does not matter and the values for the area should not be rounded) and finally, there is only one triangle with this maximum value.\nEvery triangle should be output having the same order of its vertices than in the given list of points. B = [-3,2,4], comes before than D =[2,3,5] and the last one E = [-2,-1,1]\nIf in the result we have only one triangle, the function should output a list of three points.\n\nLet'see the next case:\n\n```python\npoints_list = [[1,2,-4], [-3, 2, 4], [7, 8, -4], [2, 3, 5], [-2, -1, 1],\n              [3, 2, 6], [1, 4, 0], [-4, -5, -6], [4, 5, 6], [-2, -3, -5],\n              [-1, -2, 4], [-3, -2, -6], [-1, -4, 0], [2, 1, -1]]\nsphere_center = [0, 0, 0]\nradius = 8\nbiggest_triang_int(points_list, sphere_center, radius) == [165, 33.645207682521445, [[[1, 2, -4], [3, 2, 6], [-1, -4, 0]], [[1, 4, 0], [-1, -2, 4], [-3, -2, -6]]]]\n```\n\nNow there are a total of 165 triangles with their vertices in the sphere, the biggest triangle has an area of 33.645207682521445 but we have two triangles with this area value. The vertices of each triangle respect the order of the points list as we expressed before but the additional detail is that the triangles are sorted by the values of the coordinates of their points. Let's compare the coordinates of the first point\n\n```\nFirst point   x  y  z\nTriangle1     1  2 -4  <--- this triangle is first in the result\nTriangle2     1  4  0\n              |  |\n              |  y1 < y2 (2, 4)\n              |\n              x1 = x2     (1 = 1)\n```\n\nIn the case that all the given points are exterior to the sphere the function should output the empty list.\n\nThe points in the list are all valid and each one occurs once.\n\nRemember that if three points are collinear do not form a triangle. For practical purposes you may consider that if the area of a triangle is lower than 10<sup>-8</sup>, the points are aligned.\n\nEnjoy it!\n\n",
