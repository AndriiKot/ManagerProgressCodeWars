  "description": "You have an 8-wind compass, like this:\n![](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/compass-rose-eight-abbreviated-initials-260nw-1453270079.jpg)\n\nYou receive the direction you are `facing` (one of the 8 directions: `N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW`) and a certain degree to `turn` (a multiple of 45, between -1080 and 1080); positive means clockwise, and negative means counter-clockwise.\n\nReturn the direction you will face after the turn.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\n\"S\",  180  -->  \"N\"\n\"SE\", -45  -->  \"E\"\n\"W\",  495  -->  \"NE\"\n```\n```haskell\nS  180  ->  N\nSE -45  ->  E\nW  495  ->  NE\n```\n\n---\n\n### My other katas\n\nIf you enjoyed this kata then please try [my other katas](https://www.codewars.com/users/anter69/authored)! :-)\n\n#### *Translations are welcome!*",
