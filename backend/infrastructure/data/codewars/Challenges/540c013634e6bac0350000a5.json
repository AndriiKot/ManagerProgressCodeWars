  "description": "Mrs. Frizzle is beginning to plan lessons for her science class next semester, and wants to encourage friendship amongst her students.  To accomplish her goal, Mrs. Frizzle will ensure ***each student has a chance to partner with every other student in the class*** in a series of science projects.\n\nMrs. Frizzle does not know who will be in her class next semester, but she does know she will have `n` students total in her class.\n\n## Specifications\n\nCreate the function `projectPartners` with the parameter `n` representing the number of students in Mrs. Frizzle's class.  The function should return the total number of unique pairs she can make with `n` students.\n\n```\nprojectPartners(2)\n  --> returns 1\n  \nprojectPartners(4)\n  --> returns 6\n```\n\n## Remarks\n\n- your solution ***should not contain any arrays*** or objects that are used similar to an array. Note that Haskell will use rather large numbers, such as `10^40`, so any list-based solution will autmatically fail the test.\n\n- your function will only recieve a single number that is `greater than or equal to 2` -- you do not need to worry about input validation.\n",
