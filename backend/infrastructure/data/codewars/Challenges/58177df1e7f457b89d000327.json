  "description": "If you deposit $100 each year into a bank account with yearly 1% interest rate, how many years will it take you to accumulate minimum $5000? What if the interest is 3% instead?\n\nThis is the question you will answer in this kata for the interest rates 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6% given a yearly deposit amount and target amount.\n\nIt works like this:\n\n- The user inputs a fixed amount they wish to deposit each year and a minimum retirement target\n- The function calculates how many years it will take to reach the retirement target using various yearly fixed interest rates: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 %\n- All deposits happen on 1. January and all interests are deposited 31st December\n\nYou will create a function which takes paramters (```yearly_deposit```) and (```min_target_balance```) that returns a dictionairy of (interest rate, years to save) pairs.\n\nFor javascript return an object where the key is string and value is int.\n\nSee example:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_retirement(yearly_deposit, min_target_balance):\n    '''\n    @param yearly_deposit (int) yearly deposit amount\n    @param min_target_balance (int) minimum target balance\n    @return dictionary of (interest rate (int), years to save (int)) pair\n    '''\n    pass\n  \n\ncalculate_retirement(100, 300) => {1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 3, 4: 3, 5: 3, 6: 3}\n\n# This tells us that at interest rate 1% it takes 3 years,\n# at interest rate 2% it takes 3 years...etc\n \n# 2 % interest rate explained:\n# Year 1: 1.jan 100 deposited into account\n# Year 1: 31.dec interest payment (100 * 1.02) = 102 (new balance)\n# Year 2: 1.jan 100 deposited into account, 202 (new balance)\n# Year 2: 31.dec interest payment 202 * 1.02 = 206.04 (new balance)\n# Year 3: 1.jan 100 deposited into account, 306.04 (new balance)\n# Year 3: 31.dec interest payment 306.04 * 1.02 = 312.1608 (new balance)\n\n# Minimum target was 300 which was reached during 3rd year,\n# the answer is 3 for interest rate 2%\n\ncalculate_retirement(100, 700) => {1: 7, 2: 7, 3: 7, 4: 7, 5: 6, 6: 6}\n\ncalculate_retirement(100, 1000) => {1: 10, 2: 10, 3: 9, 4: 9, 5: 8, 6: 8}\n\ncalculate_retirement(100, 10000) => {1: 70, 2: 55, 3: 47, 4: 41, 5: 36, 6: 33}\n```\n\nInfo:\n\n- No silly test cases will be used such as: negative/0 deposit amount, negative/0 target balance, astronomical input sizes.\n\n",
