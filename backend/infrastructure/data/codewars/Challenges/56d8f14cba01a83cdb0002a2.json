  "description": "Imagine that you have an array of 3 integers each representing different person. Each number can be 0, 1, or 2 which represents the number of hands that person is holding up.\n\nNow imagine there is a sequence which follows these rules:\n* None of the people have their arms raised at first\n* Firstly, a person raises 1 hand; then they raise the second hand; after that they put both hands down - these steps form a cycle\n* Person #1 performs these steps all the time, person #2 advances only after person #1 puts their hands down, and person #3 advances only after person #2 puts their hands down\n\nThe first 10 steps of the sequence represented as a table are:\n\n```\nStep   P1   P2   P3\n--------------------\n 0     0    0    0\n 1     1    0    0\n 2     2    0    0\n 3     0    1    0\n 4     1    1    0\n 5     2    1    0\n 6     0    2    0\n 7     1    2    0\n 8     2    2    0\n 9     0    0    1\n```\n\nGiven a number, return an array, containing 3 integers, each representing the number of hands raised by each person at that step, starting from `0`.",
