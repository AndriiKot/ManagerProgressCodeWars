  "description": "You are an aerial firefighter (someone who drops water on fires from above in order to extinguish them) and your goal is to work out the minimum amount of bombs you need to drop in order to fully extinguish the fire (the fire department has budgeting concerns and you can't just be dropping tons of bombs, they need that money for the annual christmas party).\n\nThe given string is a 2D plane of random length consisting of two characters: \n* `x` representing fire\n* `Y` representing buildings. \n\nWater that you drop cannot go through buildings and therefore individual sections of fire must be addressed separately.\n\nYour water bombs can only extinguish contiguous sections of fire up to a width (parameter `w`).\n\nYou must return the minimum number of waterbombs it would take to extinguish the fire in the string.\n\n**Note:** all inputs will be valid.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n\n```\n\"xxYxx\" and w = 3      -->  2 waterbombs needed\n\"xxYxx\" and w = 1      -->  4\n\"xxxxYxYx\" and w = 5   -->  3\n\"xxxxxYxYx\" and w = 2  -->  5\n```\n\n<!--\n## Inputs and Output\n\nInputs:\n'fire' = the string.\n\nW = an integer representing the width of exinguishable contiguous section per waterbomb.\n\nOutputs:\nAn integer representing the number of waterbombs it would take to extinguish all the fires in the given string.\n\nAssume all strings can be extinguished. Assume all inputs are valid and that the strings will only contain the symbols `x` or `Y`.\n-->",
