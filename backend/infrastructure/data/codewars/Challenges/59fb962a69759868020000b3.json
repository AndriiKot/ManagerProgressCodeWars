  "description": "<p>Oh no!  Tinder's emoji decryption has gone down, and they need your help!</p>\n<p>People are receiving raw code instead of the emojis the know, love and rely upon.  It's total chaos!<br>\nAnd without your help, the millenials will no longer be able to express themselves!!</p>\n<p>While the engineers sort out the issue, the PR people have created a set of stand-in emojis using common `UTF-8` characters, and they need you write a function that can help implement them.</p>\n<p><b>OH YEAH, WE'RE TAKIN' IT BACK TO 2001 GUYS!</b></p>\n<p>Below is a legend of the stand-in emojis and the codes they are associated with:</p>\n```\n[[f9.smile]]        =>     :)\n[[f9.grin]]         =>     :D\n[[f9.smiley]]       =>     =)\n[[f9.sohappy]]      =>     XD\n[[f9.tongue]]       =>     :P\n[[f9.wink]]         =>     ;)\n[[f9.sad]]          =>     :(\n[[f9.slant]]        =>     :/\n[[f9.surprised]]    =>     :O\n[[f9.catface]]      =>     :3\n[[f9.cool]]         =>     B)\n[[f9.unimpressed]]  =>     :|\n[[f9.angry]]        =>     >:|\n[[f9.kissing]]      =>     ^.^\n[[f9.dazed]]        =>     *_*\n[[f9.dance1]]       =>     <(^.^<)\n[[f9.dance2]]       =>     (>^.^)>\n[[f9.heart]]        =>     <3\n```\n<h3>Input:</h3>\n<p>Your function will be passed a string representing a single message containing any number and variety of the above emoji codes:</p>\n```javascript\nlet input = 'Hey [[f9.kissing]]!  Sorry I think I had one too many last night... [[f9.dazed]]'\n```\n<h3>Output:</h3>\n<p>Your function must output a new string with the codes removed and the stand-in emojis in their place:</p>\n```javascript\nlet output = 'Hey ^.^!  Sorry I think I had one too many last night... *_*'\n```\n\nNote: The input strings must not be modified, as they are archived in raw form.  Other than substituting in the new emojis, the strings' data mustn't be otherwise modified.<br>\nHave fun!\n",
