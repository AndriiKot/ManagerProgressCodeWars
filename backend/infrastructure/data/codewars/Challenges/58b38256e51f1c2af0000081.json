  "description": "# Task\n\n\"AL-AHLY\" and \"Zamalek\" are the best teams in Egypt, but \"AL-AHLY\" always wins the matches between them. \"Zamalek\" managers want to know what is the best match they've played so far.\n \nThe best match is the match they lost with the minimum goal difference. If there is more than one match with the same difference, choose the one \"Zamalek\" scored more goals in.\n \nGiven the information about all matches they played, return the `index` of the best match (`0-based`). If more than one valid result, return the smallest index.\n\n# Example\n\nFor `ALAHLYGoals = [6,4] and zamalekGoals = [1,2]`, the output should be 1 (2 in COBOL).\n\nBecause `4 - 2` is less than `6 - 1`\n\nFor `ALAHLYGoals = [1,2,3,4,5] and zamalekGoals = [0,1,2,3,4]`, the output should be 4.\n\nThe goal difference of all matches are 1, but at 4<sup>th</sup> match \"Zamalek\" scored more goals in. So the result is 4 (5 in COBOL).\n\n# Input/Output\n\n -  `[input]` integer array `ALAHLYGoals`  \n  The number of goals \"AL-AHLY\" scored in each match.\n\n - `[input]` integer array `zamalekGoals`  \n  The number of goals \"Zamalek\" scored in each match. It is guaranteed that `zamalekGoals[i] < ALAHLYGoals[i]` for each element.\n\n - `[output]` an integer  \n  Index of the best match.\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n# Encodings\n\npurity: `LetRec`  \nnumEncoding: `Church`  \nexport constructors `nil, cons` for your `List` encoding  \n~~~",
