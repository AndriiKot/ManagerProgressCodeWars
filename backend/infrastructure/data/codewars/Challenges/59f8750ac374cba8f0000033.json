  "description": "Consider an array that has no prime numbers, and none of its elements has any prime digit. It would start with: `[1,4,6,8,9,10,14,16,18,40,44..]`. \n\n`12` and `15` are not in the list because `2` and `5` are primes.\n\nYou will be given an integer `n` and your task will be return the number at that index in the array. \nFor example:\n```\nsolve(0) = 1\nsolve(2) = 6\n``` \n\nMore examples in the test cases.\n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you like Prime Katas, you will enjoy this Kata: [Simple Prime Streaming](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a908da30025e995880000e3)",
