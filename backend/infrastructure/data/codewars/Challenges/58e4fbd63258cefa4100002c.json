  "description": "You love pizza, but you also love getting bang for your buck. One thing that irks you when you go to your local pizza place is that although they list the diameter and price of each pizza, they don't list the cost per square inch. (Unbelievable, I know!)\n\nWrite a function that takes two arguments - diameter, in inches, and price - and returns the price per square inch to two decimal places. (as a number, not a string)\n\n```javascript\nfunction pizzaPrice (diameter, price) {\n  // ... your code\n}\n\npizzaPrice(7, 4.30) // should return 0.11\n```\n\n```C#\npublic class Kata\n{\n  public static double PizzaPriceCheck(object diameter, object price)\n  {\n     // ... your code\n  }\n}\n\nKata.PizzaPriceCheck(7, 4.30) // should return 0.11\n```\n\nAssume that the pizza is a circular pizza of uniform diameter, and use Math.PI as the value of pi.\n\nIf you are given too few arguments, or if they aren't numbers, then return 0.\nIn C# you will be given only numbers.",
