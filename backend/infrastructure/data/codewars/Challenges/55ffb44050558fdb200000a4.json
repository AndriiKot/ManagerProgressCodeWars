  "description": "We have the first value of a certain sequence, we'll name it **`init_val`** (or **`initVal`**) (≤ 30,000).\n\nWe also define a **pattern list**, **`pattern_l`** (**`patternL`**), which consists of a repeating cycle of differences between consecutive terms in the sequence. The list has a maximum length of **6 values**, and each value in the list is ≤ 55.\n\nThe sequence is constructed as follows:  \n\n- **First term**: `init_val`  \n- **Second term**: `term2 = term1 + pattern_l[0]`  \n- **Third term**: `term3 = term2 + pattern_l[1]`  \n- **Fourth term**: `term4 = term3 + pattern_l[2]`  \n- …  \n- Once all elements of `pattern_l` are used, we cycle back to the first element and continue the pattern indefinitely.  \n\n### Example Sequence Construction:\nFor  \n- `init_val = 10`  \n- `pattern_l = [2, 1, 3]`  \n\nThe sequence will be:  \n```\nterm1 = 10  \nterm2 = 12  (10 + 2)  \nterm3 = 13  (12 + 1)  \nterm4 = 16  (13 + 3)  \nterm5 = 18  (16 + 2)  \nterm6 = 19  (18 + 1)  \nterm7 = 22  (19 + 3)  \nterm8 = 24  (22 + 2)  \n...\n```\nThis pattern continues indefinitely.\n\nWe can easily obtain the next terms of the sequence following the values in the pattern list.\nWe see that the sixth term of the sequence, ```19```, has the sum of its digits ```10```.\n\nMake a function that receives three arguments in this order:\n\n- `init_val` (`initVal`) is the starting number;\n- `pattern_l` (`patternL`) is the list of repeating differences;\n- `nth_term` (`nthTerm`) is the ordinal position of the term in the sequence (≤ 1,500,000).  \n\nThe function should return the sum of the digits of the **`nth_term`** in the sequence.  \n\n### Example Cases:\n\n```\nsum_dig_nth_term(10, [2, 1, 3], 6) → 10  \n# 6th term = 19 → sum of digits = 1 + 9 = 10  \n\nsum_dig_nth_term(10, [1, 2, 3], 15) → 10  \n# 15th term = 37 → sum of digits = 3 + 7 = 10  \n```\n\nEnjoy it and happy coding!!",
