  "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. There are `$n (1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18}) $` cards on the table. The aim of the game is to collect the most cards. The rules:\n\n* if the number of cards is *even*, the player can either take half of the cards from the stack, or only 1 card -- as they choose;\n* if the number of cards is *odd*, the player must take 1 card.\n\nAlice starts the game.\n\nReturn the maximum number of cards Alice can collect, if Bob plays optimally (tries to get as many cards as possible for himself).\n\n## Example\n\nWhen there are `10` cards, Alice can collect maximum `8`, like this:\n\n```\n1. Alice takes half of the 10 cards     (now has: 5)          -->  5 cards left\n2. Bob must take 1 card                 (now has: 1)          -->  4 cards left\n3. Alice takes half of the 4 cards      (now has: 5 + 2 = 7)  -->  2 cards left\n4. Bob takes 1 (or half of the 2 cards) (now has: 1 + 1 = 2)  -->  1 card left\n5. Alice takes the last card            (now has: 7 + 1 = 8)  -->  game over!\n\nThus, Alice has 8 cards and Bob has 2\n```",
