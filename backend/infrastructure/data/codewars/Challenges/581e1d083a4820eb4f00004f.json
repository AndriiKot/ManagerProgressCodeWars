  "description": "# MOD 256 without the MOD operator\n\nThe MOD-operator % (aka mod/modulus/remainder):\n```\nReturns the remainder of a division operation.\nThe sign of the result is the same as the sign of the first operand.\n(Different behavior in Python!)\n```\n\nThe short unbelievable mad story for this kata:<br>\nI wrote a program and needed the remainder of the division by 256. And then it happened: The \"5\"/\"%\"-Key did not react. It must be broken! So I needed a way to:\n```\nCalculate the remainder of the division by 256 without the %-operator.\n```\n\nAlso here some examples:\n```\nInput 254  -> Result 254\nInput 256  -> Result 0\nInput 258  -> Result 2 \nInput -258 -> Result -2 (in Python: Result: 254!)\n```\nIt is always expected the behavior of the MOD-Operator of the language!\n\nThe input number will always between -10000 and 10000.\n\nFor some languages the %-operator will be blocked. If it is not blocked and you know how to block it, tell me and I will include it.\n\nFor all, who say, this would be a duplicate: No, this is no duplicate! There are two katas, in that you have to write a general method for MOD without %. But this kata is only for MOD 256. And so you can create also other specialized solutions. ;-)\n\nOf course you can use the digit \"5\" in your solution. :-)\n\nI'm very curious for your solutions and the way you solve it. I found several interesting \"funny\" ways.\n\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) \n\nI have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!",
