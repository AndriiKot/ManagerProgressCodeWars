  "description": "<h2>Oh no!</h1>\n\n<h3>We made a log in system on Codewars but people have been putting random passwords to log in!</h3>\n\n<h2>Your goal for this kata:</h2>\n\n<h3>You must make sure all the passwords are valid, there will be two functions: signIn() and logIn(). signIn(<password>) will make a new password. logIn(<password>) will make sure that the password given is valid.</h3>\n\n<h2>Example:</h2>\n\n```\n// Let us say that someone signed in to codewars and their password is \"cracker\".\n// NOTE: The password will ONLY be a string.\nsignIn(\"cracker\");\n\n// Now when that someone does logIn(\"cracker\") it should return true.\nlogIn(\"cracker\");\n\nvar logIn = function() {\n  // code\n  return true;\n}\n\n// But if that someone does another password it should return false.\nlogIn(\"goat\");\n\nvar logIn = function() {\n  // code\n  return false;\n}\n```\n\nHave fun!",
