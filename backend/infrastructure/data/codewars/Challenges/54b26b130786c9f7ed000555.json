  "description": "Django is a famous back-end framework written in Python. It has a vast list of features including the creation of database tables through \"models\". You can see an example of such model below:\n\n```\nclass Person(models.Model):\n    first_name = models.CharField()\n    last_name = models.CharField()\n```\n\nApart from creating a table it can perform validation, generate HTML forms, and so on. This is possible thanks to metaclasses. Normally there are better solutions than using metaclasses, but they can be of great help in creating powerful framework interfaces. This goal of this kata is to learn and understand how such frameworks works.\n\nYour task is to implement a class `Model` and classes for its fields to support functionality like in the following example:\n\n```\nclass User(Model):\n    first_name = CharField(max_length=30)\n    last_name = CharField(max_length=50)\n    email = EmailField()\n    is_verified = BooleanField(default=False)\n    date_joined = DateTimeField(auto_now=True)\n    age = IntegerField(min_value=5, max_value=120, blank=True)\n\n\nuser1 = User(first_name='Liam', last_name='Smith', email='liam@example.com')\nuser1.validate()\n\nprint(user1.date_joined)  # prints date and time when the instance was created\nprint(user1.is_verified)  # prints False (default value)\n\nuser1.age = 256\nuser1.validate()  # raises ValidationError - age is out of range\n\nuser2 = User()\nuser2.validate()  # raises ValidationError - first three fields are missing and mandatory\n```\n\nThe classes which inherit from `Model` should:\n\n* support creation of fields using class-attribute syntax\n* have a `validate` method which checks whether all fields are valid\n\n\nThe field types you should implement are described below. Each of them also has parameters `blank` (default `False`), which determines whether `None` is allowed as a value, and `default` (default `None`) which determines the value to be used if nothing was provided at instantiation time of the Model.\n\n* `CharField` - a string with `min_length` (default `0`) and `max_length` (default `None`) parameters, both inclusive if defined\n* `IntegerField` - an integer with `min_value` (default `None`) and `max_value` (default `None`) parameters, both inclusive if defined\n* `BooleanField` - a boolean\n* `DateTimeField` - a datetime with an extra parameter `auto_now` (default `False`). If `auto_now` is `True` and no default value has been provided, the current datetime should be used automatically at Model instantion time.\n* `EmailField` - a string in the format of `address@subdomain.domain` where `address`, `subdomain`, and `domain` are sequences of alphabetical characters with `min_length` (default `0`) and `max_length` (default `None`) parameters\n\nEach field type should have its own `validate` method which checks whether the provided value has the correct type and satisfies the length/value constraints.\n",
