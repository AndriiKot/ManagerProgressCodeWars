  "description": "**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students**\n\nCreate a function, called insurance(), that computes the cost of renting a car. The function takes 3 arguments: the age of the renter, the size of the car, and the number days for the rental. The function should return an integer number of the calculated total cost of the rental.\n\nAge (integer) :\nThere is a daily charge of $10 if the driver is under 25\n\nCar Size (string) :\nThere may be an additional daily charge based on the car size:\n\ncar size      \t\tsurcharge\n\"economy\"             $0 \n\"medium\"             $10\n\"full-size\"          $15\n\nRental Days (integer) :\nThere is a base daily charge of $50 for renting a car.\nSimply multiply the one day cost by the number of days the car is rented in order to get the full cost.\n\nNote:\nNegative rental days should return 0 cost.\nAny other car size NOT listed should come with a same surcharge as the \"full-size\", $15.\n\n```javascript\ninsurance(18, \"medium\", 7); // => 490\ninsurance(30,\"full-size\",30); // => 1950\ninsurance(21,\"economy\",-10); // => 0\ninsurance(42,\"my custom car\",7); // => 455\n```\n",
