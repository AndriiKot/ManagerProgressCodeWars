  "description": "When you sign up for an account somewhere, some websites do not actually store your password in their databases.  Instead, they will transform your password into something else using a cryptographic hashing algorithm.\n\nAfter the password is transformed, it is then called a *password hash*.  Whenever you try to login, the website will transform the password you tried using the same hashing algorithm and simply see if the password hashes are the same.\n\n-----\n\nCreate the function that converts a given string into an `md5` hash.  The return value should be encoded in `hexadecimal`.\n\n```if:javascript\nRemember that you can include the builtin `require()` function to include external modules (you're not expected to implement MD5 hash algorithm yourself, there are many modules that can do that for you).\n\nIf you're not familiar with modules, see [this kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/541db50c259d9c55c00007b9).\n\nNodeJS documentation [here](https://nodejs.org/api/).\n```\n\n## Code Examples\n```\npassHash(\"password\") // --> \"5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99\"\npassHash(\"abc123\") // --> \"e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03\"\n```\nIf you want to externally test a string, [look at this website](http://www.md5hasher.net/).\n\n\n-----\nAs a side note, `md5` can be exploited, so never use it for anything secure.  The reason I used it in this kata is simply because it is a very common hashing algorithm and many people will recognize the name.",
