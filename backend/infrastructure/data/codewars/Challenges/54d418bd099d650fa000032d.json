  "description": "----\nVampire Numbers\n----\n\nOur loose definition of [Vampire Numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_number) can be described as follows:\n\n```python\n6 * 21 = 126\n# 6 and 21 would be valid 'fangs' for a vampire number as the \n# digits 6, 1, and 2 are present in both the product and multiplicands\n\n10 * 11 = 110\n# 110 is not a vampire number since there are three 1's in the\n# multiplicands, but only two 1's in the product\n```\n\nCreate a function that can receive two 'fangs' and determine if the product of the two is a valid vampire number.\n",
