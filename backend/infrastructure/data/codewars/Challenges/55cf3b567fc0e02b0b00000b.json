  "description": "From wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)> \n\nIn number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer n, also called an integer partition, \nis a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. \nTwo sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the **same** partition.\n\nFor example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:\n\n`4, 3 + 1, 2 + 2, 2 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1`.\n\nWe can write:\n\n`enum(4) -> [[4],[3,1],[2,2],[2,1,1],[1,1,1,1]]` and\n\n`enum(5) -> [[5],[4,1],[3,2],[3,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]`.\n\nThe number of parts in a partition grows very fast.\nFor n = 50 number of parts is `204226`, for 80 it is `15,796,476`\nIt would be too long to tests answers with arrays of such size. So our task is the following:\n\n1 - n being given (n integer, 1 <= n <= 50) calculate enum(n) ie the partition of n.\nWe will obtain something like that:  \n`enum(n) -> [[n],[n-1,1],[n-2,2],...,[1,1,...,1]]` (order of array and sub-arrays\ndoesn't matter). This part is not tested.\n\n2 - For each sub-array of enum(n) calculate its product. \nIf n = 5 we'll obtain **after removing duplicates and sorting**:\n\n`prod(5) -> [1,2,3,4,5,6]`\n\n`prod(8) -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18]`\n\nIf n = 40 prod(n) has a length of `2699` hence the tests will not verify such arrays.\nInstead our task number 3 is:\n\n3 - return the range, the average and the median of prod(n) in the following form \n(example for n = 5):\n\n`\"Range: 5 Average: 3.50 Median: 3.50\"`\n\nRange is an integer, Average and Median are float numbers rounded to two decimal \nplaces (\".2f\" in some languages).\n\n#### Notes:\n`Range` : difference between the highest and lowest values. \n\n`Mean or Average` : To calculate mean, add together all of the numbers \nin a set and then divide the sum by the total count of numbers.\n\n`Median` : The median is the number separating the higher half \nof a data sample from the lower half. \n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)\n\n#### Hints:\nTry to optimize your program to avoid timing out.\n\nMemoization can be helpful but it is not mandatory for being successful.\n",
