  "description": "**Can you compute a cube as a sum?**\n\nIn this Kata, you will be given a number `n` (where `n >= 1`) and your task is to find `n` consecutive odd numbers whose sum is exactly the cube of `n`.  \n\nMathematically:\n\n```math\nn^3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \\ldots + a_n \\\\\na_2 = a_1 + 2, \\quad a_3 = a_2 + 2, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad a_n = a_{n-1} + 2 \\\\\na_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\text{ are all odds} \\\\\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nn = 3, result = [7, 9, 11], because 7 + 9 + 11 = 27, the cube of 3. Note that there are only n = 3 elements in the array.\n```\n\nWrite a function that when given `n`, will return an array of `n` consecutive odd numbers with the sum equal to the cube of n `(n*n*n)`.",
