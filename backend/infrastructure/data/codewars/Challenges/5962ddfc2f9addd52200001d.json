  "description": "Hector the hacker has stolen some information, but it is encrypted. In order to decrypt it, he needs to write a function that will generate a decryption key from the encryption key which he stole (it is in hexadecimal). To do this, he has to determine the two prime factors `P` and `Q` of the encyption key, and return the product `(P-1) * (Q-1)`.\n\n**Note:** the primes used are < 10<sup>5</sup>\n\n## Examples\n\nFor example if the encryption key is `\"47b\"`, it is 1147 in decimal. This factors to 31\\*37, so the key Hector needs is 1080 (= 30\\*36).\n\n\nMore examples:\n* input: `\"2533\"`, result: 9328 (primes: 89, 107)\n* input: `\"1ba9\"`, result: 6912 (primes: 73, 97)\n",
