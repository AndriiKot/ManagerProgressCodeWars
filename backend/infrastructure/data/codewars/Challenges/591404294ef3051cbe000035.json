  "description": "# Task\n`Triangular numbers` are defined by the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2` with `n` starting from 1. They count the number of objects that can form an equilateral triangle as shown in the picture below:\n\n![](https://i.gyazo.com/eec11cc9e17a31324338edc4eb7bb746.png)\n\nSo the sequence of triangular numbers begins as follows:\n\n`1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ....`\n\nIt is proven that the sum of squares of any two consecutive triangular numbers is equal to another triangular number.\n\nYou're given a triangular number `n`. Return `true` if it can be represented as `a sum of squares of two consecutive triangular numbers`, or `false` otherwise.\n\n\n# Input/Output\n\n`[input]` integer `n`\n\nA positive triangular number\n\n`3 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`\n\n`[output]` a boolean value\n\n`true` if it is possible to represent n as the sum of squares of two consecutive triangular numbers, and `false` otherwise.\n\n# Example\n\nFor `n = 6`, the output should be `false`.\n\nNo two squared consecutive triangular numbers add up to 6.\n\nFor `n = 45`, the output should be `true`.\n\n`3 * 3 + 6 * 6 = 9 + 36 = 45`",
