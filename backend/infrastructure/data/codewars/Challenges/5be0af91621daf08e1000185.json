  "description": "The first positive integer, `n`, with its value `4n² + 1`, being divisible by `5` and `13` is `4`. (condition 1)\n\nIt can be demonstrated that we have infinite numbers that may satisfy the above condition.\n\nIf we name **<i>a</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>**, the different terms of the sequence of numbers with this property, we define `S(n)` as:\n\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/79h926t\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/79h926t.png?2\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nWe are interested in working with numbers of this sequence from 10 to 15 digits. Could you elaborate a solution for these results?\n\nYou will be given an integer value `m`(always valid an positive) and you should output the closest value of the sequence to `m`.\n\nIf the given value `m` is in the sequence, your solution should return the same value.\n\nIn the case that there are two possible solutions: `s1` and `s2`, (`s1 < s2`), because `|m - s1| = |m - s2|`, output the highest solution `s2`\n\nNo hardcoded solutions are allowed.\n\nNo misterious formulae are required, just good observation to discover hidden patterns.\n\nSee the example tests to see output format and useful examples, edge cases are included.\n\nFeatures of the random tests\n`1000 <= m <= 5.2 e14`\n\n**Note** <i>Sierpinsky presented the numbers that satisfy condition (1)</i>\n",
