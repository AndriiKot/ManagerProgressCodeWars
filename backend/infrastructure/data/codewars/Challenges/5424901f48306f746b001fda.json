  "description": "Create a method called `wait_on_threads` that accepts an array of [threads](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Thread.html) (can be empty) and waits until **all** of them finish. For example:\n\n```ruby\nthread1 = Thread.new do\n  # do somethng\nend\nthread2 = Thread.new do\n  # do somethng else\nend\n\nwait_on_threads( [thread1,thread2] )\n# Should wait inside the method until both thread1 and thread2 \n# finish whatever they were doing and exit. \n```\n\nYou can read more about threads in wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing) \n",
