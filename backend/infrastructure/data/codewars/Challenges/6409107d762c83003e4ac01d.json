  "description": "# Darwin's animals registry\n\n![Charles Darwin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikiversity/en/a/a5/Charles-darwin.jpg)\n\nWe are in 1835 on board the Beagle near the Galapagos Islands, the professor Charles Darwin that we follow makes extraordinary discoveries that seem to occupy all his mind.\n\nHe entrusted us with the mission of completing his animal register, a revolutionary idea to classify animals and improve the sharing of knowledge.\n\nOur task has been started by the great biologist and he has integrated elements that we cannot change, in a mysterious note he writes us:\n\n## *My work here draws me in and I don't have the time to devote to my project*\n## *Please finish the AnimalsRegistry implementation*\n\n### *This environment comes with an animal class already provided, you will have to deal with it!*\n\n```ruby\nclass Animal\n  attr_accessor :name, :species, :habitat, :domesticated\n\n  def initialize(name, species, habitat, domesticated, registry)\n    @name = name\n    @species = species\n    @habitat = habitat\n    @domesticated = domesticated\n    registry.all << self\n  end\nend\n```\n\nGood luck and remember, scientific knowledge depends on you!\n\n\n\n",
