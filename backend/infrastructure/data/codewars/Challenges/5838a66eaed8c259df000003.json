  "description": "An array is given with palindromic and non-palindromic numbers. A *palindromic* number is a number that is the same from a reversed order. For example `122` is not a palindromic number, but `202` is one. \n\nYour task is to write a function that returns an array  with  only `1`s and `0`s, where  all  palindromic numbers are replaced with  a `1` and all non-palindromic  numbers  are replaced  with a `0`.\n\n\nFor  example:\n\n```\n[101, 2, 85, 33, 14014]  ==>  [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n[45, 21, 303, 56]        ==>  [0, 0, 1, 0]\n```",
