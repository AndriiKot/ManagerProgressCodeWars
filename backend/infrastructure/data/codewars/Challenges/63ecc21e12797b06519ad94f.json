  "description": "# The area between the vertex of the parabola and x-axis\n## 1-) Warning\nIf you don't know about the following topics, you will have problems in this kata.\n\n- _Quadratic equations_\n- _Parabola_\n- _Integral_\n\n## 2-) Explanation\n\n\n- I will give you 3 values as input in the kata.\nThese are a , b , c. The value of a will never be given as 0.\nThese values are the coefficients of the following equation. \n```math\nf(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\n```\n- The graph of this equation is a parabola.\n\n\n- This kata asks you for the area between the vertex of the parabola and x-axis.\n\n- Don't forget area isn't negative. \n\n## 3-) Details\n\n\n- If the equation hasn't real roots, you should return 0. \nBecause there isn't any area.\n\n- If the equation has 2 equal real roots, you should return 0. Because 0 is the real area.\n- If the equation has 2 unequal real root, you should return the real area. \n\n  For example\n  ```\n  The real area: 35.265720  --->  return 35.265720\n  ```\n- Given values is definitely between -4000 with 4000. Because the result should be under the DOUBLE_MAX value. \n- I set up the tolerance to 10<sup>-6</sup> for the decimal errors.\n\n\n## _Letter for you_\n\n__If you like this kata, don't forget to vote please. Take easy...__\n\n# -founded by theprotagonist\n\n\n\n\n\n",
