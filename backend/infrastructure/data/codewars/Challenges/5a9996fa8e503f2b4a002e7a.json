  "description": "For \"x\", determine how many positive integers less than or equal to \"x\" are odd but not prime. Assume \"x\" is an integer between 1 and 10000.\n\nExample: 5 has three odd numbers (1,3,5) and only the number 1 is not prime, so the answer is 1\n\nExample: 10 has five odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9) and only 1 and 9 are not prime, so the answer is 2",
