  "description": "Sacrebleu!\n\nFrench can be pretty hard to master, and it might take you quite a while if you want to learn it from scratch...\n\nFortunately, we come to the rescue with this kata, and you will soon be able to translate anything into French.\n\n\nFrench often use the words \"Baguette\" (in reference to their marvelous bread: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baguette). Moreover, they like to shout \"Encore, encore!\" at the end of an _accordeon_ concert. Here we will shout \"Encore!\" at the end of our sentence.\n\nIn this kata, our i_speak_french method will translate any sentence argument into its French translation : \n\n- Every word from the sentence must be translated into \"Baguette\" (if it is the begining of the sentence), or \"baguette\" otherwise.\n\n- Every sentence must end by an \"Encore!\" exclamation. A sentence is ended by a final dot (\".\"), or by the end of the string argument.\n\nYou will expect a string as argument, no non-alphabetical values will be used.\n",
