  "description": "This kata was seen in programming competitions with a wide range of variations.\nA strict bouncy array of numbers, of length three or longer, is an array that each term (neither the first nor the last element) is strictly higher or lower than its neighbours.\n\nFor example, the array:\n```\narr = [7,9,6,10,5,11,10,12,13,4,2,5,1,6,4,8] (length = 16)\n```\nThe two longest bouncy subarrays of arr are\n```\n[7,9,6,10,5,11,10,12] (length = 8) and [4,2,5,1,6,4,8] (length = 7)\n```\nAccording to the given definition, the arrays ```[8,1,4,6,7]```, ```[1,2,2,1,4,5]```, are not bouncy.\n\nFor the special case of length 2 arrays, we will consider them strict bouncy if the two elements are different.\n\nThe arrays ```[-1,4]``` and ```[0,-10]``` are both  bouncy, while ```[0,0]``` is not.\n\nAn array of length 1 will be considered strict bouncy itself.\n\nYou will be given an array of integers and you should output the longest strict bouncy subarray.\n\nIn the case of having more than one bouncy subarray of same length, it should be output the subarray with its first term of lowest index in the original array.\n\nLet's see the result for the first given example.\n```\narr = [7,9,6,10,5,11,10,12,13,4,2,5,1,6,4,8]\nlongest_bouncy_list(arr) === [7,9,6,10,5,11,10,12] \n```\nSee more examples in the example tests box.\n\nFeatures of the random tests\n```\nlength of the array inputs up to 1000\n-500 <= arr[i] <= 500\n```\nEnjoy it!\n\n",
