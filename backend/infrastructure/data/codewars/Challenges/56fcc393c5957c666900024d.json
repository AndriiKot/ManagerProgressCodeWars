  "description": "A squared string has n lines, each substring being n characters long: For example:\n\n`s = \"abcd\\nefgh\\nijkl\\nmnop\"` is a squared string of size `4`.\n\nWe will use squared strings to code and decode texts. To make things easier\nwe suppose that our original text doesn't include the character '\\n'.\n\n#### Coding\nInput: \n\n - a text `t` of length `l`. \n - Consider the smallest integer `n` such that `n * n` be greater or equal to `l`.\n - Complete `t` with the char of ascii code `11` (we suppose that this char is not in our original text) until the length of `t` is `n * n`. \n - From now on we can transform the new `t` in a squared string `s` of size `n` by inserting `'\\n'` where needed.\n - Apply a clockwise rotation of 90 degrees to `s`: that's it for the coding part.\n\n#### Decoding\nInput: \n\n- a squared string `s` resulting from the coding\n- Apply a counter-clockwise rotation of 90 degrees to `s`\n- Do some cleaning to have the original text `t`\n\n\nYou can see clockwise rotation of 90 degrees: \n<http://www.codewars.com/kata/56dbeec613c2f63be4000be6>\nYou can see counter-clockwise rotation of 90 degrees: <http://www.codewars.com/kata/56dbf59b0a10feb08c000227>\n\n#### Example:\n\nt = \"I.was.going.fishing.that.morning.at.ten.o'clock\"\n\ncode(t) -> `\"c.nhsoI\\nltiahi.\\noentinw\\ncng.nga\\nk..mg.s\\n\\voao.f.\\n\\v'trtig\"`\n\ndecode(code(t)) == `\"I.was.going.fishing.that.morning.at.ten.o'clock\"`\n\n(Dots indicate spaces since they are quite invisible).\n\n#### Notes:\n\n- Swift : character `11` is replaced by `\"\\u{F7}\"` (ie `\"÷\"` - `alt 246` -)\n- Ocaml : character `11` is replaced by '&'\n- Perl : character `11` is replaced by '&'\n\n\n- Fortran: Your returned string for both functions are **not** permitted to contain *redundant* leading/trailing whitespace.  In return, you *may* safely assume that all input strings passed into your function(s) will *not* contain **redundant** leading/trailing whitespace, i.e. you do not and should **not** trim the input string before operating on it\n\n- Don't use this coding to keep your secrets:-)",
