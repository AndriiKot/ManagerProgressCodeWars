  "description": "You start working for a fancy new startup hoping to revolutionize social networking! *GASP!* They had this great idea that users should be able to specify relevant keywords to their posts using an ingenious idea by prefixing those keywords with the pound sign (#). Your job is to extract those keywords so that they can be used later on for whatever purposes. \n\n**Note:** \n\n* Pound signs alone do not count, for example: the string \"#\" would return an empty array.\n* If a word is preceded by more than one hashtag, only the last hashtag counts (e.g. \"##alot\" would return [\"alot\"])\n* Hashtags cannot be within the middle of a word (e.g. \"in#line hashtag\" returns an empty array)\n* Hashtags must precede alphabetical characters (e.g. \"#120398\" or \"#?\" are invalid)\n \n\n**Input:** String of words, where some words may contain a hashtag.\n\n**Output:** Array of strings that were prefixed with the hashtag, but do not contain the hashtag.",
