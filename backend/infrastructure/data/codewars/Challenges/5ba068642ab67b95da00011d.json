  "description": "# Your Task\nYou have a Petri dish with bacteria, and you are preparing to dive into the harsh micro-world. But, unfortunately, you don't have any microscope nearby, so you can't watch them.\n\nYou know that you have `n` bacteria in the Petri dish and size of the i-th bacteria is bacteria<sub>i</sub>. Also you know intergalactic positive integer constant `K`.\n\nThe i-th bacteria can swallow the j-th bacteria if and only if bacteria<sub>i</sub> > bacteria<sub>j</sub> and bacteria<sub>i</sub> ≤ bacteria<sub>j</sub> + K. The j-th bacteria disappear, but the i-th bacteria doesn't change its size.\n\nSince you don't have a microscope, you can only guess the minimal possible number of bacteria that will remain in your Petri dish when you finally find a microscope.\n\n```cpp\nmicroWorld({101, 53, 42, 102, 101, 55, 54} , 1) == 3\nmicroWorld({20, 15, 10, 15, 20, 25} , 5) == 1\n```\n```python\nmicro_world([101, 53, 42, 102, 101, 55, 54], 1) == 3\nmicro_world([20, 15, 10, 15, 20, 25], 5) == 1\n```\n```ruby\nmicro_world([101, 53, 42, 102, 101, 55, 54], 1) == 3\nmicro_world([20, 15, 10, 15, 20, 25], 5) == 1\n```\n```javascript\nmicroWorld([101, 53, 42, 102, 101, 55, 54], 1) === 3\nmicroWorld([20, 15, 10, 15, 20, 25], 5) === 1\n```\n\n___\n\n# Explanation\n```cpp\nbacteria = {101, 53, 42, 102, 101, 55, 54}\nK = 1\n```\n```python\nbacteria = [101, 53, 42, 102, 101, 55, 54]\nK = 1\n```\n```ruby\nbacteria = [101, 53, 42, 102, 101, 55, 54]\nK = 1\n```\n```javascript\nbacteria = [101, 53, 42, 102, 101, 55, 54]\nK = 1\n```\n\n```if:cpp\nThe one of possible sequences of swallows is: {101,53,42,102,<s>101</s>,55,54} → {101,<s>53</s>,42,102,55,54} → {<s>101</s>,42,102,55,54} → {42,102,55,<s>54</s>} → {42,102,55}. In total there are 3 bacteria remaining.\n```\n```if:python,ruby,javascript\nThe one of possible sequences of swallows is: [101,53,42,102,<s>101</s>,55,54] → [101,<s>53</s>,42,102,55,54] → [<s>101</s>,42,102,55,54] → [42,102,55,<s>54</s>] → [42,102,55].
