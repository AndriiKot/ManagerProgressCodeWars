  "description": "## Task\n\nGive you two strings: ```s1``` and ```s2```. If they are opposite, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`. Note: The result should be a boolean value, instead of a string.\n\nThe ```opposite``` means: All letters of the two strings are the same, but the case is opposite. you can assume that the string only contains letters or it's a empty string.  Also take note of the edge case - if both strings are empty then you should return `false`/`False`.\n  \n## Examples (input -> output)\n\n```\n\"ab\",\"AB\"     -> true\n\"aB\",\"Ab\"     -> true\n\"aBcd\",\"AbCD\" -> true\n\"AB\",\"Ab\"     -> false\n\"\",\"\"         -> false\n```\n",
