  "description": "You are the \"computer expert\" of a local Athletic Association (C.A.A.).\nMany teams of runners come to compete. Each time you get a string of \nall race results of every team who has run.\nFor example here is a string showing the individual results of a team of 5 runners:\n\n` \"01|15|59, 1|47|6, 01|17|20, 1|32|34, 2|3|17\" `\n\nEach part of the string is of the form: ` h|m|s `\nwhere h, m, s (h for hour, m for minutes, s for seconds) are positive or null integer (represented as strings) with one or two digits. Substrings in the input string are separated by `, ` or `,`.\n\nTo compare the results of the teams you are asked for giving\nthree statistics; **range, average and median**.\n\n- `Range` : difference between the lowest and highest values. \nIn {4, 6, 9, 3, 7} the lowest value is 3, and the highest is 9, \nso the range is 9 − 3 = 6.\n\n- `Mean or Average` : To calculate mean, add together all of the numbers \nand then divide the sum by the total count of numbers.\n\n- `Median` : In statistics, the median is the number separating the higher half \nof a data sample from the lower half. \nThe median of a finite list of numbers can be found by arranging all \nthe observations from lowest value to highest value and picking the middle one \n(e.g., the median of {3, 3, 5, 9, 11} is 5) when there is an odd number of observations. \nIf there is an even number of observations, then there is no single middle value; \nthe median is then defined to be the mean of the two middle values\n(the median of {3, 5, 6, 9} is (5 + 6) / 2 = 5.5).\n\nYour task is to return a string giving these 3 values.  For the example given above,\nthe string result will be\n\n`\"Range: 00|47|18 Average: 01|35|15 Median: 01|32|34\"`\n\nof the form:\n \"Range: hh|mm|ss Average: hh|mm|ss Median: hh|mm|ss\"`\n\nwhere hh, mm, ss are integers (represented by strings) with *each 2 digits*.\n\n#### *Remarks*: \n\n1. if a result in seconds is ab.xy... it will be given **truncated** as ab.\n2. if the given string is \"\" you will return \"\"\n",
