  "description": "Write a function called `sumIntervals`/`sum_intervals` that accepts an array of intervals, and returns the sum of all the interval lengths. Overlapping intervals should only be counted once.\n\n### Intervals\n\nIntervals are represented by a pair of integers in the form of an array. The first value of the interval will always be less than the second value. Interval example: `[1, 5]` is an interval from `1` to `5`. The length of this interval is `4`.\n\n### Overlapping Intervals\n\nList containing overlapping intervals:\n\n```c -- actual language id doesn't matter -- just want syntax highlighting\n[\n   [1, 4],\n   [7, 10],\n   [3, 5]\n]\n```\n\nThe sum of the lengths of these intervals is `7`. Since `[1, 4]` and `[3, 5]` overlap, we can treat the interval as `[1, 5]`, which has a length of `4`.\n\n### Examples:\n\n```c -- idem\nsumIntervals( [\n   [1, 2],\n   [6, 10],\n   [11, 15]\n] ) => 9\n\nsumIntervals( [\n   [1, 4],\n   [7, 10],\n   [3, 5]\n] ) => 7\n\nsumIntervals( [\n   [1, 5],\n   [10, 20],\n   [1, 6],\n   [16, 19],\n   [5, 11]\n] ) => 19\n\nsumIntervals( [\n   [0, 20],\n   [-100000000, 10],\n   [30, 40]\n] ) => 100000030\n```\n\n### Tests with large intervals\n\nYour algorithm should be able to handle large intervals. All tested intervals are subsets of the range `[-1000000000, 1000000000]`.\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n### Encodings\n\npurity: `LetRec`  \nnumEncoding: `ScottBinary` ( subsets are actually in range `[0, 2000]` )  \nexport constructor `Pair` for your `Pair` encoding  \nexport constructors `nil, cons` for your `List` encoding  \n~~~\n",
