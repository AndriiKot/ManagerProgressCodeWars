  "description": "While surfing in web I found interesting math problem called \"Always perfect\". That means if you add 1 to the product of four consecutive numbers the answer is ALWAYS a perfect square.\nFor example we have: 1,2,3,4 and the product will be 1X2X3X4=24. If we add 1 to the product that would become 25, since the result number is a perfect square the square root of 25 would be 5.\n\nSo now lets write a function which takes numbers separated by commas in string format and returns the number which is a perfect square and the square root of that number.\n\nIf string contains other characters than number or it has more or less than 4 numbers separated by comma function returns \"incorrect input\".\n\nIf string contains 4 numbers but not consecutive it returns \"not consecutive\".\n\n",
