  "description": "His Royal Highness Prince of Edinburgh cares a lot about the ecology and propagates [waste sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_sorting). Once per year, He organizes the Christmas Trash Party, where His employees sort the garbage that the Prince has been thrown during the year. Obviously, you want to participate in this High day.\n\n### Task\n\nYou will receive `trash1` and `trash2`, that might be the next values:\n\n```if:javascript\n ```[], false, '', new Array(), null, NaN, undefined, 0, -0, 0n, -0n, '0'```\n```\n```if:php\n ```[], false, true, '', array(), null, 0, '0', 1, '1', -1, '-1', 'trash' ```\n```\nYou have to return a boolean if they are **strictly equal**.\n\n### However\n\nThe Prince says when He was young, there weren't softies who were afraid to get their hands dirty, so He doesn't let His employees use gloves for work (triple equals `===` and strict inequality `!==` are **not allowed**).\n\n### These links might help: \n```if:javascript\n* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness\n* https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs\n```\n```if:php\n* https://www.php.net/manual/en/types.comparisons.php\n* https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/819645/Pitfalls-of-PHPs-Comparison-Operators-When-to-Us\n```\n",
