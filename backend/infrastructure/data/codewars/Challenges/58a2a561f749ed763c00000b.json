Count the number of dollars in each boot and return a string such as: \n\n\"This Rhinestone Cowboy has 2 dollar bills in his right boot and 1 in the left\"\n```\nboots[0] = left boot\nboots[1] = right boot\n```\n\nThe bill must be of form ```[(1)]``` to be counted and only count ones, no other denominations. Only count bills in the top half of the boot(boot leg) so the cowboy can pull money out without removing the boots, see diagram above.\n\nThe test boots will be well-formed and always the same size.\n\nYou will always be given two boots since a Cowboy cannot walk around barefoot!\n\nDedicated to one of the coolest dudes ever.... \nGlen Campbell\n=> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kAU3B9Pi_U",
