  "description": "You will be given a string (`x`) featuring a cat `'C'`, a dog `'D'` and a mouse `'m'`. The rest of the string will be made up of `'.'`.\n\nYou need to find out if the cat can catch the mouse from its current position. The cat can jump at most (`j`) characters, and cannot jump over the dog.\n\nSo:\n\n* if `j` = `5`:\n\n  `..C.....m...D` returns `'Caught!'`  <-- not more than `j` characters between the cat and the mouse\n\n  `.....C............m......D` returns `'Escaped!'`  <-- as there are more than `j` characters between the two, the cat cannot jump far enough\n\n* if `j` = `10`:\n\n  `...m.........C...D` returns `'Caught!'` <-- Cat can jump far enough and jump is not over dog\n\n  `...m....D....C.......` returns `'Protected!'` <-- Cat can jump far enough, but dog is in the way, protecting the mouse\n\n* Finally, if not all three animals are present, return `'boring without all three'`\n",
