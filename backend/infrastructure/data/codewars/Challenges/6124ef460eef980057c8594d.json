  "description": "You are given some positive integer num (10^11 > num > 0).\n\nTask is simple: \n- try to find out the biggest divisor of this number (not including value itself) and return it;\n- if it's a prime number, return 1.\n\nHint: you'll have some problems (12 seconds time exceeded) if not find best time complexity (must be significantly less then O(num)).\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nif num equals 12, its biggest divisor will be 6 \n(we shoul choose maximum between 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, \nbut not including the number itself, i.e. 12)\n```\n\n```\nif num equals 7, its biggest divisor will be 1, \nbecause it's a prime number \n(we shoul choose maximum between 1, 7, \nbut not including the number itself, i.e. 7)\n```",
