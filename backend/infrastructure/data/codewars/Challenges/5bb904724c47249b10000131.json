  "description": "Our football team has finished the championship.\n\nOur team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format `\"x:y\"`, where `x` is our team's score and `y` is our opponents score.\n\nFor example:\n```[\"3:1\", \"2:2\", \"0:1\", ...]```\n\nPoints are awarded for each match as follows:\n- if x > y: 3 points (win)\n- if x < y: 0 points (loss)\n- if x = y: 1 point  (tie)\n\nWe need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (`x`) got in the championship by the rules given above.\n\nNotes:\n- our team always plays 10 matches in the championship\n- 0 <= x <= 4\n- 0 <= y <= 4",
