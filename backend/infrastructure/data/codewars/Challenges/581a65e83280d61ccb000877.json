  "description": "This kata is inspired by a lecture video about domain specific languages and the ruby object model available on youtube. Watching the video is highly recommended but not necessary to complete the kata. You can find the link below.\n\nYour task is to implement a domain specific language (the recipe class) in which one can define recipes in the following manner:\n\n```ruby\nrecipe = Recipe.new('mix') do\n  ingredient \"salt\"\n  ingredient \"sugar\"\n\n  step \"mix salt & sugar\"\n  step \"throw it in the bin\"\nend\n\nputs recipe\n```\n\nand by defining the `to_s` of recipes the above program outputs:\n\n```\nmix\n===\nsalt, sugar\n\n0.) mix salt & sugar\n1.) throw it in the bin\n```\n\nThe format starts with the name of the recipe passed as an argument to `Recipe.new`. It's followed by matching number of '='s on the next line. Then the ingredients on one line, separated by commas. This is followed by an empty line and then the steps in a numbered list.\n\n\nlecture link: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D9wwPniszY)",
