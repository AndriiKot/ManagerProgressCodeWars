  "description": "The most basic encryption method is to map a char to another char by a certain math rule.\nBecause every char has an ASCII value, we can manipulate this value with a simple math expression. \nFor example 'a' + 1 would give us 'b', because 'a' value is 97 and 'b' value is 98.\n\nYou will need to write a method which does exactly that - \n\nget a string as text and an int as the rule of manipulation, and should return encrypted text.\nfor example:\n\nencrypt(\"a\",1) = \"b\"\n\n *Full ascii table is used on our question (256 chars) - so 0-255 are the valid values.*\n \nIf the value exceeds 255, it should 'wrap'. ie. if the value is 345 it should wrap to 89. \n \nGood luck.",
