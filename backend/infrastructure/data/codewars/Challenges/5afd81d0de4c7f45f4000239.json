  "description": "### Description\n\nGiven a list of **integers** (possibly including duplicates) and a positive integer `k` (> 0), find the minimum and maximum possible product of `k` elements taken from the list.\n\nIf you cannot take enough elements from the list (`k` > list size), return `None`/`nil`.\n\n\n### Examples\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, -2, -3, 4, 6, 7]\n\nk = 1  ==>  -3, 7\nk = 2  ==>  -21, 42    # -3*7, 6*7\nk = 3  ==>  -126, 168  # -3*6*7, 4*6*7\nk = 7  ==>  None       # there are only 6 elements in the list\n```\n```ruby\nnumbers = [1, -2, -3, 4, 6, 7]\n\nk = 1  ==>  -3, 7\nk = 2  ==>  -21, 42    # -3*7, 6*7\nk = 3  ==>  -126, 168  # -3*6*7, 4*6*7\nk = 7  ==>  nil        # there are only 6 elements in the list\n```\n\nNote: the test lists are sufficiently small (up to 20 elements) for a simple approach.\n\n\nThere is an [advanced version](https://www.codewars.com/kata/minimum-and-maximum-product-of-k-elements-advanced) of this kata, if you're up to the challenge! :-)\n\n---\n\n### My other katas\n\nIf you enjoyed this kata then please try [my other katas](https://www.codewars.com/users/anter69/authored)! :-)\n\n#### *Translations are welcome!*",
