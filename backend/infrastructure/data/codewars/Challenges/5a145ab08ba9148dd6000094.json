  "description": "In this Kata, you will write a function `doubles` that will remove double string characters that are adjacent to each other.\n\nFor example:\n\n`doubles('abbcccdddda') = 'aca'`, because, from left to right:\n```Haskell\na) There is only one 'a' on the left hand side, so it stays.\nb) The 2 b's disappear because we are removing double characters that are adjacent. \nc) Of the 3 c's, we remove two. We are only removing doubles. \nd) The 4 d's all disappear, because we first remove the first double, and again we remove the second double.\ne) There is only one 'a' at the end, so it stays.\n```\n\nTwo more examples: `doubles('abbbzz') = 'ab'` and `doubles('abba') = \"\"`. In the second example, when we remove the b's in `'abba'`, the double `a` that results is then removed.\n\nThe strings will contain lowercase letters only. More examples in the test cases. \n\nGood luck!\n ",
