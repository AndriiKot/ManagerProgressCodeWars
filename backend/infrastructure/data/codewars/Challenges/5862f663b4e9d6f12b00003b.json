  "description": "You and a friend have decided to play a game to drill your statistical intuitions. The game works like this:\n\nYou have a bunch of red and blue marbles. To start the game you grab a handful of marbles of each color and put them into the bag, keeping track of how many of each color go in. You take turns reaching into the bag, guessing a color, and then pulling one marble out. You get a point if you guessed correctly. The trick is you only have three seconds to make your guess, so you have to think quickly.\n\nYou've decided to write a function, `guessBlue()` to help automatically calculate whether you should guess \"blue\" or \"red\". The function should take four arguments:\n\n * the number of blue marbles you put in the bag to start\n * the number of red marbles you put in the bag to start\n * the number of blue marbles pulled out so far (always lower than the starting number of blue marbles)\n * the number of red marbles pulled out so far (always lower than the starting number of red marbles)\n\n`guessBlue()` should return the probability of drawing a blue marble, expressed as a float. For example, `guessBlue(5, 5, 2, 3)` should return `0.6`.",
