  "description": "# Task\nBusinesses like to have memorable telephone numbers. One way to make a telephone number memorable is to have it spell a memorable word or phrase. \n\nFor example, you can call the University of Waterloo by dialing the memorable `TUT-GLOP`. Sometimes only part of the number is used to spell a word. When you get back to your hotel tonight you can order a pizza from Gino's by dialing `310-GINO`. \n\nThe standard form of a telephone number is seven decimal digits with a hyphen between the third and fourth digits (e.g. `888-1200`). The keypad of a phone supplies the mapping of letters to numbers, as follows:\n\n```\nA, B, and C map to 2\nD, E, and F map to 3\nG, H, and I map to 4\nJ, K, and L map to 5\nM, N, and O map to 6\nP, R, and S map to 7\nT, U, and V map to 8\nW, X, and Y map to 9\nletters can be uppercase or lowercase\n```\n\nThere is no mapping for `Q(q) or Z(z)`. Hyphens are not dialed, and can be added and removed as necessary. The standard form of `TUT-GLOP` is `888-4567`, the standard form of `310-GINO` is `310-4466`, and the standard form of `3-10-10-10` is `310-1010`.\n\nTwo telephone numbers are equivalent if they have the same standard form. (They dial the same number.)\n\nGiven a list `phoneNumbers`, your task is to find the duplicate telephone number in the list. Return an array like this:\n\n`[\"310-1010:2\",\"487-3279:4\",\"888-4567:3\"]`\n\nThe form of each element is `standard form + : + numbers of duplicate`\n\n# Input/Output\n\n- `[input]` string array `phoneNumbers`\n\nThe list of the telephone numbers. Each telephone number consists of a string composed of decimal digits, letters (excluding Q and Z) and hyphens. Exactly seven of the characters in the string will be digits or letters.\n\n- `[output]` a string array\n\nThe duplicate telephone number list. Arrange the output string by telephone number in ascending lexicographical order. If there are no duplicates in the input return `[]`.\n\n# Example\n\nFor phoneNumbers:\n\n```\n[\n\"7399425\",\n\"SEXY-GAL\",\n\"Sexy-GAL\",\n\"sexy-gal\",\n\"SEXY-425\",\n\"S-E-X-Y-G-A-L\"\n]\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n```\n[\"739-9425:6\"]\n```",
