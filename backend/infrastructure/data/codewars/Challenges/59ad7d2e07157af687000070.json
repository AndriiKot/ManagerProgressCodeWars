  "description": "Your friend Robbie has successfully created an AI that is capable of communicating in English!\n\nRobbie's almost done with the project, however the machine's output isn't working as expected. Here's a sample of a sentence that it outputs:\n\n```\n[\"this\",\"is\",\"a\",\"sentence\"]\n```\n\nEvery time that it tries to say a sentence, instead of formatting it in normal English orthography, it just outputs a list of words.\n\nRobbie has pulled multiple all-nighters to get this project finished, and he needs some beauty sleep. So, he wants you to write the last part of his code, a `sentencify` function, which takes the output that the machine gives, and formats it into proper English orthography.\n\nYour function should:\n\n1. Capitalise the first letter of the first word.\n2. Add a period (`.`) to the end of the sentence.\n3. Join the words into a complete string, with spaces.\n4. Do *no other manipulation* on the words.\n\n-----\n\nHere are a few examples of what your function should do:\n\n| Input | Output |\n| --- | --- |\n| `[\"i\", \"am\", \"an\", \"AI\"]` | `\"I am an AI.\"` |\n| `[\"FIELDS\",\"of\",\"CORN\",\"are\",\"to\",\"be\",\"sown\"]` | `\"FIELDS of CORN are to be sown.\"` |\n| `[\"i'm\",\"afraid\",\"I\",\"can't\",\"let\",\"you\",\"do\",\"that\"]` | `\"I'm afraid I can't let you do that.\"` |\n\n**_(Any translations (eg: to Java/C#/C++/Typescript) would be greatly appreciated!)_**",
