  "description": "The integer `64` is the first integer that has all of its digits even and furthermore, is a perfect square.\n\nThe second one is `400` and the third one `484`.\n\nGive the numbers of this sequence that are in the range `[a,b]` (both values inclusive)\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nEven digit squares between 100 to 1000:  [400, 484]  (the output should be sorted)\nEven digit squares between 1000 to 4000: []\n``` \n\nFeatures of the random tests:\n\n```\nnumber of tests = 167\nmaximum value for a = 1e10\nmaximum value for b = 1e12\n```\n\nYou do not have to check the entries; `a` and `b` are always positive integers and `a < b`.\n\nHappy coding!!",
