  "description": "The AB-YZ cipher...\n\nThe challenge here is merely to implement the encoding of the AB-YZ cipher. \n\nThe cipher is so named because it uses the position of the letter in the alphabet relative to the previous letter in order to encode data.\nFirst make the letters that should be encoded into a series of bytes and then iterate through every bit. For the first bit if it is 0 add the letter A to the result and if it is 1 add the letter B to the result.\nFor the second bit add the letter Y to the result if the value of the bit is 0 and otherwise add the letter Z to the result.\nThen for the third bit if the value is 0 add C to the result otherwise you should add D and so on for the rest of the input.\nWhen either end of the alphabet is reached it should loop around to the other side.\nAny values that are not a part of the alphabet should simply be passed along directly to the result.\n\nexample:\n\nabc -> bycwethsipkomlpkrhsgudxc",
