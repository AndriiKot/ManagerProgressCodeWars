  "description": "\n### Use description\nYou have a lootbox with N items. Each item has a different chance to drop and can be dropped only once. After each item drop chances need to be evenly redistributed\n\n### Actual Task\nThe actual task is to provide a function that will distribute in equal numbers provided `chances`, and round up for the top `n` items\n\nFunction receives two arguments:\n  * An array of chances\n  * A chance of a dropped item that needs to be distributed\n  \nAnd should return\n  * Redistribution Chances\n\n### Example 1\nWhen chances can be evenly distributed\n\nGiven `[20, 20, 20, 20], 20`\n\nIt should return `[25, 25, 25,25]`\n\n### Example 2\nIn another case even distribution isn't possible so most probable chance become even more probable\n\nGiven `[40, 30, 15, 5], 10`\n\nIt should return `[43, 33, 17, 7]`\n\n### Example 3\n\nWhen chances are equal and can't be evenly distributed. Follow the original order of `chances` array\n\nGiven `[22, 9, 22, 22, 9, 2], 14`\n\nIt should return `[25, 11, 25, 24, 11, 4]`",
