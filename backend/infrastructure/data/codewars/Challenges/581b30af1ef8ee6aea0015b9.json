  "description": "Create a function that takes two arguments:\n\n1) An array of objects which feature the season, the team and the country of the Champions League winner.\n\n2) Country (as a string, for example, 'Portugal')\n\nYou function should then return the number which represents the number of times a team from a given country has won. Return `0` if there have been no wins.\n\nFor example if the input array is as follows:\n\n<img src=http://i.imgur.com/61bIUDY.png>\n\n\n`countWins(winnerList1, 'Spain')` => should return 2<br>\n`countWins(winnerList1, 'Portugal')` => should return 1<br>\n`countWins(winnerList1, 'Sportland')` => should return 0<br>\n\n",
