  "description": "You've come to visit your grandma and she immediately found you a job - her Christmas tree needs decorating!\n\nShe first shows you a tree with a given number of branches, and then hands you some baubles (or loads of them!).\n\nYou know your grandma is a very particular person and that she'd like the baubles distributed in an orderly manner. You decide the best course of action would be to put the same number of baubles on each of the branches (if possible) or add one more bauble to some of the branches - starting from the beginning of the tree. \n\nIn this kata you will return an array of baubles on each of the branches.\n\nFor example: \n\n10 baubles, 2 branches: [5,5]\n5 baubles, 7 branches: [1,1,1,1,1,0,0]\n12 baubles, 5 branches: [3,3,2,2,2]\n\nThe numbers of branches and baubles will always be greater or equal to 0.\nIf there are 0 branches return: \"Grandma, we will have to buy a Christmas tree first!\".\n\nGood luck - I think your granny may have some minced pies for you if you do a good job!\n\n\n",
