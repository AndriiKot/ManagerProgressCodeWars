  "description": "Calculate the number of items in a vector that appear at the same index in each vector, with the same value. \n\n```javascript\n  ([1 2 3 4 5], [1 2 2 4 3]) => 0.6\n  ([1 2 3], [1 2 3]) => 1.0\n```\n\nAffinity value should be realized on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 being absolutely identical. Two identical sets should always be evaluated as having an affinity of 1.0.\n\nHint: The last example test case holds a significant clue to calculating the affinity correctly.\n",
