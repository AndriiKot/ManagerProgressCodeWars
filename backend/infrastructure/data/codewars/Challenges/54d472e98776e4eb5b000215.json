  "description": "In music, each note is named by its pitch class (e.g., C, E♭, F♯), and each pitch class can alternatively be expressed as an integer from 0 to 11. Your task will be to write a method called `pitch_class` (**JS**: ` pitchClass` ) that, when given a letter-based pitch class, returns the corresponding integer.\n\nOnly seven letters are used to name the notes: \"A\" through \"G.\" These letter names are cyclical, just like the days of the week. The notes corresponding to those letters are called the \"natural notes.\" Here are the numbers corresponding to each of them:\n\n* C : 0\n* D : 2\n* E : 4\n* F : 5\n* G : 7\n* A : 9\n* B : 11\n\nSo `pitch_class('D')`  (**JS**: ` pitchClass('D')` ) should return 2, and `pitch_class('B')`  (**JS**: ` pitchClass('B')` ) should return 11.\n\nThe sharp sign (\"♯\") is essentially an increment operator, so \"C♯\" (pronounced \"C sharp\") refers to one note higher than C, which has a value of 1, whereas F♯ has a value of 6. Since Codewars doesn't allow the sharp sign, we'll use a number sign (\"#\") instead.\n\nThe flat sign (\"♭\") is the opposite of a sharp, meaning one note lower. F♭ has a value of 4, and C♭ has a value of 11 (the twelve-note system is **cyclical**). Since Codewars doesn't allow the flat sign, we'll use a lowercase \"b\" instead.\n\nReturn nil  (**JS**: ` null` ) for invalid input.\n\n(Next in this series: http://www.codewars.com/kata/integer-to-musical-pitch-classes)",
