  "description": "The [Decorator Design Pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17XTOODeWQE) can be used, for example, in the StarCraft game to manage upgrades. \n\nThe pattern consists in \"incrementing\" your base class with extra functionality.\n\nA decorator will receive an instance of the base class and use it to create a new instance with the new things you want \"added on it\".\n\n## Your Task\n\nComplete the code so that when a `Marine` gets a `WeaponUpgrade` it increases the damage by `1`, and if it is a `ArmorUpgrade` then increase the armor by `1`.\n\nYou have 3 classes:\n\n  - `Marine`: has a `damage` and an `armor` properties\n  - `MarineWeaponUpgrade` and `MarineArmorUpgrade`: upgrades to apply on marine. Accepts a `Marine` in the constructor and has the same properties as the `Marine`\n\n## Resouces\n\n  - [PatternCraft > Decorator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17XTOODeWQE)\n  - [SourceMaking > Decorator](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/decorator)\n  - [Wikipedia > Decorator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern)\n\n# PatternCraft series\n\n  - [State Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-state/)\n  - [Strategy Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-strategy/)\n  - [Visitor Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-visitor/)\n  - **Decorator Pattern**\n  - [Adapter Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-adapter/)\n  - [Command Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-command/)\n\nThe original [PatternCraft series (by John Lindquist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8B19C3040F6381A2) is a collection of Youtube videos that explains some of the design patterns and how they are used (or could be) on StarCraft.
