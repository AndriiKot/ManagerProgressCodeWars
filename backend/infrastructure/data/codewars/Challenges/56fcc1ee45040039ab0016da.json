  "description": "# Fun with ES6 Classes #4 - Cubes and Setters\n\n## Overview\n\nIn [Fun with ES6 Classes #3 - Cuboids, Cubes and Getters](http://www.codewars.com/kata/56fbdda707cff41b68000de2), we learned that if we knew all the dimensions (i.e. ```length, width, height```) of a cuboid, we could easily work out its corresponding volume and surface area.  The way we achieved this in our code was by the use of **getters** which automatically computed the volume and surface area of the cuboid whenever either one of ```length, width, height``` changed.  However, in the previouos exercise, one thing we could not do is define **setters** for surface area or volume of a cuboid because for a given volume/SA, there were an infinite number of possibilities to the dimensions of the cuboid.\n\nHowever, for cubes (a special type of cuboid), since their ```length```, ```width``` and ```height``` are always the same, it is possible to figure out the side length of a cube given its surface area and/or volume.  Therefore, in this Kata, you will be asked to define **setters** as well as getters for both the surface area and volume of a cube.\n\n## Task\n\nDefine a ```class Cube``` whose constructor function takes exactly one parameter ```length``` and stores the value of the argument into ```this.length```.  You will then define **both a getter and a setter** for the ```surfaceArea``` and ```volume``` of the cube.\n\nNo initial code will be given.  You are free to use whatever syntax you like to complete this Kata but **it is highly recommended that you use ES6 syntax and features to complete this Kata**.\n\n## Articles of Interest\n\nBelow are some articles of interest that may help you complete this Kata:\n\n1.
