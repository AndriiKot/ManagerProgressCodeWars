  "description": "In genetics, a sequence’s motif is a nucleotides (or amino-acid) sequence pattern. Sequence motifs have a biological significance. For more information you can take a look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_motif).\n\n\nFor this kata you need to complete the function `motif_locator`. This function receives 2 arguments - a sequence and a motif. Both arguments are strings.\n\nYou should return an array that contains all the start positions of the motif (in order). A sequence may contain 0 or more repetitions of the given motif. Note that the number of the first position is 1, not 0.\n\n**Some examples:**\n\n- For the `sequence` \"ACGTGGGGACTAGGGG\" and the `motif` \"GGGG\" the result should be [5, 13]. \n- For the `sequence` \"ACCGTACCAAGGGACC\" and the `motif` \"AAT\"  the result should be []\n- For the `sequence` \"GGG\" and the motif \"GG\" the result should be [1, 2]\n\n**Note**: You can take a look to my others bio-info kata [here](http://www.codewars.com/users/nbeck/authored)",
