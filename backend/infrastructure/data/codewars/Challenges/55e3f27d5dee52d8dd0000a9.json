  "description": "You have an array of non-negative integers. You need to calculate the difference between the 1st biggest number and the 2nd biggest number of the array.\n\nYou can assume that the input array has `2` or more elements.\n\nThe input array has the `sort` method disabled, so you will have to solve it in another way.\n\n### Example\n\n`[10, 5, 2]`\n\nIn this case, the 1st biggest number is `10` and the 2nd biggest number is `5`. So, the function returns `5`, the result of `10 - 5`.",
