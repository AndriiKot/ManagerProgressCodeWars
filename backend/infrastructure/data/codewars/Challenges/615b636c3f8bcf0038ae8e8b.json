  "description": "Easier version: [Kingdoms Ep2: The curse (simplified)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/6159dda246a119001a7de465)\n\nYou are travelling and you see some strong villagers trying to battle unsuccessfully with one skinny man. When you approach them, the peasants tell you that man is the cursed priest from the village. Now he lives among the tombs, cries out and nobody can understand him because he can not pronounce any entire word. You decided to try to help him.\n\nGiven the string `speech` and the array `vocabulary`. You should return a string where each _word_ in the priest's `speech` is replaced with the appropriate word from `vocabulary`. After every replacement, remove the appropriate _word_ from `vocabulary`. Sometimes, it might seem unclear which word exactly is appropriate but, after reducing the size of `vocabulary`, there will be only one possible final answer.  \n\n#### Notes: \n\n- Words in the priest's speech always consist of lowercase letters and at least one asterisk. Each asterisk is replacing one character;\n- `speech` consists of these _words_, as described above, spaces and marks `?!,.` ;\n- There might be more words in `vocabulary` than `words` in speech;\n- The length of an encoded word must be the same as an appropriate word of vocabulary;\n- The minimum length of a word is 3.\n\n#### Example:\nGiven a speech `\"a**? *c*. **e,\"` and a vocabulary of `[\"ace\", \"acd\", \"abd\"]`, the expected answer is `\"abd? acd. ace,\"`.\n\n![If you don't see the image, create the issie please](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/03/11/d8/0311d835d81b01839614b5398d3c0db0.jpg)\n\n---\n\nRead the end of the story in the \"epilogue\" test.\n\n",
