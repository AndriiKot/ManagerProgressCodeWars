  "description": "The code provided has a method `hello` which is supposed to show only those attributes which have been *explicitly* set. Furthermore, it is supposed to say them in the *same order* they were set.\n\nBut it's not working properly.\n\n# Notes\n\nThere are 3 attributes\n* name \n* age\n* sex ('M' or 'F')\n\nWhen the same attribute is assigned multiple times the `hello` method shows it only once. If this happens the *order* depends on the **first** assignment of that attribute, but the *value* is from the **last** assignment.\n\n# Examples\n\n* `Hello.`\n* `Hello. My name is Bob. I am 27. I am male.`\n* `Hello. I am 27. I am male. My name is Bob.`\n* `Hello. My name is Alice. I am female.`\n* `Hello. My name is Batman.`\n\n# Task\nFix the code so we can all go home early.\n",
