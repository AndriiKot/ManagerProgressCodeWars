  "description": "Each node of a binary tree stores a nonnegative integer. The value at every non-leaf node is supposed to be the sum of its two children, but one node is incorrect. Find this node.\n\nExample: Consider the tree below. <code>13</code> is the sum of <code>6</code> and <code>7</code>, but <code>15</code> is incorrect, because <code>27 != 13 + 15</code> and <code>15 != 5 + 9</code>. Clearly the <code>15</code>should be changed to <code>14</code>.\n```   \n           27\n         /    \\\n        13    15\n       /  \\   / \\\n      6   7  5   9\n ```\n \nDetails:\n\n(1) The tree will always be <b>full</b> (all non-leaf nodes have exactly 2 children) and <b>perfect</b> (all leaves are on the bottom level).<br>\n(2) Considering the root as level 1, its children as level 2, their children as level 3, and so on,  the tree contains at least 3 levels and no more than 12.<br>\n(3) If the incorrect value occurs on the leaf level, then the **right** child is the incorrect one.<br>\n(4) The tree is provided as a list with the nodes in breath-first order. The root is element 0, its leftchild is element 1 and its rightchild is element 2; element 1's leftchild is element 3 and its rightchild is element 4; element 2's leftchild is element 5 and its rightchild is element 6, and so on. The example above is <code>[27, 13, 15, 6, 7, 5, 9]</code>.<br>\n(5) Return the index of the incorrect node and the value it should be changed to. In the example return <code>(2,14).</code> (Indexes start from 0.) <br>\n\nOther Examples: \n\n<code>[28, 13, 14, 6, 7, 5, 9] => (0,27).</code><br>\nExplanation: <code>28 != 13 + 14,</code> but checking the children of <code>13</code> and <code>14</code> shows that they are both fine. So the <code>28</code> must be changed.\n\n<code>[28, 13, 15, 6, 7, 5, 9] => (6,10).</code><br>\nExplanation: <code>15 != 5 + 9,</code> but the <code>15</code> itself is fine, because <code>28 = 13 + 15.</code> Hence one of its children is wrong, but they are leaves, so how do we tell? Detail (3) says \"If the incorrect value occurs on the leaf level, then the **right** child is the incorrect one.\"  Thus the <code>9</code> must be changed to <code>10,</code> rather than changing the <code>5</code>  to <code>6.</code>\n\nSOURCE: Programming Competition at the Midwest Instructional Computing Symposium, 2018.\n\nHarder binary tree problems:<br> \n[Complete Binary Tree](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5c80b55e95eba7650dc671ea)<br>\n[Sort binary tree by levels](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52bef5e3588c56132c0003bc)\n\n\n",
