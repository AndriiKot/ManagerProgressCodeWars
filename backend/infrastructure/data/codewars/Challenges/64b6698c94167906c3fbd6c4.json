  "description": "# Task\nThe function is given two equal size matrices of integers. Each cell holds a pixel: 1 represents a black pixel, 0 represents a white pixel. One of the images can be shifted in any two directions (up, down, left, right) relative to the other image by any number of cells, e.g. (2 up, 1 right) or (1 down, 0 left). Determine the maxim possible overlap of black pixels of the two images.\n\n# Examples\n```\nmax_overlap([[1]], [[1]]) ➞ 1\n# Each image has only one pixel.\n\nmax_overlap([[0]], [[0]]) ➞ 0\n# No pixels in any image\n\nmax_overlap([[1, 1, 0],\n             [0, 1, 0]],\n            [[0, 1, 1],\n             [0, 0, 1]]) ➞ 3\n# The first image can be shifted to the right by 1 to get 3-pixel overlap.\n\nmax_overlap([[0, 1, 0],\n             [1, 1, 0]],\n            [[0, 1, 1],\n             [0, 0, 1]]) ➞ 2\n# The first image can be shifted 1-right, 1-up to get 2-pixel overlap.\n\nmax_overlap([[1, 1],\n             [1, 1]],\n            [[0, 0],\n             [1, 1]]) ➞ 2\n# Without any shift a 2-pixel overlap is achieved and it cannot be larger.\n```\n\n# Input constraints\n- img1[n][m], img2[n][m] where 1<=n<=15, 1<=m<=15\n- Images can be of rectangle shapes",
