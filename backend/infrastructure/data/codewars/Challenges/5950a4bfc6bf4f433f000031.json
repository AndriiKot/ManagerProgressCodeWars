  "description": "# Task\n\nJohn is a programmer. He treasures his time very much. He lives on the `n` floor of a building. Every morning he will go downstairs as quickly as possible to begin his great work today.\n\nThere are two ways he goes downstairs: walking or taking the elevator.\n\nWhen John uses the elevator, he will go through the following steps:\n```\n1. Waiting the elevator from m floor to n floor;\n2. Waiting the elevator open the door and go in;\n3. Waiting the elevator close the door;\n4. Waiting the elevator down to 1 floor;\n5. Waiting the elevator open the door and go out;\n(the time of go in/go out the elevator will be ignored)\n```\n\nGiven the following arguments:\n```\nn: An integer. The floor of John(1-based).\nm: An integer. The floor of the elevator(1-based).\nspeeds: An array of integer. It contains four integer [a,b,c,d]\n        a: The seconds required when the elevator rises or falls 1 floor\n        b: The seconds required when the elevator open the door\n        c: The seconds required when the elevator close the door\n        d: The seconds required when John walks to n-1 floor\n```\n\nPlease help John to calculate the shortest time to go downstairs.\n\n\n\n\n# Example\n\nFor `n = 5, m = 6 and speeds = [1,2,3,10]`, the output should be `12`.\n\nJohn go downstairs by using the elevator:\n\n`1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 12`\n\nFor `n = 1, m = 6 and speeds = [1,2,3,10]`, the output should be `0`.\n\nJohn is already at 1 floor, so the output is `0`.\n\nFor `n = 5, m = 4 and speeds = [2,3,4,5]`, the output should be `20`.\n\nJohn go downstairs by walking:\n\n`5 x 4 = 20`\n",
