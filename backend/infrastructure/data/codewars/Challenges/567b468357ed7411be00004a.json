  "description": "In a genetic algorithm, a population is a collection of candidates that may evolve toward a better solution.\n\nWe determine how close a chromosome is to a ideal solution by calculating its fitness.\nhttps://www.codewars.com/kata/567b468357ed7411be00004a/train\nYou are given two parameters, the `population` containing all individuals and a function `fitness` that determines how close to the solution a chromosome is.\n\nYour task is to return a collection containing an object with the chromosome and the calculated fitness.\n\n```\n[\n  { chromosome: c, fitness: f },\n  { chromosome: c, fitness: f },\n  ...\n]\n```\n~~~if:csharp\nNote: you have a pre-loaded class `ChromosomeWrap` and you should return a collection of it instead.\n```csharp\npublic class ChromosomeWrap\n{\n    public string Chromosome { get; set; }\n    public double Fitness { get; set; }\n}\n```\n~~~\n\n~~~if:python\nNote: you have a pre-loaded namedtuple `ChromosomeWrap` and you should return a collection of it instead.\n```python\nChromosomeWrap = namedtuple(\"ChromosomeWrap\", [\"chromosome\", \"fitness\"])\n```\n~~~\n\n~~~if:php\nNote: you have to return **an array of associative arrays** instead:\n```php\n// E.g.\narray(\n  array(\"chromosome\" => $c, \"fitness\" => $f),\n  array(\"chromosome\" => $c, \"fitness\" => $f),\n  // ... \n  array(\"chromosome\" => $c, \"fitness\" => $f)\n);\n```\n~~~\n\n# See other katas from this series\n\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #1 Generate](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-1-generate)\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #2 Mutation](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-2-mutation)\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #3 Crossover](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-3-crossover)\n  - **Genetic Algorithm Series - #4 Get population and fitnesses**\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #5 Roulette wheel selection](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-5-roulette-wheel-selection)\n\n*This kata is a piece of [Binary Genetic Algorithm](http://www.codewars.com/kata/526f35b9c103314662000007)*",
