  "description": "# Nodejs package.json\n\nNode applications require a file named `package.json` on the root of the project.\n\nYou can create this file manually or have the command `npm init` to assist you in this process.\n\nThe fields `name` and `version` are mandatory. But there a lot of other fields that you can include:\n\n*for a documentation on all fields see https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json*\n\n  - **name**: must be lowercase and url friendly\n  - **version**: must include major, minor and patch version\n  - **description**: can contain a description of your project\n  - **main**: the entry point of your application (when running `node` without args)\n  - **scripts**: a set of commands that can be executed with `npm run <cmd>`\n  - **keywords**: an array of strings containing keywords that describe your application\n  - **bugs**: an object with the `url` and/or `email` to contact about bugs\n  - **license**: a valid SPDX license or `UNLICENSED` (proprietary) or `SEE LICENSE IN <filename>`\n  - **author**: the name, email and url in a single string or an object with these three properties\n  - **contributors**: an array of items that follow the same rules as author\n  - **repository**: an object with `type` (e.g. `git`) and `url` (e.g. git url)\n  - **private**: `true|false`; if true the repository field can be omitted without any warnings\n  - **preferGlobal**: `true|false`; if your application is preferred to be installed globally\n  - **engines**: object listing engines and versions used by your application\n  - **os**: array of strings with supported OS\n  - **cpu**: array of strings with supported CPU\n  - **dependencies**: run-time dependencies of your application, things that will run in production\n  - **devDependencies**: compile-time dependencies of your application, things that should not be in production\n\nThe `dependencies` is an object with the name of modules as keys and the values are the versions. For example to require `babel` in your application you would have these entries:\n\n```\n{\n  \"babel-core\": \"^6.0.0\",\n  \"babel-polyfill\": \"^6.0.0\",\n  \"babel-preset-es2015\": \"^6.0.0\",\n  \"babel-preset-stage-0\": \"^6.0.0\"\n}\n```\n\n## Your task\n\nCreate a package.json configuration and assign it to the `configuration` constant so it can be tested.\n\nTo **pass the kata** you need only the least that a real package file would require.\n\n## Notes\n\n  - the kata version validation doesn't handle all cases and isn't 100% accurate, so don't try to be too fancy, stick to with the simple\n  - to simplify the license validation this kata only allows the following\n    - ISC\n    - MIT\n    - UNLICENSED\n    - SEE LICENSE IN filename",
