  "description": "We have the numbers with different colours with the sequence: [<span style=\"color:red\">'red'</span>, <span style=\"color:#EEBB00\">'yellow'</span>, <span style=\"color:DodgerBlue\">'blue'</span>].\n\nThat sequence colours the numbers in the following way:\n\n<span style=\"color:red\"> 1 </span> <span style=\"color:#EEBB00\"> 2 </span><span style=\"color:DodgerBlue\">  3 </span> <span style=\"color:red\">  4 </span> <span style=\"color:#EEBB00\">  5 </span> <span style=\"color:DodgerBlue\"> 6 </span><span style=\"color:red\"> 7</span> <span style=\"color:#EEBB00\">  8</span>  <span style=\"color:DodgerBlue\">  9</span> <span style=\"color:red\">  10</span> <span style=\"color:#EEBB00\">  11</span> <span style=\"color:DodgerBlue\"> 12 </span><span style=\"color:red\">  13</span> .....\n\nWe have got the following recursive function:\n\n  ```\nf(1) = 1\nf(n) = f(n - 1) + n\n```\n\nSome terms of this sequence with their corresponding colour are:\n\n```\nterm   value   colour\n1        1     \"red\"\n2        3     \"blue\"\n3        6     \"blue\"\n4       10     \"red\"\n5       15     \"blue\"\n6       21     \"blue\"\n7       28     \"red\"\n```\n\nThe three terms of the same colour \"blue\", higher than 3, are: `[6, 15, 21]`\n\nWe need a function `same_col_seq(), that may receive three arguments:\n\n- `val`, an integer number\n- `k`, an integer number\n- `colour`, the name of one of the three colours(red, yellow or blue), as a string.\n\nThe function will output a sorted array with the smallest `k` terms, having the same marked colour, but higher than `val`.\n\nLet's see some examples:\n\n```python\nsame_col_seq(3, 3, 'blue') == [6, 15, 21]\nsame_col_seq(100, 4, 'red') == [136, 190, 253, 325]\n```\n\nThe function may output an empty list if it does not find terms of the sequence with the wanted colour in the range [val, 2* k * val]\n\n```python\nsame_col_seq(250, 6, 'yellow') == []\n```\n\nThat means that the function did not find any \"yellow\" term in the range `[250, 3000]`\n \nTests will be with the following features:\n\n* Nmber of tests: `100`\n* `100 < val < 1000000`\n* `3 < k < 20`\n",
