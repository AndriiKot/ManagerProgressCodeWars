  "description": "Given an array, return the difference between the count of even numbers and the count of odd numbers. `0` will be considered an even number. \n\n```\nFor example:\nsolve([0,1,2,3]) = 0 because there are two even numbers and two odd numbers. Even - Odd = 2 - 2 = 0.  \n```\n\nLet's now add two letters to the last example: \n```\nsolve([0,1,2,3,'a','b']) = 0. Again, Even - Odd = 2 - 2 = 0. Ignore letters. \n```\n\nThe input will be an array of lowercase letters and numbers only. \n\nIn some languages (Haskell, C++, and others), input will be an array of strings:\n\n```\nsolve [\"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"a\",\"b\"] = 0 \n```\n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you like this Kata, please try: \n\n[Longest vowel chain](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59c5f4e9d751df43cf000035)\n\n[Word values](https://www.codewars.com/kata/598d91785d4ce3ec4f000018)",
