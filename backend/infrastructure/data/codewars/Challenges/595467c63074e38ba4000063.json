  "description": "# Task\n\nJohn is a hacker. He succeeded in invading a server. \n\nHis next job is to write `n` numbers(1...n) in the memory of the server. He did this by using a virus code he wrote.\n\nUnfortunately, since the server only accepts binary digits, and his virus code doesn't take into account the problem, only a fraction of the numbers are written into memory.\n\nGiven a number `n`, your task is to calculate how many numbers are written into memory.\n\nNote, `n` may be very huge, so, it will be given by a string.\n\n# Example\n\nFor `n = \"10\"`, the output should be `2`.\n\n2 number `\"1\"` and `\"10\"` are written into memory.\n\nFor `n = \"20\"`, the output should be `3`.\n\n3 number `\"1\"`, `\"10\"` and `\"11\"` are written into memory.\n\nFor `n = \"100\"`, the output should be `4`.\n\n4 number `\"1\"`, `\"10\"`, `\"11\"` and `\"100\"` are written into memory.\n\n",
