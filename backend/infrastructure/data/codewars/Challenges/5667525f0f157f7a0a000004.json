  "description": "There are just some things you can't do on television. In this case, you've just come back from having a \"delicious\" Barth burger and you're set to give an interview. The Barth burger has made you queezy, and you've forgotten some of the import rules of the \"You Can't Do That on Television\" set.\n\nIf you say any of the following words a large bucket of \"water\" will be dumped on you:\n\"water\", \"wet\", \"wash\"\nThis is true for any form of those words, like \"washing\", \"watered\", etc.\n\nIf you say any of the following phrases you will be doused in \"slime\":\n\"I don't know\", \"slime\"\n\nIf you say both in one sentence, a combination of water and slime, \"sludge\", will be dumped on you.\n\nWrite a function, bucketOf(str), that takes a string and determines what will be dumped on your head. If you haven't said anything you shouldn't have, the bucket should be filled with \"air\". The words should be tested regardless of case.\n\nExamples:\n```javascript\nbucketOf(\"What is that, WATER?!?\") -> \"water\"\nbucketOf(\"I don't know if I'm doing this right.\") -> \"slime\"\nbucketOf(\"You won't get me!\") -> \"air\"\n```\n```java\nbucketOf(\"What is that, WATER?!?\") -> \"water\"\nbucketOf(\"I don't know if I'm doing this right.\") -> \"slime\"\nbucketOf(\"You won't get me!\") -> \"air\"\n```\n```coffeescript\nbucketOf(\"What is that, WATER?!?\") -> \"water\"\nbucketOf(\"I don't know if I'm doing this right.\") -> \"slime\"\nbucketOf(\"You won't get me!\") -> \"air\"\n```\n```ruby\nbucket_of(\"What is that, WATER?!?\") -> \"water\"\nbucket_of(\"I don't know if I'm doing this right.\") -> \"slime\"\nbucket_of(\"You won't get me!\") -> \"air\"\n```\n```cpp\nbucketOf(\"What is that, WATER?!?\") -> \"water\"\nbucketOf(\"I don't know if I'm doing this right.\") -> \"slime\"\nbucketOf(\"You won't get me!\") -> \"air\"\n```\n\n<div style=\"width: 320px; text-align: center; color: white; border: white 1px solid;\">\nCheck out my other 80's Kids Katas:\n</div>\n<div>\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-1-how-many-licks-does-it-take'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #1:</span> How Many Licks Does It Take</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-2-help-alf-find-his-spaceship'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #2:</span> Help Alf Find His Spaceship</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-3-punky-brewsters-socks'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #3:</span> Punky Brewster's Socks</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-4-legends-of-the-hidden-temple'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #4:</span> Legends of the Hidden Temple</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-5-you-cant-do-that-on-television'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #5:</span> You Can't Do That on Television</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-6-rock-em-sock-em-robots'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #6:</span> Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em Robots</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-7-shes-a-small-wonder'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #7:</span> She's a Small Wonder</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-8-the-secret-world-of-alex-mack'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #8:</span> The Secret World of Alex Mack</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-9-down-in-fraggle-rock'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #9:</span> Down in Fraggle Rock </a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-10-captain-planet'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #10:</span> Captain Planet </a><br />\n\n\n</div>\n",
