  "description": "In an internal chat system called the l1t'l bots, a chat is performed by using an alphanumeric sequence send from one bot to the other.\n\nThe protocol followed to validate-complete a chat is shown below:\n```\nSum of digits in first bot must equal sum of digits in the second bot.\n           Note: all numbers are expected to be positive.\n```\n\nYou are required to code a chat validator for the above system. The validator should take in an array of the message send by a pair of bots and validate the conversation by returning a response of **true or false**.\n\n\n***Note:***\n&nbsp;\n\nThe mini bots can only hold a program of **up to 75 characters max** due to memory limitations of the system.",
