  "description": "Create a method **take_while** that accepts a list and a block, and returns a array of the first several elements from the list, for as long as the block returns true.\n\nKeep in mind, we don't want all the items for which the block returns true; once we get a false response, we want to stop looking. So this example:\n\n    take_while([0,1,2,3,4,5,6]){|item| item.even?}\n    \nWill only return **[0]**, not **[0,2,4,6]**.\n\nIf you need help, here's a reference:\n\nhttp://www.rubycuts.com/enum-take-while",
