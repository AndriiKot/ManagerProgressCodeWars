  "description": "Complete the function that calculates the derivative of a polynomial. A polynomial is an expression like: `$ 3x^4 - 2x^2 + x - 10 $`\n\n### How to calculate the derivative:\n\n* Take the exponent and multiply it with the coefficient\n* Reduce the exponent by 1\n\nFor example, derivative of `$ 3x^4 $` is `$ (4\\cdot3)x^{4-1} = 12x^3 $`\n\n\n### Good to know:\n\n* The derivative of a constant is 0.\n* Anything to the 0th exponent equals 1 (e.g. `$ x^0 = 1 $`).\n* The derivative of the sum of two function is the sum of the derivatives.\n\n\n### Notes:\n\n* The exponentiation is marked with `^`\n* Exponents are always integers and >= 0\n* Exponents are written only if > 1\n* There are no spaces around the operators\n* Leading `+` signs are omitted\n\n### Examples\n\n```text\nDerivative of \"-100\"      is \"0\"\nDerivative of \"4x+1\"      is \"4\"\nDerivative of \"-x^2+3x+4\" is \"-2x+3\"\n```",
