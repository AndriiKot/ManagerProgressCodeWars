  "description": "In this Kata, you will be given a number `n` (`n > 0`) and your task will be to return the smallest square number `N` (`N > 0`) such that `n + N` is also a perfect square. If there is no answer, return `-1` (`nil` in Clojure, `Nothing` in Haskell, `None` in Rust). \n\n```clojure \nsolve 13 = 36\n; because 36 is the smallest perfect square that can be added to 13 to form a perfect square => 13 + 36 = 49\n\nsolve 3 = 1 ; 3 + 1 = 4, a perfect square\nsolve 12 = 4 ; 12 + 4 = 16, a perfect square\nsolve 9 = 16 \nsolve 4 = nil\n```\n\n```csharp \nsolve(13) = 36\n//because 36 is the smallest perfect square that can be added to 13 to form a perfect square => 13 + 36 = 49\n\nsolve(3) = 1 // 3 + 1 = 4, a perfect square\nsolve(12) = 4 // 12 + 4 = 16, a perfect square\nsolve(9) = 16 \nsolve(4) = -1\n```\n\n```cpp\nsolve(13) = 36\n//because 36 is the smallest perfect square that can be added to 13 to form a perfect square => 13 + 36 = 49\n\nsolve(3) = 1 // 3 + 1 = 4, a perfect square\nsolve(12) = 4 // 12 + 4 = 16, a perfect square\nsolve(9) = 16 \nsolve(4) = -1\n```\n\n```rust\nsolve(13) = 36\n//because 36 is the smallest perfect square that can be added to 13 to form a perfect square => 13 + 36 = 49\n\nsolve(3) = Some(1) // 3 + 1 = 4, a perfect square\nsolve(12) = Some(4) // 12 + 4 = 16, a perfect square\nsolve(9) = Some(16) \nsolve(4) = None\n```\n\n```haskell \nsolve 13 = Just 36\n-- because 36 is the smallest perfect square that can be added to 13 to form a perfect square => 13 + 36 = 49\n\nsolve 3 = Just 1 -- 3 + 1 = 4, a perfect square\nsolve 12 = Just 4 -- 12 + 4 = 16, a perfect square\nsolve 9 = Just 16 \nsolve 4 = Nothing\n```\n\n```elixir\nsolve(13) = 36\n# because 36 is the smallest perfect square that can be added to 13 to form a perfect square => 13 + 36 = 49\n\nsolve(3) = 1 # 3 + 1 = 4, a perfect square\nsolve(12) = 4 # 12 + 4 = 16, a perfect square\nsolve(9) = 16 \nsolve(4) = -1\n```\n\n```python\nsolve(13) = 36\n# because 36 is the smallest perfect square that can be added to 13 to form a perfect square => 13 + 36 = 49\n\nsolve(3) = 1 # 3 + 1 = 4, a perfect square\nsolve(12) = 4 # 12 + 4 = 16, a perfect square\nsolve(9) = 16 \nsolve(4) = -1\n```\n\n```ruby\nsolve(13) = 36\n# because 36 is the smallest perfect square that can be added to 13 to form a perfect square => 13 + 36 = 49\n\nsolve(3) = 1 # 3 + 1 = 4, a perfect square\nsolve(12) = 4 # 12 + 4 = 16, a perfect square\nsolve(9) = 16 \nsolve(4) = -1\n```\n\n```javascript\nsolve(13) = 36\n//because 36 is the smallest perfect square that can be added to 13 to form a perfect square => 13 + 36 = 49\n\nsolve(3) = 1 // 3 + 1 = 4, a perfect square\nsolve(12) = 4 // 12 + 4 = 16, a perfect square\nsolve(9) = 16 \nsolve(4) = -1\n```\n\nMore examples in test cases. \n\nGood luck!
