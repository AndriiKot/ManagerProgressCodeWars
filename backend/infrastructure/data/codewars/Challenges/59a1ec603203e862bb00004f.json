  "description": "The number `198` has the property that `198 = 11 + 99 + 88, i.e., if each of its digits is concatenated twice and then summed, the result will be the original number`. It turns out that `198` is the only number with this property. However, the property can be generalized so that each digit is concatenated `n` times and then summed. \n\n## Examples\n```\noriginal number =2997 , n=3\n2997 = 222+999+999+777 and here each digit is concatenated three times.\n\noriginal number=-2997 , n=3\n\n-2997 = -222-999-999-777 and here each digit is concatenated three times.\n```\n## Task\n\n```if:python\nWrite a function named `check_concatenated_sum` that tests if a number has this generalized property.\n```\n```if-not:python\nWrite a function named `checkConcatenatedSum` that tests if a number has this generalized property.\n```\n",
