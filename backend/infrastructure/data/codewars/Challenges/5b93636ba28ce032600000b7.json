  "description": "Jack and Jill are playing a game. They have balls numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Jack looks the other way and asks Jill to reverse the position of the balls, for instance, to change the order from say, `0,1,2,3` to `3,2,1,0`. He further asks Jill to reverse the position of the balls `n` times, each time starting from one position further to the right, till she reaches the last ball. So, Jill has to reverse the positions of the ball starting from position `0`, then from position `1`, then from position `2` and so on. At the end of the game, Jill will ask Jack to guess the final position of any ball numbered `k`. \n\nYou will be given `2` integers, the first will be `n`(balls numbered from `0` to `n-1`) and the second will be `k`. You will return the position of the ball numbered `k` after the rearrangement.\n\n```Perl\nsolve(4,1) = 3. The reversals are [0,1,2,3] -> [3,2,1,0] -> [3,0,1,2] -> [3,0,2,1]. => 1 is in position 3.\n```\n\nMore examples in the test cases. Good luck!",
