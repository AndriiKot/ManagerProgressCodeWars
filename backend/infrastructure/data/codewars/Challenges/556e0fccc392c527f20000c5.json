  "description": "If you have completed the <a href=\"http://www.codewars.com/kata/tribonacci-sequence\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tribonacci sequence\">Tribonacci sequence kata</a>, you would know by now that mister Fibonacci has at least a bigger brother. If not, give it a quick look to get how things work.\n\nWell, time to expand the family a little more: think of a Quadribonacci starting with a signature of 4 elements and each following element is the sum of the 4 previous, a Pentabonacci (well *Cinquebonacci* would probably sound a bit more italian, but it would also sound really awful) with a signature of 5 elements and each following element is the sum of the 5 previous, and so on.\n\nWell, guess what? You have to build a Xbonacci function that takes a **signature** of X elements *- and remember each next element is the sum of the last X elements -* and returns the first **n** elements of the so seeded sequence.\n\n```\nxbonacci {1,1,1,1} 10 = {1,1,1,1,4,7,13,25,49,94}\nxbonacci {0,0,0,0,1} 10 = {0,0,0,0,1,1,2,4,8,16}\nxbonacci {1,0,0,0,0,0,1} 10 = {1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,6}\nxbonacci {1,1} produces the Fibonacci sequence\n```",
