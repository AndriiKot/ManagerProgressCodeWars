  "description": "Your sweet 4 year old niece has sent you a letter, however she is a little bit of an odd ball, so it needs a bit of decoding. You see she seems to love dinosars and often throws \"trex\" and \"raptor\" in mid sentence when she gets excited, and is convinced all vowels should be replaced by numbers \n```\n(a=0, e=1, i=2, o=3, u=4).\n```\n\nYour challenge is to figure out what she is trying to say and fix her grammar-\n\n## Inputs\n\nA sentence (string) that may consists of:\n\n- lowercase letters `[a-z]`\n- uppercase letters `[A-Z]`\n- digits `[0-4]`\n- spaces `[ ]` (The space would only appear between words)\n\n## Notes\n\n- The returned string should begin with a capital letter and end in a full stop / period\n- letter `i` that is alone and not within another word should be capitalised (e.g., \"i am\", \"i want\"),\n- no need for capitals for names, she's only 4 after all :) \n\n",
