  "description": "## Description\nYou will have to write a function that takes ```total``` as an argument, and returns a list. In this list there should be one or more nested lists; in each of them - three natural numbers ( including 0 ), so that the sum of this three numbers equals ```total```, and the product of this numbers ends with us much zeroes as possible. \n\nYou will need to find all solutions. The ```total``` will be from 1 to 500, so you can use bruteforce. Feel free to create programm that can work not only for 3, but for any amount of numbers!\nNote that you have to output only **unique** sets of numbers in **ascending** order.\n\n## Examples\n```python\nzero_count(407) = [[32, 125, 250]] # 32, 125 and 250 is the only three numbers with sum of 407, that after multiplication have 6 zeroes. Other numbers have less\nzero_count(199) = [[10, 64, 125], [24, 25, 150], [24, 50, 125], [24, 75, 100], [34, 40, 125]] # there is 5 possible solutions\nzero_count(3) = [[0, 0, 3], [0, 1, 2]] # 2 solutions, each of them give 1 trailing zero\n```",
