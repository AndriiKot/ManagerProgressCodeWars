  "description": "Write a function `validate_iban` which checks if a given string is a valid IBAN.\n\nHave a look at the wikipedia-entry for a easy-description of the algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number#Validating_the_IBAN \n\nIBAN-Length and Countries are taken from https://www.iban.com/structure.html and refere to the state from \"03/05/2017\".\nYou will have access to a (preloaded) dictionary (called `@COUNTRIES`) containing id's and their corresponding length.\n\nYou should also ignore every character which is not part of the IBAN.\n\n\n",
