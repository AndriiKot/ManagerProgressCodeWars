  "description": "# Task\n John loves encryption. He can encrypt any string by the following algorithm:\n```\ntake the first and the last letters of the word;\nreplace the letters between them with their number;\nreplace this number with the sum of it digits \n          until a single digit is obtained.\n```\n\nGiven two strings(`s1` and `s2`), return `true` if their encryption is the same, or `false` otherwise.\n\n# Example\n\n For `s1 = \"EbnhGfjklmjhgz\" and s2 = \"Eabcz\"`, the result should be `true`.\n \n ```\n \"EbnhGfjklmjhgz\" --> \"E12z\" --> \"E3z\"\n \"Eabcz\" --> \"E3z\"\n Their encryption is the same.\n ```\n \n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` string `s1`\n\n  The first string to be encrypted.\n  \n  `s1.length >= 3`\n \n \n - `[input]` string `s2`\n\n  The second string to be encrypted.\n\n  `s2.length >= 3`\n  \n  \n - `[output]` a boolean value\n\n `true` if encryption is the same, `false` otherwise.",
