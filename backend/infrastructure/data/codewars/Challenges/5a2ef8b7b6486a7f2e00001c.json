  "description": "In this Kata, you will be given an array of side lengths for a triangle.Your job is to figure out whether the triangle should be classified as Right, Acute, or Obtuse. To learn more about Right, Acute, or Obtuse triangles see here - \n<a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_and_obtuse_triangles\">Acute and Obtuse Triangles</a>\n\nRecall that a in a right triangle, one of the three angles has a value of 90°, in an obtuse angle one of the three angles has a value greater than 90°, and in an acute triangle all three of the angles have measures less than 90°.\n\n\nThe array given will always contain 3 positive integers, and the order of the integers may be random. The side lengths may not produce a valid triangle.\n\nRecall that the sum of the 2 shortest sides of the triangle must be greater than the largest side (hypotenuse) in order for a triangle to be considered valid. \n\nYour function will contain a single array as an argument, such as - \n```javscript\nfunction obtRhtAct([SIDE_LEN_1,SIDE_LEN_2,SIDE_LEN_3]) {\n    //your code here\n    return -1\n}\n```\nYour function should return the following values -\n```\nif (triangle is obtuse) => 0\nif (triangle is right) => 1\nif (triangle is acute) => 2\nif (triangle is invalid) => -1\n```",
