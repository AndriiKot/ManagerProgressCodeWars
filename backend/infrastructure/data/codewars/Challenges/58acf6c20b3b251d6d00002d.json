  "description": "# Task\n Vanya gets bored one day and decides to enumerate a large pile of rocks. He first counts the rocks and finds out that he has `n` rocks in the pile, then he goes to the store to buy labels for enumeration. \n \n Each of the labels is a digit from 0 to 9 and each of the `n` rocks should be assigned a unique number from `1` to `n`.\n\n If each label costs `$1`, how much money will Vanya spend on this project?\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `n`\n\n  The number of rocks in the pile.\n\n  `1  ≤  n  ≤  10^9`\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\n  the cost of the enumeration.\n  \n# Example\n\n For `n = 13`, the result should be `17`.\n ```\n the numbers from 1 to n are:\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13\n we need 17 single digit labels:\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3\n each label cost $1, so the output should be 17.\n ```\n",
