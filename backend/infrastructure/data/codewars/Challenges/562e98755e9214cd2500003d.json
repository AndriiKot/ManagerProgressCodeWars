  "description": "Our friend Pac has finally decided to pursue a career in the coding industry.  \nHe is a newbie, he needs to learn properly.  \nTherefore, Pac wants to apply for the worldwide famous -and very demanding-  \n 'C0d3r 1ns1d3' Academy for beginners.  \nIn order to join, Pac is required to solve a series of 3 exercises about 'Bug Fixes'.  \nHe has been sent an email from the Academy with the following instructions,\n\n```\nDear Pac,  \nThis is the first exercise. Find out what's wrong and fix the code.  \nYou have 15 minutes to send a solution.  \nGood Luck.\n```\n\nThis code is a mess! Would you help Pac to fix the code in time?\n\n(This might be helpful -> [Math.random();](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random))\n\nThis is my first Kata, so please any feedback (especially on Test Cases) is welcome!",
