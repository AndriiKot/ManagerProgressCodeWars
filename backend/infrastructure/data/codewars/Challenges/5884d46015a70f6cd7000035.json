  "description": "[Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) objects are new JavaScript built-in objects defined since [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-set-objects.)\n\nA **Set** lets you store unique values of any type. It comes with some useful methods like `.add`, `.clear`, `.has` . . . **BUT** some \"Set operations\" are missing, like . . . \n\n# Intersection\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Venn0001.svg/330px-Venn0001.svg.png\" style=\"max-width:200px\">\n\nA new set can be constructed by determining which members two sets have \"in common\". The **intersection** of A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set of all things that are members of both A and B. If A ∩ B = ∅, then A and B are said to be **disjoint**.\n\n### Examples:\n```\n  {1, 2} ∩ {1, 2} = {1, 2}.\n  {1, 2} ∩ {2, 3} = {2}.\n```\n# Task\n\nCreate function `inter` getting 2 sets as arguments and returning a **new Set** as result of intersection of these 2 sets.\n### Examples:\n```javascript\nA = new Set([1,2]);\nB = new Set([2,3]);\n\nC = inter(A,B) // -> {2}\n```\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\" May the Code be with you ! \"\n<img src=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/extensions/wikihiero/img/hiero_E20.png\" align=\"right\" title=\"There's more than ONE Set!\">",
