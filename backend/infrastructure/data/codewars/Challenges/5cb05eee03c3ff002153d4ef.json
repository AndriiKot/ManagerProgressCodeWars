  "description": "Your website is divided vertically in sections, and each can be of different size (height).  \nYou need to establish the section index (starting at `0`) you are at, given the `scrollY` and `sizes` of all sections.  \nSections start with `0`, so if first section is `200` high, it takes `0-199` \"pixels\" and second starts at `200`.\n\n### Example:\n\n~~~if-not:factor\nWith `scrollY = 300` and `sizes = [300,200,400,600,100]`\n\nthe result will be `1` as it's the second section.\n\nWith `scrollY = 1600` and `size = [300,200,400,600,100]`\n\nthe result will be `-1` as it's past last section.\n~~~\n~~~if:factor\nWith `scrollY = 300` and `sizes = { 300 200 400 600 100 }`\n\nthe result will be `1` as it's the second section.\n\nWith `scrollY = 1600` and `size = { 300 200 400 600 100 }`\n\nthe result will be `-1` as it's past last section.\n~~~\n\nGiven the `scrollY` integer (always non-negative) and an array of non-negative integers (with at least one element), calculate the index (starting at `0`) or `-1` if `scrollY` falls beyond last section (indication of an error).",
