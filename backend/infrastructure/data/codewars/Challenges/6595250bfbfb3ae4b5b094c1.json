  "description": "Introduction\n\nYou've played an enourmous amount of RPGs before and one particular thought suddenly appeared in your mind: ```\"What if I became an automated DM?\"```\n\nAn interesting idea. Such a shame it could never be implemented... Or could it?\nLuckily for you, you know ```insert your programming language here```. So it's possible for you to make a function for players to make automated saving throws, damage rolls, etc.\n\nYour task:\n\nImplement a function, which takes two to three arguments:\n1. A string ```xdn```, where ```x``` is the number of dice you have to throw to pass a check or a saving throw, and ```n``` is the number of sides these dice have. ```d``` here simply means \"dice\".\n2. An integer ```mod```, which has to be added to your throw to make a final result.\n3. In some cases you will also be given an integer ```dc``` (Difficulty class), which is basically a threshhold you have to pass with your result.\n\nIf ```dc``` is present, your function should return a Boolean value (```True``` or ```False```), depending on whether your result is ```greater than``` or ```equals``` the Difficulty class ```dc```. Note that this argument is only given if your ``xdn``` is ```1d20```.\n\nIf ```dc``` is absent, just return the result.\n\n```Restrictions```:\n1. -40 <= ```mod``` <= 50\n2. 1 <= ```dc``` <= 70 if present\n3. ```xdn``` is always going to be a legitimate string.\n4. ```x``` >= 1 and ```n``` can be one of: ```[3,4,6,8,10,20]```\n5. If your final result is ```less than or equals 0```, return ```0```\n\nExamples:\n\nInput:\n\n```xdn=\"2d4\", mod=2```\n\nOutput range: from ```4``` to ```10```\n\nInput 2:\n\n```xdn=\"1d20\", mod=-4, dc=17```\n\nOutput 2: ```False```\n\nInput 3: \n\n```xdn=\"1d20\", mod=11, dc=12```\n\nOutput 3: ```True```\n\nHappy coding everyone and may your DM guide you on your adventures!",
