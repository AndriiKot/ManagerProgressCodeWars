  "description": "In recreational mathematics, a [Keith number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_number) or repfigit number (short for repetitive Fibonacci-like digit) is a number in the following integer sequence:\n\n`14, 19, 28, 47, 61, 75, 197, 742, 1104, 1537, 2208, 2580, 3684, 4788, 7385, 7647, 7909, ...` (sequence A007629 in the OEIS)\n\nKeith numbers were introduced by Mike Keith in 1987. They are computationally very challenging to find, with only about 100 known.\n\nImplement the code to check if the given number is a Keith number. Return the number number of iteration needed to confirm it; otherwise return `false`.\n\n**Note:** 1-digit numbers are **not** Keith numbers by definition\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nn = 197      # --> [1, 9, 7]\n\n# calculation           iteration\n1 + 9 + 7 = 17         #    1\n9 + 7 + 17 = 33        #    2\n7 + 17 + 33 = 57       #    3\n17 + 33 + 57 = 107     #    4\n33 + 57 + 107 = 197    #    5\n```\nAs `197` is the same as the initial number, so it's a Keith number: return `5`\n\n\nAnother example:\n```\nn = 196\n\n# calculation          iteration\n1 + 9 + 6 = 16        #    1\n...\n```\n\n`196` is not a Keith number, so return `false`",
