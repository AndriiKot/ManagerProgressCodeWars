  "description": "# Sorting an array of positive integers\n\n## Background\n\nYou are a(n) novice/average/senior/professional/world-class (choose one) Computer Scientist and Web Developer who specialises in Javascript (choose the language of your choice).  One day, while you were away, your naughty little brother fiddles with your computer and somehow manages to disable the ```sort()``` method for arrays!\n\n## Task\n\nBeing the developer that you are, you decide to fix the ```sort()``` method so that it works for any array **consisting of only positive integers**.  You may use any algorithm you wish.\n\n## Extension\n\nIf you wish, you could also fix the ```sort()``` method for arrays such that it also works on String arrays (sorting them into alphabetical order) but please note that *it is not required and will not be tested*.",
