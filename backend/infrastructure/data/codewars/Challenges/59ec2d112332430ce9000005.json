  "description": "In this Kata, you will be given two numbers, `a` and `b`, and your task is to determine if the first number `a` is divisible by `all` the prime factors of the second number `b`. For example: `solve(15,12) = False` because `15` is not divisible by all the prime factors of `12` (which include`2`).\n\nSee test cases for more examples. \n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you like this Kata, please try:\n\n[Sub-array division](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59eb64cba954273cd4000099)\n\n[Divisor harmony](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59bf97cd4f98a8b1cd00007e)",
