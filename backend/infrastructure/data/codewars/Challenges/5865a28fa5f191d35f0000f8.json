  "description": "Write a function `take_umbrella()` that takes two arguments: a string representing the current weather and a float representing the chance of rain today.\n\nYour function should return `True` or `False` based on the following criteria.\n\n* You should take an umbrella if it's currently raining or if it's cloudy and the chance of rain is over `0.20`.\n* You shouldn't take an umbrella if it's sunny unless it's more likely to rain than not.\n\nThe options for the current weather are `sunny`, `cloudy`, and `rainy`.\n\nFor example, `take_umbrella('sunny', 0.40)` should return `False`.\n\nAs an additional challenge, consider solving this kata using only logical operaters and not using any `if` statements.",
