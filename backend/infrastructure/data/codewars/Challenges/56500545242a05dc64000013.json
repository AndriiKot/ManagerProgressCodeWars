  "description": "Many plants produce their leaves spiralling up the stem, with each successive leaf separated by an angle of approximately 137.5 degrees. This is known as Fibonacci Phyllotaxis and the angle is called the Golden Angle. It allows the plant to access as much sunlight as possible. \n\nBut some plants follow a different phyllotaxy where successive leaves are separated by, say 100 degrees, and this works well for them too.\n\n<h3>The exercise:</h3>\nWrite a function that: \n<ul>\n <li>takes two inputs ```angleATron``` and ```leafNumber``` </li>\n <li>returns an object containing leaf numbers and angles. The expected angle is the angle between the first leaf and ```leafNumber==n```, where n is a leaf from 1 to ```leafNumber```</li>\n </ul>\n\nThe ```anlgeATron``` is an angle expressed in degrees. It represents the angle  separating each successive leaf from its predecessor. So the ```anlgeATron``` for plants exhibiting Fibonacci Phyllotaxis is 137.5 degrees.\n\nThe ```leafNumber``` is a whole number representing the nth leaf that grows from the stem. \n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n```javascript\nTest.assertSimilar(prediction(137.5,5) => { 'leaf 1': '0.0 degrees',\n  'leaf 2': '137.5 degrees',\n  'leaf 3': '275.0 degrees',\n  'leaf 4': '52.5 degrees',\n  'leaf 5': '190.0 degrees' })\n```\nAngles should be to 1 decimal place and no greater than 360 degrees.\n\n<em>The word angle-a-tron comes from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOIP_Z_-0Hs</em>",
