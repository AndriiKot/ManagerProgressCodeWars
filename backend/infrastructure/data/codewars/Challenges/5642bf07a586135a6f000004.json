  "description": "Step through my `green glass door`.\n\nYou can take the `moon`, but not the `sun`.\n\nYou can take your `slippers`, but not your `sandals`.\n\nYou can go through `yelling`, but not `shouting`.\n\nYou can't run through `fast`, but you can run with `speed`.\n\nYou can take a `sheet`, but not your `blanket`.\n\nYou can wear your `glasses`, but not your `contacts`.\n\nHave you figured it out? Good! Then write a program that can figure it out as well.\n",
