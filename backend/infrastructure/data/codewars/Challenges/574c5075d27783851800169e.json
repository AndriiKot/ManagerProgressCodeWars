  "description": "# Description\n\nEverybody has probably heard of the animal heads and legs problem from the earlier years at school. It goes:\n\n```\n“A farm contains chickens and cows. \nThere are x heads and y legs. \nHow many chickens and cows are there?”\n```\n\nWhere x <= 1000 and y <=1000\n\n# Task\n\nAssuming there are no other types of animals, work out how many of each animal are there. \n\n```\nReturn a tuple in Python - (chickens, cows) \nor an array list - [chickens, cows]/{chickens, cows} in all other languages\n```\n\nIf either the heads & legs is negative, the result of your calculation is negative or the calculation is a float return \"No solutions\" (no valid cases), or [-1, -1] in COBOL.\n\n\nIn the form:\n```python\n(Heads, Legs) = (72, 200)\n\nVALID - (72, 200) =>             (44 , 28) \n                             (Chickens, Cows)\n\nINVALID - (72, 201) => \"No solutions\"\n```\n```javascript\n[Heads, Legs] = [72, 200]\n\nVALID - [72, 200] =>             [44 , 28]   \n                             [Chickens, Cows]\n\nINVALID - [72, 201] => \"No solutions\"\n```\n```ruby\n[Heads, Legs] = [72, 200]\n\nVALID - [72, 200] =>             [44 , 28]   \n                             [Chickens, Cows]\n\nINVALID - [72, 201] => \"No solutions\"\n```\n\n```cobol\n      Heads = 72\n      Legs  = 200\n      =>\n      Chickens = 44\n      Cows     = 28\n      \n      Heads = 72\n      Legs  = 201\n      =>\n      Chickens = -1\n      Cows     = -1\n```\n\nHowever, ```if 0 heads and 0 legs are given always return [0, 0]``` since zero heads must give zero animals.\n\n\nThere are many different ways to solve this, but they all give the same answer.\n\nYou will only be given integers types - however negative values (edge cases) will be given. \n\n\nHappy coding!",
