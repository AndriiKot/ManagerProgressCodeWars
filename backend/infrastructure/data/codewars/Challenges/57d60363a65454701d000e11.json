  "description": "## Description\nYou are a *Fruit Ninja*, your skill is cutting fruit. All the fruit will be cut in half by your knife. For example:\n\n```\n[  \"apple\",     \"pear\",     \"banana\"  ]  --> [\"app\", \"le\", \"pe\", \"ar\", \"ban\", \"ana\"]\n```\nAs you see, all fruits are cut in half. You should pay attention to `\"apple\"`: if you cannot cut a fruit into equal parts, then the first part will has a extra character.\n\nYou should only cut the fruit, other things **should not be cut**, such as the `\"bomb\"`:\n```\n[  \"apple\",     \"pear\",     \"banana\",   \"bomb\"]  -->\n[\"app\", \"le\", \"pe\", \"ar\", \"ban\", \"ana\", \"bomb\"]\n```\n\nThe valid fruit names are preloaded for you as:\n```javascript\nfruitsName\n```\n```ruby\n$fruits_name\n```\n```python\nFRUIT_NAMES\n```\n```haskell\nfruits\n```\n\n\n## Task\n\n```if:javascript\nComplete function `cutFruits` that accepts argument `fruits`.\nReturns the result in accordance with the rules above.\n```\n```if:ruby,python\nComplete function `cut_fruits` that accepts argument `fruits`.\nReturns the result in accordance with the rules above.\n```\n```if:haskell\nComplete function cutFruits that accepts a String array/list.\nReturns the result in accordance with the rules above.\n```\n\nOK, that's all. I guess this is a 7kyu kata. If you agree, please rank it as 7kyu and vote `very`;-) If you think this kata is too easy or too hard, please shame me by rank it as you want and vote `somewhat` or `none` :[\n\n---\n\n##### *[Click here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/?q=i+guess+this+is+a+kyu+kata)  for more more \"I guess this is ...kyu\" katas!*",
