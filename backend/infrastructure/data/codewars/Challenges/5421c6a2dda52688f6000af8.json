  "description": "__Function composition__ is a mathematical operation that mainly presents itself in lambda calculus and computability. It is explained well [here](http://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/functions-composition.html), but this is my explanation, in simple mathematical notation:\n\n```\nf3 = compose( f1 f2 )\n   Is equivalent to...\nf3(a) = f1( f2( a ) )\n```\n~~~if-not:lambdacalc,ruby\nYour task is to create a `compose` function to carry out this task, which will be passed two functions or lambdas. Ruby functions will be passed, and should return, either a proc or a lambda. Remember that the resulting composed function may be passed multiple arguments!\n~~~\n~~~if:ruby\nYour task is to create a `compose` function to carry out this task, which will be passed two functions, and should return either a proc or a lambda.
