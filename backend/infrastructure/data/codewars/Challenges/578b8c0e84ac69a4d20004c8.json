  "description": "In this Kata, we will calculate running pace. To do that, we have to know the distance and the time. \n\nCreate the following function:\n\n```if:python\n`running_pace(distance, time)`\n```\n```if:javascript, typescript\n`runningPace(distance, time)`\n```\n\nWhere:\n`distance` - A float with the number of kilometres\n\n`time` - A string containing the time it took to travel the distance. It will always be minutes:seconds. For example \"25:00\" means 25 minutes. You don't have to deal with hours.\n\nThe function should return the pace, for example \"4:20\" means it took 4 minutes and 20 seconds to travel one kilometre.\n\n**Note**: The pace should always return only the number of minutes and seconds. You don't have to convert these into hours. Floor the number of seconds.\n\n",
