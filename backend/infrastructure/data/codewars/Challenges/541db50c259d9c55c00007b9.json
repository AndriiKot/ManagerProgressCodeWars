  "description": "JavaScript (and CoffeeScript by extension) is a language that is heavily dependent on a **run-time environment**.  While most people learn JS in a *browser* environment, there are [other environments that run outside of a browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Uses_outside_web_pages).  Codewars runs your code in a *[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)* environment.\n\nThis kata is an attempt to introduce the NodeJS environment.\n\nEnvironment Differences\n----\n\nThe runtime environment gives your code the ability to interact with software outside of the language itself.  For example, a browser environment has several built-ins that let you interact with a webpage.  You can use functions like `getElementById` or `XMLHttpRequest`.\n\n[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), however, cannot use those browser-specific built-ins (go ahead, try).  Node.js is an environment for javascript that is meant to run on your computer (server-side).  So while you lose the ability to work with browser built-ins, you gain access to NodeJS-specific code.\n\nKata\n-----\n\nWe are going to replicate the kata [Base64 Encoding](http://www.codewars.com/kata/base64-encoding/javascript), but instead of creating our own encoding / decoding functions, we will use [NodeJS' Buffer module](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) to do it for us.\n\nCreate the function `String.prototype.toBase64` that encodes a string in Base64.  Also create the function `String.prototype.fromBase64` that decodes a Base64 string into `utf8`.\n\nExamples\n----\n```javascript\n// should return 'dGhpcyBpcyBhIHN0cmluZyEh'\n'this is a string!!'.toBase64(); \n\n// should return 'this is a string!!'\n'dGhpcyBpcyBhIHN0cmluZyEh'.fromBase64();\n```\n```coffeescript\n# should return 'dGhpcyBpcyBhIHN0cmluZyEh'\n\"this is a string!!\".toBase64()\n\n# should return 'this is a string!!'\n\"dGhpcyBpcyBhIHN0cmluZyEh\".fromBase64()\n```\n    \nTips\n----\n\nTo use a NodeJS module, you need to `require` it into your code.  For example, if I wanted to use the `util` module, I could write\n```javascript\n// require the 'util' module into your code\nconst util = require('util');\nconsole.log(util.isRegExp(/hi/));\n```\n```coffeescript\nutil = require \"util\"\nconsole.log util.isRegExp /hi/\n```\nThe NodeJS built-in function `require` knows exactly how to find the module, so no extra work is needed.  After you have `require`d a module into your code, you can use any of the methods / properties for it.\n\nThe [NodeJS documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/) is helpful, so I suggest you look at that.  If you plan on working with NodeJS at all in the future, it is beneficial to know what features it has built-in.",
