  "description": "In mathematics, an n<sup>th</sup> root of a number `x`, where `n` is usually assumed to be a positive integer, is a number `r` which, when raised to the power `n`, yields `x`:\n\n```math\nr^n=x\n```\n\nGiven number `n`, such that `n > 1`, find if its 2<sup>nd</sup> root, 4<sup>th</sup> root and 8<sup>th</sup> root are all integers (fractional part is `0`). Return `true` if yes, `false` if no.\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\n// 2nd root of 256 is 16\n// 4th root of 256 is 4\n// 8th root of 256 is 2\n256 --> true \n\n// 2nd root of 16 is 4\n// 4th root of 16 is 2\n// 8th root of 16 is 1.4142135... --> not an integer\n16 --> false\n```",
