  "description": "When a function is called by itself it is bound to the global context; the `this` variable of the function will be bound to the global object.\n\nWhen the `getNameFunc` function is called on the `alpha` object the value of the `name` variable outside of the object is returned: `\"The Window\"`. \n\nWe do not want this, we want the value of the `name` property inside the `alpha` object to be returned.\n\nFix `getNameFunc` so the right value is returned.\n\nFor more information: [Binding](http://alistapart.com/article/getoutbindingsituations)",
