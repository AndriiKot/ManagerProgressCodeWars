  "description": "The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.   \nLet's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!\n\nHere's the deal:\n\n- It must start with a hashtag (`#`).\n- All words must have their first letter capitalized, and remaining letters lowercased.\n\n~~~if-not:cpp,rust\n- If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return `false`.\n- If the input or the result is an empty string it must return `false`.\n~~~\n\n~~~if:cpp\n- If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return `std::nullopt`.\n- If the input or the result is an empty string it must return `std::nullopt`.\n~~~\n\n~~~if:rust\n- If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return `None`.\n- If the input or the result is an empty string it must return `None`.\n~~~\n\n## Examples\n\n~~~if-not:cpp,rust\n```\n\" Hello there thanks for trying my Kata\"  =>  \"#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata\"\n\"    Hello     World   \"                  =>  \"#HelloWorld\"\n\"\"                                        =>  false\n```\n~~~\n\n~~~if:cpp\n```\n\" Hello there thanks for trying my Kata\"  =>  \"#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata\"\n\"    Hello     World   \"                  =>  \"#HelloWorld\"\n\"\"                                        =>  std::nullopt\n```\n~~~\n\n~~~if:rust\n```\n\" Hello there thanks for trying my Kata\"  =>  Some(\"#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata\")\n\"    Hello     World   \"                  =>  Some(\"#HelloWorld\")\n\"\"                                        =>  None\n```\n~~~\n",
