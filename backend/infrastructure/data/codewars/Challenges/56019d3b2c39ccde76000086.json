  "description": "## Terminal game turn function\n\nYou are creating a text-based terminal version of your favorite board game. In the board game, each turn has six steps that must happen in this order: roll the dice, move, combat, get coins, buy more health, and print status.\n\n---\n\nYou are using a library (`Game.Logic` in C#) that already has the functions below. Create a function named `doTurn/DoTurn/do_turn` that calls the functions in the proper order as described in the paragraph above.\n```javascript\n- combat\n- buyHealth\n- getCoins\n- printStatus\n- rollDice\n- move\n```\n```ruby\n- `combat`\n- `buy_health`\n- `get_coins`\n- `print_status`\n- `roll_dice`\n- `move`\n```\n```python\n- `combat`\n- `buy_health`\n- `get_coins`\n- `print_status`\n- `roll_dice`\n- `move`\n```\n```csharp\n- Combat\n- BuyHealth\n- GetCoins\n- PrintStatus\n- RollDice\n- Move\n```",
