  "description": "A person's full name is usually composed of a first name, middle name and last name; however in some cultures (for example in South India) there may be more than one middle name.\n\nWrite a function that takes the full name of a person, and returns the initials, separated by dots (`'.'`). The initials must be uppercase. The last name of the person must appear in full, with its first letter in uppercase as well.\n\nSee the pattern below:\n```\n\"code wars\"            ---> \"C.Wars\"\n\"Barack hussein obama\" ---> \"B.H.Obama\"\n```\n\nNames in the full name are separated by exactly one space (`' '` )  ; without leading or trailing spaces.\nNames will always be lowercase, except optionally their first letter.",
