  "description": "The Caesar cipher is a notorious (and notoriously simple) algorithm for encrypting a message: each letter is shifted a certain constant number of places in the alphabet. For example, applying a shift of `5` to the string `\"Hello, world!\"` yields `\"Mjqqt, btwqi!\"`, which is jibberish.\n\nIn this kata, your task is to decrypt Caesar-encrypted messages using nothing but your wits, your computer, and a `set` of the 1000 (plus a few) most common words in English in **lowercase** (made available to you as a preloaded variable named `WORDS`, which you may use in your code as if you had defined it yourself).\n\n### Given a message, your function must return the most likely shift value as an integer.\n\nA few hints:\n\n* Be wary of punctuation\n* Shift values may not be higher than 25",
