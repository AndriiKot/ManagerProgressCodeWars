  "description": "# Order Countries in Olympic Games\n\nIn Olympic games, countries are ranked based on the gold, and then silver, and then bronze medals.\n\nYou get a list of countries in the form of a dictionary; the key is the country name, and the value is a string that indicates the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals.\n\nFor example, in this list:\n```csharp\nDictionary<string, string> list = new Dictionary<string, string>()\n            {\n                {\"China\",\"54,32,44\"},\n                {\"Korea\",\"55,33,45\"},\n                {\"Iraq\",\"54,33,45\"},\n                {\"Iran\",\"54,33,45\"},\n                {\"Norway\",\"56,32,45\"},\n                {\"Finland\",\"55,34,45\"}\n            };\n```\n```ruby\nlist = {\n  \"China\" => \"54,32,44\",\n  \"Korea\" => \"55,33,45\",\n  \"Iraq\" => \"54,33,45\",\n  \"Iran\" => \"54,33,45\",\n  \"Norway\" => \"56,32,45\",\n  \"Finland\" => \"55,34,45\"\n}\n```\nChina has 54 gold medals, 32 silver medals, and 44 bronze medals.\n\nThe result should be a string ordering the countries and separating them by ```-```\nIn the abovementioned example, the output should be:\n\n```Norway-Finland-Korea-Iran-Iraq-China```\n\nIf two countries get similar medals, then you sort them based on alphabetical order.",
