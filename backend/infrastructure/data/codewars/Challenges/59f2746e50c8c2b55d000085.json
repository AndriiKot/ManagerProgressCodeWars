  "description": "You are given `num` (up to `15 digits`, `never less than 0`).</br>\n\nIf the `length of num is even`, return `odd numbers as ints` and `even ones as strings`, based on their `position` in the given number. Strings alternate in type cases: starting in `lowercase` to `uppercase` and so on based on position. If the `length of num is odd`, all the rules are `opposite`. See sample tests. </br>\n\nNote: Positions of numbers are `1-based`.</br>",
