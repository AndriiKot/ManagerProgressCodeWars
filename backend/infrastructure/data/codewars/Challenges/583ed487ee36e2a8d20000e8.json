  "description": "Ninjas frequently need to signal each other in code, often employing natural sounds as a cover. We’re going to give our ninja the ability to chirp like a cricket, with the number of chirps encoding different messages.\n\nImplement a \"recursive function\" that takes one parameter (n) and outputs a string i.e.\n\n``` javascript\n  chirp(4);\n  //output would be chirp-chirp-chirp-chirp.\n```\n\njavascript/coffescript: don't use the String method .repeat(), write a recursive function, remember you're a Ninja!\n\n",
