  "description": "Write a generator `sequence_gen` ( `sequenceGen` in JavaScript) that, given the first terms of a sequence will generate a (potentially) infinite amount of terms, where each subsequent term is the sum of the previous `x` terms where `x` is the amount of initial arguments (examples of such sequences are the Fibonacci, Tribonacci and Lucas number sequences).\n\n##Examples\n```python\nfib = sequence_gen(0, 1)\nnext(fib) = 0 # first term (provided)\nnext(fib) = 1 # second term (provided)\nnext(fib) = 1 # third term (sum of first and second terms)\nnext(fib) = 2 # fourth term (sum of second and third terms)\nnext(fib) = 3 # fifth term (sum of third and fourth terms)\nnext(fib) = 5 # sixth term (sum of fourth and fifth terms)\nnext(fib) = 8 # seventh term (sum of fifth and sixth terms)\n\ntrib = sequence_gen(0,1,1)\nnext(trib) = 0 # first term (provided)\nnext(trib) = 1 # second term (provided)\nnext(trib) = 1 # third term (provided)\nnext(trib) = 2 # fourth term (sum of first, second and third terms)\nnext(trib) = 4 # fifth term (sum of second, third and fourth terms)\nnext(trib) = 7 # sixth term (sum of third, fourth and fifth terms)\n\nlucas = sequence_gen(2,1)\n[next(lucas) for _ in range(10)] = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76]\n```\n```javascript\nfib = sequenceGen(0, 1)\nfib.next().value = 0 // first term (provided)\nfib.next().value = 1 // second term (provided)\nfib.next().value = 1 // third term (sum of first and second terms)\nfib.next().value = 2 // fourth term (sum of second and third terms)\nfib.next().value = 3 // fifth term (sum of third and fourth terms)\nfib.next().value = 5 // sixth term (sum of fourth and fifth terms)\nfib.next().value = 8 // seventh term (sum of fifth and sixth terms)\n\ntrib = sequenceGen(0,1,1)\ntrib.next().value = 0 // first term (provided)\ntrib.next().value = 1 // second term (provided)\ntrib.next().value = 1 // third term (provided)\ntrib.next().value = 2 // fourth term (sum of first, second and third terms)\ntrib.next().value = 4 // fifth term (sum of second, third and fourth terms)\ntrib.next().value = 7 // sixth term (sum of third, fourth and fifth terms)\n\nlucas = sequenceGen(2,1);\narr = [];\nfor(i = 0;i < 10;i++){\n  arr.push(lucas.next().value);\n}\narr === [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76]\n```\n```ruby\nfib = sequence_gen(0, 1) # returns an Enumerator\nfib.next = 0 # first term (provided)\nfib.next = 1 # second term (provided)\nfib.next = 1 # third term (sum of first and second terms)\nfib.next = 2 # fourth term (sum of second and third terms)\nfib.next = 3 # fifth term (sum of third and fourth terms)\nfib.next = 5 # sixth term (sum of fourth and fifth terms)\nfib.next = 8 # seventh term (sum of fifth and sixth terms)\n\ntrib = sequence_gen(0,1,1) # returns an Enumerator\ntrib.next = 0 # first term (provided)\ntrib.next = 1 # second term (provided)\ntrib.next = 1 # third term (provided)\ntrib.next = 2 # fourth term (sum of first, second and third terms)\ntrib.next = 4 # fifth term (sum of second, third and fourth terms)\ntrib.next = 7 # sixth term (sum of third, fourth and fifth terms)\n\nlucas = sequence_gen(2,1) # returns an Enumerator\nlucas.take(10) = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76]\n```\n\n**Note:** You can assume you will get at least one argument and any arguments given will be valid (positive or negative integers) so no error checking is needed.\n\n\n**Note for Ruby users: ** `sequence_gen` should return an Enumerator object.\n\n\nAny feedback/suggestions would much appreciated.",
