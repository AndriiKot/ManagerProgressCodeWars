  "description": ">*\" Under the frozen stars of himalayan nights, yak-boys and yak-girls are used to share chunks of [chhurpi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhurpi) and hot cups of  [ja-srub-ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter_tea) to the sound of [sgra-snyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramyin) near a [g.yag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_yak) dung fire.* \n\n>*After a while they also like to play card games. \"*\n\n\nOne of these games is called \"**<span style=\"font-size:larger\">YaCg</span>**\" (yEt AnOtHeR cArD Game).\n\n# Rules\n\n**Yacg** is a [trick-taking game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick-taking_game) *ie* a game in which series of rounds, called \"**tricks**\",\nare played. At the end of a \"trick\" the winner of the trick \"takes\" it (and becomes the \"**trick-taker**\").\n\nA standard 52-card pack is used. The cards in each suit rank from highest to lowest: `A K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2`.\n\nThe trick is won by the **highest** card.\n\n# Task\nCode a function `winnerOfTrick( cards, players )` which return the name of the \"**trick-taker**\" ie the one who played the highest ranked card.\n\n### Input\n* `cards` is an array of card-codes of the form \"RS\" where :\n    * \"R\" is the *rank* of the card ( one of `A, K, Q, J, T (for 10), 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 or 2` ) \n    * \"S\" is the *suit * of the card (one of `\"H\" (Hearts), \"C\" (Clubs), \"D\" (Diamonds) and \"S\" (Spades)`)\n    \n  *eg* : `[ \"2H\", \"3H\", \"4C\", \"KD\", \"AS\" ]`\n  \n\n* `players` is an array of yagc-fanatic yak-boys/girls.\n\n  *eg* : `[ \"Algichh\", \"Bdobd\", \"Charmolg\", \"Dbang\", \"Erming\" ]`\n\n\nIf players length is longer than cards length just ignore additional players.\n\n### Output\n* a string of the form \"`Bdobd wins`\" or \"`Tie! (Dbang,Erming)`\" if a tie occurs.\n\n\n### Examples:\n```\nwinnerOfTrick( [\"2D\", \"4D\", \"3S\"],  [\"GgbA\", \"mZoIs\", \"S'Lg\"] ) // -> \"mZoIs wins\" (\"4D\" is the highest)\nwinnerOfTrick( [\"4D\", \"2H\", \"4S\"],  [\"GgbA\", \"mZoIs\", \"S'Lg\"] ) // -> \"Tie! (GgbA,S'Lg)\" (\"4D\" and \"4S\" are the highest)\nwinnerOfTrick( [\"2D\", \"KH\", \"QH\"],  [\"mZoIs\", \"GgbA\", \"S'Lg\"] ) // -> \"GgbA wins\" (\"KH\" is the highest)\n```\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\"* gMay the gCode be with gYou ! *\"\n<hr><br>\n<pre style=\"text-align:right\">\n           (_____)\"\"\"._  \n  gMooo     (oo)      \\ \n      `---   \\/       |*\n              ^^\"\"\"\"\"^^ \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n (gMooo = yakish for \"mooo\")\n</pre>\n\n",
