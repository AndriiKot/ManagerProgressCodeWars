  "description": "The odd and even numbers are fighting against each other!\n\nYou are given a list of positive integers. The odd numbers from the list will fight using their `1` bits from their binary representation, while the even numbers will fight using their `0` bits. If present in the list, number `0` will be neutral, hence not fight for either side.\n\nYou should return:\n\n* `odds win` if number of `1`s from odd numbers is larger than `0`s from even numbers\n* `evens win` if number of `1`s from odd numbers is smaller than `0`s from even numbers\n* `tie` if equal, including if list is empty\n\nPlease note that any prefix that might appear in the binary representation, e.g. `0b`, should not be counted towards the battle.\n\n### Example:\nFor an input list of `[5, 3, 14]`:\n\n* odds: `5` and `3` => `101` and `11` => four `1`s\n* evens: `14` => `1110` => one `0`\n\nResult: `odds win` the battle with 4-1\n\nIf you enjoyed this kata, you can find a nice variation of it [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/world-bits-war).",
