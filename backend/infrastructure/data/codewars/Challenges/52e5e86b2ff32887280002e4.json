  "description": "There are all types of cylons. The trick is, some look like humans.  Using prototypical inheritance, create a prototype for Cylon. Cylons should have a model, and should have an attack function, which will return the string \"Destroy all humans!\"\n\nSince some cylons appear human, then make a child object called HumanSkin. This should have a model, as Cylons do, and should have the same attack. However, it should also have a function called infiltrate, which will return the string \"Infiltrate the colonies\".",
