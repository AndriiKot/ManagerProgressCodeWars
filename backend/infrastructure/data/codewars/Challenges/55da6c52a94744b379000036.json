  "description": "Given a random string consisting of numbers, letters, symbols, you need to sum up the numbers in the string. \n\nNote:\n\n- Consecutive integers should be treated as a single number. eg, `2015` should be treated as a single number `2015`, NOT four numbers\n- All the numbers should be treaded as positive integer. eg, `11-14` should be treated as two numbers `11` and `14`. Same as `3.14`, should be treated as two numbers `3` and `14`\n- If no number was given in the string, it should return `0`\n\n\nExample:\n\n```\nstr = \"In 2015, I want to know how much does iPhone 6+ cost?\"\n```\n\n The numbers are `2015`, `6`\n\nSum is `2021`.\n",
