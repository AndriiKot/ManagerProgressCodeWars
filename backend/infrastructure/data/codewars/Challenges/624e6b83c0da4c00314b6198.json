  "description": "Your task is to calculate the runtime of an album given an array of the lengths of its tracks. The format used for the track lengths and the albun runtime is HH:MM:SS. The input lengths will always match this format and your output is expected to do the same.\nFor example, a track of 3 minutes and 16 seconds will be represented as 00:03:16.\n\nYou may assume that the album runtime will never exceed 99:59:59. If the album has no tracks, its runtime is 0 seconds.\n\n```javascript\nalbumLength([\"00:07:00\", \"00:07:23\", \"00:08:30\"]) //should return 00:22:53\nalbumLength([\"00:02:16\", \"00:10:34\", \"00:23:12\", \"00:00:53\", \"00:06:35\"]) //should return 00:43:30\n```",
