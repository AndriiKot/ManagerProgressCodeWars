  "description": "# Task\n John is new to spreadsheets. He is well aware of rows and columns, but he is not comfortable with spreadsheets numbering system.\n \n```\nSpreadsheet\t\tRow Column\nA1\t         \tR1C1\nD5\t\t         R5C4\nAA48       \t\tR48C27\nBK12\t\t       R12C63\n```\n\nSince John has a lot of work to do both in row-column and spreadsheet systems, he needs a program that converts cell numbers from one system to another.\n\n\n# Example\n\n For `s = \"A1\"`, the result should be `\"R1C1\"`.\n\n For `s = \"R48C27\"`, the result should be `\"AA48\"`.\n \n- Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` string `s`\n\n  The position (in spreadsheet or row-column numbering system).\n\n  `Spreadsheet : A1 to CRXO65535`\n  \n  `Row-Column: R1C1 to R65535C65535`\n  \n  \n - `[output]` a string\n\n  The position (in the opposite format; if input was in spreadsheet system, the output should be int row-column system, and vise versa).",
