  "description": "As you may know, once some people pass their teens, they jokingly only celebrate their 20th or 21st birthday, forever. With some maths skills, that's totally possible - you only need to select the correct number base!\n\nFor example, if they turn 32, that's exactly 20 - in base 16... Already 39? That's just 21, in base 19!\n\nYour task is to translate the given age to the much desired 20 (or 21) years, and indicate the number base, in the format specified below.\n\n**Note:** input will be always > 21\n\n\n### Examples:\n\n```\n32  -->  \"32? That's just 20, in base 16!\"\n39  -->  \"39? That's just 21, in base 19!\"\n```\n\n*Hint: if you don't know (enough) about [numeral systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system) and [radix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix), just observe the pattern!*\n\n---\n\n### My other katas\n\nIf you enjoyed this kata then please try [my other katas](https://www.codewars.com/users/anter69/authored)! :-)\n\n\n#### *Translations are welcome!*",
