  "description": "*This question is a variation on the [Arithmetic Progression kata]( https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-missing-term-in-an-arithmetic-progression)*\n\n---\n\nThe following was a question that I received during a technical interview for an entry level software developer position. I thought I'd post it here so that everyone could give it a go:\n\nYou are given an unsorted array containing all the integers from 0 to 100 inclusively. However, one number is missing. Write a function to find and return this number. What are the time and space complexities of your solution?\n",
