  "description": "We are interested in collecting the triples of positive integers ```(a, b, c)``` that fulfill the following equation:\n```python\na² + b² = c³\n```\nThe first triple with the lowest values that satisfies the equation we have above is (2, 2 ,2).\nIn effect:\n```python\n2² + 2² = 2³\n4  + 4  = 8\n```\nThe first pair of triples that \"shares\" the same value of ```c``` is: ```(2, 11, 5)``` and ```(5, 10, 5)```. \n\nBoth triples share the same value of ```c```  is ```c = 5```. \n```python\nTriple (2, 11, 5)                  Triple(5, 10, 5)\n2² + 11² =  5³                      5² +  10²  =  5³\n4  + 121 = 125                     25  + 100   = 125\n```\nSo, we say that the value ```c``` has two solutions because there are two triples sharing the same value of ```c```.\n\nThere are some values of ```c``` with no solutions.\n\nThe first value of ```c``` that have a surprising number of solutions is ```65``` with ```8``` different triples.\n\nIn order to avoid duplications you will consider that ```a <= b``` always.\n\nMake the function ```find_abc_sumsqcube()```, that may give us the values of c for an specific number of solutions.\n\nFor that purpose the above required function will receive two arguments, ```c_max``` and ```num_sol```. It is understandable that ```c_max``` will give to our function the upper limit of ```c``` and ```num_sol```, the specific number of solutions.\n\nThe function will output a sorted list with the values of ```c``` that have a number of solutions equals to ```num_sol```\n\nLet's see some cases: \n```python\nfind_abc_sumsqcube(5, 1) == [2] # below or equal to c_max = 5 we have triple the (2, 2, 2) (see above)\n\nfind_abc_sumsqcube(5, 2) == [5] # now we want the values of ```c ≤ c_max``` with two solutions (see above again)\n\nfind_abc_sumsqcube(10, 2) == [5, 10]\n\nfind_abc_sumsqcube(20, 8) == [] # There are no values of c equal and bellow 20 having 8 solutions.\n```\n\n\nOur tests will have the following ranges for our two arguments:\n```python\n5 ≤ c_max ≤ 1000\n1 ≤ num_sol ≤ 10\n```\nHappy coding!!",
