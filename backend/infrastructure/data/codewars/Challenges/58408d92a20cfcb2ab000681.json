  "description": "A landmass emerges from the ocean and you quickly go over and colonize it, with yourself as the ruler. As the new leader you divide the landmass into random zones as best you can. You decide you want a democracy and that each zone should have a number of representatives based on their population. However your meeting hall can only hold so many representatives. Given the population of each zone and the total number of representatives can you calculate how many representatives each zone gets?\n\n- Each zone will get at least one representative\n  - Use rounding, but if rounded to 0, the zone automatically get 1\n- You cannot have more/less than the number of representatives\n  - if the calculated number of representatives is less then the requirement the first zone with the fewest representatives gets an additional representative\n  - if the calculated number of representatives is more than the requirement the first zone with the most representatives loses a representative\n- Number of representatives will always be greater than or equal to the number of zones and less than the population",
