  "description": "Groups of characters decided to make a battle. Help them to figure out what group is more powerful. Create a function that will accept 2 variables and return the one who's stronger.\n\n### Rules\n\n* Each character has its own power:\n  ```\n    A = 1, B = 2, ... Y = 25, Z = 26\n    a = 0.5, b = 1, ... y = 12.5, z = 13\n  ```\n* Only alphabetical characters can and will participate in a battle.\n* Only two groups to a fight.\n* Group whose total power (`a + B + c + ...`) is bigger wins.\n* If the powers are equal, it's a tie.\n\n### Examples\n```\n\"One\", \"Two\"  -->  \"Two\"\n\"ONE\", \"NEO\"  -->  \"Tie!\"\n```\n\n### Related kata\n- [Battle of the characters (Easy)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/595519279be6c575b5000016)",
