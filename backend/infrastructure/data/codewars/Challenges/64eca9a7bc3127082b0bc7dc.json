  "description": "## Preamble\n\nIn Microsoft FreeCell (shipped with early Windows versions), each deal is generated by PRNG seeded by the deal number (see pseudocode below). There are 32000 deals numbered from 1 to 32000. This guarantees every deal is unique, but they are portable across computers, so #1 on one machine is exactly the same on other machines.\n\n## Your task\n\nYour task is to implement the function which accepts a deal number (`1 <= n <= 32000`) and returns an array/list/table (depending on programming language) of the cards corresponding to the given deal. See the dealing process below.\n\n## Initial deck\n\nThe initial deck is preloaded in `DECK` constant or variable (see example solution). It's array/list/table of 52 2-character strings (in the table below they are separated by spaces and not enclosed to quotes for readability purpose):\n```\nAC AD AH AS 2C 2D 2H 2S 3C 3D 3H 3S 4C\n4D 4H 4S 5C 5D 5H 5S 6C 6D 6H 6S 7C 7D\n7H 7S 8C 8D 8H 8S 9C 9D 9H 9S TC TD TH\nTS JC JD JH JS QC QD QH QS KC KD KH KS\n```\n\n## Pseudo random number generator\n\nThe algorithm used for shuffling the deck is linear congruential generator from early Microsoft C compiler, in pseudocode:\n```\nstate = deal_number\nloop {\n  state = (state * 214013 + 2531011) mod 2^31\n  next_value = floor[state / 2^16]\n}\n```\n\n## Dealing process\n\n1. Seed PRNG with the deal number.\n2. Take initial deck (see above) and use it for dealing cards. Initial indices are from 0 to 51.\n3. While the deck is not empty, do the following operations:\n* Generate next random number.\n* Choose the card index = `random number` mod `remaining deck length`.\n* If it's not the last card of the deck, swap the last card with the card at corresponding index of the deck.\n* Remove this card from the deck and deal it (put it on the table).\n* Repeat this procedure until all 52 cards are dealt.\n\nFor the simplicity, in this kata the table is represented by one dimentional array/list rather than 8 columns like in real FreeCell, in order the cards were placed (first row left to right, second row left to right, and so on).\n\n## Dealing process explained\n\nLet's explain how the dealing process works. For example, we will consider the deal number #1.\n\n* Create new PRNG and initialize it with `state = 1` (for other deals, use its number from the function argument instead of 1).\n* Make a copy of the initial deck (so the original one can be reused later for more deals).\n* Repeat the following steps until the deck is empty:\n* Generate new random number using the current state of PRNG. We modify the state variable and prepare it for the next number: `state = (1 * 214013 + 2531011) mod 2^31 = 2745024`. We divide our state by `2^16` (without modifying the state itself) and get integer part of it rounding down, which is `2745024 / 2^16 = 41`.\n* Calculate random number mod remaining deck length and take the corresponding card away from the deck, leaving empty the place where it was. In our example, we calculate `(41 mod 52) = 41`, and 41th card is `JD`, we deal this card.\n* The card we extracted from the deck was not the last one in the deck, so we get the last card in the deck and put it to the place where our dealt card was. After the first card, our remaining deck will be (we replaced our JD with KS):\n```\nAC AD AH AS 2C 2D 2H 2S 3C 3D 3H 3S 4C\n4D 4H 4S 5C 5D 5H 5S 6C 6D 6H 6S 7C 7D\n7H 7S 8C 8D 8H 8S 9C 9D 9H 9S TC TD TH\nTS JC(KS)JH JS QC QD QH QS KC KD KH\n```\n* Repeat the process, let's deal the second card:\n* We modify PRNG state again: `state = (2745024 * 214013 + 2531011) mod 2^31 = 1210316419`\n* Get the next random number value: `1210316419 / 2^16 = 18467`.\n* Calculate `(18467 mod 51) = 5` (becase we have only 51 cards left in the deck, `JD` was removed before).\n* Obtain card at index 5 of the deck which is `2D`.\n* Extract it from deck and replace with the last card in our deck:\n```\nAC AD AH AS 2C(KH)2H 2S 3C 3D 3H 3S 4C\n4D 4H 4S 5C 5D 5H 5S 6C 6D 6H 6S 7C 7D\n7H 7S 8C 8D 8H 8S 9C 9D 9H 9S TC TD TH\nTS JC KS JH JS QC QD QH QS KC KD\n```\n* Repeat this process until we deal the entire deck of 52 cards.\n* Return the resulting cards in order we dealt them.\n\n\n## Example deals\n\n```\nDeal #1:\nJD 2D 9H JC 5D 7H 7C 5H\nKD KC 9S 5S AD QC KH 3H\n2S KS 9D QD JS AS AH 3C\n4C 5C TS QH 4H AC 4D 7S\n3S TD 4S TH 8H 2C JH 7D\n6D 8S 8D QS 6C 3D 8C TC\n6S 9C 2H 6H\n\nDeal #11982:\nAH AS 4H AC 2D 6S TS JS\n3D 3H QS QC 8S 7H AD KS\nKD 6H 5S 4D 9H JH 9S 3C\nJC 5D 5C 8C 9D TD KH 7C\n6C 2C TH QH 6D TC 4S 7S\nJD 7D 8H 9C 2H QD 4C 5H\nKC 8D 2S 3S\n```\n\n## Little help for debugging\n\nIf you stuck implementing the right PRNG, here is an example of first 52 numbers generated if the PRNG is seeded with 1:\n```\n41, 18467, 6334, 26500, 19169, 15724, 11478, 29358, 26962, 24464, 5705, 28145, 23281, 16827, 9961, 491, 2995, 11942, 4827, 5436, 32391, 14604, 3902, 153, 292, 12382, 17421, 18716, 19718, 19895, 5447, 21726, 14771, 11538, 1869, 19912, 25667, 26299, 17035, 9894, 28703, 23811, 31322, 30333, 17673, 4664, 15141, 7711, 28253, 6868, 25547, 27644\n```",
