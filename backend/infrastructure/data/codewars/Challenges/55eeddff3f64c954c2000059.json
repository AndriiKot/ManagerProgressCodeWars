  "description": "You are given a list/array which contains only integers (positive and negative). Your job is to sum only the numbers that are the same and consecutive. The result should be one list.\n\nExtra credit if you solve it in one line. You can assume there is never an empty list/array and there will always be an integer. \n\nSame meaning: 1 == 1\n\n1 != -1\n\n#Examples:\n\n```\n[1,4,4,4,0,4,3,3,1] # should return [1,12,0,4,6,1]\n\n\"\"\"So as you can see sum of consecutives 1 is 1 \nsum of 3 consecutives 4 is 12 \nsum of 0... and sum of 2 \nconsecutives 3 is 6 ...\"\"\"\n\n[1,1,7,7,3] # should return [2,14,3]\n[-5,-5,7,7,12,0] # should return [-10,14,12,0]\n```",
