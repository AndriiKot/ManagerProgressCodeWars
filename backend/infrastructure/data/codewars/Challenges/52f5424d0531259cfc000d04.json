  "description": "## Task\n\nWrite a function which accepts a sequence of unique integers ( `0 <= x < 32` ) as an argument and returns a 32-bit integer such that the integer, in its binary representation, has `1` at only those indices, numbered from right to left, which are in the sequence.\n\n## Examples\n\n`[0, 1]  ->  3`  \n`[1, 2, 0, 4]  ->   23`  \n\nBecause `23` in binary is\n\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1\n                                              . . . . . 5 4 3 2 1 0  <-  indices\n                                                          ^   ^ ^ ^\n                                                          these bits are 1\n              due to the corresponding indices being in the given sequence\n\n## FAQ\n\nThe function name contains `sort` because this simulates [radix sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort).",
