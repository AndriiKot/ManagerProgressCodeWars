  "description": "# Relations : \n\nThe following challenge is partially related to two already existing Kata's. But is differnt in the sense that neither approach will work here and this is a more performance version as well. Links : \n\n[number1](https://www.codewars.com/kata/complete-the-pattern-number-9-diamond) , [number2](https://www.codewars.com/kata/give-me-a-diamond). OK last one maybe not.\n\n---\n\n# Challenge : \n\nYou are given an integer `n` as input. Your job is to create a diamond that is 2x the given number `n`.\n\n---\n\n# Input : \n\nInput is integer `n` and n > 2 ≤ 3000.\n\n---\n\n# Output :\n\nOutput will be a string and it will be in form of a diamond consisting of `+` with an addition line at the start showing `n` using `+`\n\n---\n\n# Examples :\n\n```\nD(3) :\n\n+++\n  +\n +++\n+++++\n+++++\n +++\n  +\n  \nD(5) :\n\n+++++\n    +\n   +++\n  +++++\n +++++++\n+++++++++\n+++++++++\n +++++++\n  +++++\n   +++\n    +\n\n```\n\n---\n\n# Restrictions :\n\nThis is **code-golf** so there is a limit. \n\nJavascript solutions are limited to less than 111 characters.\n\nPython solution are limited to less than 89 characters\n\nRuby solution are limited to less than 82 characters\n\nAll limits are exlusive ",
