  "description": "Welcome to our digital restaurant! Your role is to be a chef but for data, not food. Our special menu item today is 10 rows of data, served fresh from the PostgreSQL oven.\nAs a data chef, you have a table named `sample_table` with two columns, `a` and `b`. Column `a` contains `unique` positive (>=1) integer values, and column `b` contains single characters. The table can contain random amount of rows.\n\nThe recipe is tricky though: No matter the number of rows in the original table, your SQL query should always return exactly 10 rows! If there aren't enough rows in the table, you'll need to add some yourself, but with a twist. These extra rows should have 0 in column `a` and '-' in column `b`.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Your SQL query should always return exactly 10 rows, regardless of the number of rows available in the table.\n* If there are less than 10 rows in the table, the result should be filled with extra rows. These extra rows should have 0 in column A and '-' in column B. \n* If there are more than 10 rows in the table, your query should only return the first 10 rows.\n* The returned rows should be ordered by priority: rows from the original table first, followed by the extra rows, if any.\n* The rows from the original table should be sorted in ascending order according to column `a`\n\nGLHF!",
