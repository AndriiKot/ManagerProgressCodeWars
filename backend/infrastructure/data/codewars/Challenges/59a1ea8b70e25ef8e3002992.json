  "description": "You will be given the number of angles of a shape with equal sides and angles, and you need to return the number of its sides, and the measure of the interior angles.\n\nShould the number be equal or less than `2`, return:\n```\n\"this will be a line segment or a dot\"\n```\n\nOtherwise return the result in the following format:\n```\n\"This shape has s sides and each angle measures d\"\n```\n(replace `s` with number of sides and `d` with the measure of the interior angles).\n\nAngle measure should be **floored to the nearest integer**.\n\nNumber of sides will be tested from `0` to `180`.\n\nHave Fun!",
