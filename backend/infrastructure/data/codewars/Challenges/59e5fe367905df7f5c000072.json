  "description": "You are tasked with implementing a representation of [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number).\n\nStarting with the basics, we only require to be able to:\n- Extract the real and imaginary parts of a complex number\n- Add two complex numbers\n- Multiply two complex numbers\n\nSince complex numbers are, in fact, numbers, addition and multiplication should be implemented by overloading the operators + and * if your language supports it.",
