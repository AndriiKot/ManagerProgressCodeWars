  "description": "When a new member joins the `backend` team, we have a tradition. Instead of the usual monotonous introductions, we introduce ourselves in an alternating age order - the youngest goes first, followed by the oldest, then the second youngest, the second oldest, and so on. This rollercoaster of introductions creates a fun and friendly atmosphere, breaking the ice for the newcomer and making them feel at home from day one.\n\nWe have `employees` with the the following columns:\n\n* `employee_id`: A unique integer identifier for each employee.\n* `full_name`: A string representing the employee's full name.\n* `team`: A string that specifies which team the employee is part of. The team can be one of the following four: \"backend\", \"frontend\", \"devops\", or \"design\".\n* `birth_date`: A date that represents the employee's birthdate.\n\nYour task is to write a SQL query that will retrieve all employees from the 'backend' team, sorted according to this tradition. That is, they should be ordered by age in a unique alternating pattern: youngest first, then oldest, then second youngest, then second oldest, and so forth.\n\nYour query should return a result set with columns: `employee_id`, `full_name`, `team`, `birth_date`, ordered as per the described pattern.\n\n##### Notes:\n\n*  Let's assume for this task that there are no developers with the same `birth_date` - tests are written to ensure that no two employees have the same birth date. \n\nGLHF!\n\n### Desired Output\n\nThe desired output should look like this:\n\n<table><!----><tr><th>employee_id</th><th>full_name</th><th>team</th><th>birth_date</th></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Claris Kertzmann</td><td>backend</td><td>2004-04-11</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Venetta West V</td><td>backend</td><td>1971-05-17</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Tiara Breitenberg</td><td>backend</td><td>2002-02-16</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Ryan Harber</td><td>backend</td><td>1971-10-17</td></tr></table>\n...",
