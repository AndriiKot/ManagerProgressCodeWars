  "description": "In this Kata you make a converter.\nThis converter's input is a text in English, and it's output is the following.\n\n\"Hello, my name is bob!\" ->\n\"Olleh, ym eman si bob!\"\n\nAs you can see, it does more than just reverse the text. It reverses the words and keeps the location of the uppercase letter the same. \n\nAlso, special characters are located depending on it representing a abbreviation, is part of a word or is the start or finish of a sentence.\n\n\"Don't do this. I am from the F.B.I.\" ->\n\"T'nod od siht. I ma morf eht I.b.f.\"\n\nAlso, full caps is forbidden in our language, here is what happens to full caps text:\n\n\"HELLO, THIS IS FULL CAPS.\" ->\n\"Olleh, Siht Si Lluf Spac.\"\n\nYou get the idea. Good luck!",
