  "description": "We are given two arrays of integers A and B and we have to output a sorted array with the integers that fulfill the following constraints:\n\n- they are present in both ones\n\n- they occur more than once in A and more than once in B\n\n- their values are within a given range (inclusive)\n\n- they are odd or even according as it is requested\n\n## Example\n\nGiven two arrays, a range, and a wanted parity:\n``` python\narrA = [1, -2, 7, 2, 1, 3, 7, 1, 0, 2, 3]\narrB = [2, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 7, 7, 0]\nrng = [-4, 4] # is the range of the integers from -4 to 4 (inclusive)\nwanted = \"odd\"\n``` \n\nProcess to obtain the result:\n``` \n0, 1, 2, 3, 7, are the numbers present in arrA and arrB\n1, 2, 3, 7,  occur twice or more in arrA and arrB\n1, 2, 3,  are in the range [-4, 4]\n1, 3, are odd\noutput = [1, 3] \n``` \n\nFor the case:\n```python\narrA = [1, -2, 7, 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4]\narrB = [0, 4, 2, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 7, 7, 0, 4]\nrng = [-4, 4]\nwanted = \"even\"\noutput = [0, 2, 4] \n``` \n\nIf there are no elements that fulfill the constraints given above, the result will be an empty array.\n\nFeatures of the tests:\n```\nNumber of Random Tests = 300\nLength of the arrays A and B between 1000 and 10000\n```\n\nYou may assume that you will always receive valid entries for all the tests.\n\nEnjoy it!!",
