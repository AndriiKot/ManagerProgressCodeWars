  "description": "This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.\n\n`Point` objects have `x`, `y` attributes. `Triangle` objects have attributes `a`, `b`, `c` describing their corners, each of them is a `Point`.\n\nWrite a function calculating area of a `Triangle` defined this way.",
