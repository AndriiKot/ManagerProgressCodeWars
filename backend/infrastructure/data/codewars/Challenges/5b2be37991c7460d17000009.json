  "description": "We need you to implement a method of receiving commands over a network, processing the information and responding.\n\nOur device will send a single packet to you containing data and an instruction which you must perform before returning your reply.\n\nTo keep things simple, we will be passing a single \"packet\" as a string. \nEach \"byte\" contained in the packet is represented by 4 chars.\n\n\n\nOne packet is structured as below:\n```\nHeader  Instruction   Data1    Data2   Footer\n------   ------       ------   ------  ------\n H1H1     0F12         0012     0008    F4F4\n------   ------       ------   ------  ------\n\nThe string received in this case would be - \"H1H10F1200120008F4F4\"\n\nInstruction: The calculation you should perform, always one of the below.\n            0F12 = Addition\n            B7A2 = Subtraction\n            C3D9 = Multiplication\n            FFFF = This instruction code should be used to identify your return value.\n``` \n- The Header and Footer are unique identifiers which you must use to form your reply.\n\n- Data1 and Data2 are the decimal representation of the data you should apply your instruction to. _i.e 0109 = 109._\n\n- Your response must include the received header/footer, a \"FFFF\" instruction code, and the result of your calculation stored in Data1.\n\n- Data2 should be zero'd out to \"0000\".\n\n\n```\nTo give a complete example:\n\nIf you receive message \"H1H10F1200120008F4F4\".\nThe correct response would be \"H1H1FFFF00200000F4F4\"\n\n```\nIn the event that your calculation produces a negative result, the value returned should be \"0000\", similarly if the value is above 9999 you should return \"9999\".\n\n\nGoodluck, I look forward to reading your creative solutions!",
