  "description": "You are given a string \"strng\"\n\nPerform the following operation until \"strng\" becomes empty:\n\n    For every alphabet character from 'a' to 'z', remove the first occurrence of that character in \"strng\" (if it exists).\n\nExample, let initially strng = \"aabcbbca\". We do the following operations:\n\n    Remove the underlined characters strng = \"(a)a(b)(c)bbca\". The resulting string is strng = \"abbca\".\n\n    Remove the underlined characters strng = \"(a)(b)b(c)a\". The resulting string is strng = \"ba\".\n\n    Remove the underlined characters strng = \"(b)(a)\". The resulting string is strng = \"\".\n\n    Return the value of the string strng right before applying the last operation. In the example above, answer is \"ba\".\n\nYou can assume on next:\n\n    strng will never be empty\n\n    strng.length <= 5 * 10**5\n\n    strng will contains only of lowercase English letters.",
