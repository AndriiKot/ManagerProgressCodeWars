  "description": "# Be Concise IV - Index of an element in an array\n\n## Task\n\nProvided is a function ```Kata``` which accepts two parameters in the following order: ```array, element``` and ```return```s the **index** of the element if found and ```\"Not found\"``` otherwise.  Your task is to shorten the code as much as possible in order to meet the strict character count requirements of the Kata. (no more than 161) **You may assume that all array elements are unique.**",
