  "description": "Sample Space: all possible elementary outcomes of a trial.\n\nComplete the method that calculates the number of possible outcomes by using the fundamental counting principle.\n\nThe Fundamental counting Principle is: e.g. if a process requires 2 actions and the 1st action can be done in `x` ways and the 2nd action can be done in `y` ways, then the process can be done in `x*y` ways.\n\nIf the experiment consists of multiple trials, all possible combinations of outcomes of the trials must be specified as part of the sample space. \n\n## Examples\n\nConsider a coin, and a 6-sided die:\n* `coin = ['heads', 'tails']`\n* `d6 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`\n\n```ruby\n(coin, 2) == 4    # heads, heads; heads, tails; tails, heads; tails, tails\n\n(coin, 3) == 8    # heads, heads, heads\n                  # heads, heads, tails\n                  # heads, tails, heads\n                  # heads, tails, tails\n                  # tails, heads, heads\n                  # tails, heads, tails\n                  # tails, tails, heads\n                  # tails, tails, tails\n\n(d6, 1)   == 6    # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\n(d6, 2)   == 36   # (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), etc.\n```\n\n**Note:** multiple dice will be tested!
