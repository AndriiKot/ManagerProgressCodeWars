  "description": "# Squaredle solver\n## Introduction\n[Squaredle](https://squaredle.app/) is a game in which players find words by connecting letters up, down, left, right and diagonally. Each square in the puzzle can be used only once.\n\nThe purpose of this kata is to simulate a Squaredle player, finding all words in a puzzle.\n\n### Task\nWrite a function that returns a list of words, containing all words in a Squaredle puzzle.\n\nWords form a letter snake through the puzzle: each letter must be connected up, down, left, right or diagonally to its neighboring letters in the word. It is not allowed to move through missing squares.\n\nPay attention to the performance of your function.\n\n### Example\n```\n --- --- ---\n| c | d |   |         This puzzle contains 'code', 'cows', 'owed', 'wars' and 'codes'.\n --- --- ---\n| o |   | e |         It doesn't contain 'does' (no moving through missing squares).\n --- --- --- \n|   | w | s |         So given 'cd -o e- ws-ar ', your function should return\n --- --- ---\n| a | r |   |         ['code', 'cows', 'owed', 'wars', 'codes'].\n --- --- ---\n```\n\n### Input\nA string representation of the puzzle.\n* Puzzles are rectangular, but not necessarily square\n* Puzzles have ```2 <= r <= 10``` rows and ```2 <= c <= 10``` colums\n* Letters are in lower case ```a-z```\n* Rows are separated by a hyphen ```-```\n* Missing squares are denoted by a space ``` ```\n\n### Output\nA list of words.\n* Contains all words in the puzzle\n* Sorted by length, then alphabetically\n* If there are no words in the puzzle, return an empty list\n\n#### Words\nAll valid words for this kata are preloaded in the list ```WORDS```.\n* There are 14,460 valid words\n* Words are at least 4 letters\n* Words are in lower case",
