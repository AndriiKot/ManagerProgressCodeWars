  "description": "Given a string, return the minimal number of parenthesis reversals needed to make balanced parenthesis. \n\nFor example:\n```if-not:rust\n~~~\nsolve(\")(\") = 2 Because we need to reverse \")\" to \"(\" and \"(\" to \")\". These are 2 reversals. \nsolve(\"(((())\") = 1 We need to reverse just one \"(\" parenthesis to make it balanced.\nsolve(\"(((\") = -1 Not possible to form balanced parenthesis. Return -1.\n~~~\n```\n```if:rust\n~~~\nsolve(\")(\") = Some(2) // Because we need to reverse \")\" to \"(\" and \"(\" to \")\". These are 2 reversals. \nsolve(\"(((())\") = Some(1) // We need to reverse just one \"(\" parenthesis to make it balanced.\nsolve(\"(((\") = None // Not possible to form balanced parentheses.\n~~~\n```\n\nParenthesis will be either `\"(\"` or `\")\"`. \n\nMore examples in the test cases. \n\nGood luck.
