  "description": "Professor Chambouliard has just completed an experiment on gravitational waves.\nHe measures their effects on small magnetic particles. This effect is very small and negative. In his first experiment the effect satisfies the equation:\n\n`x**2 + 1e9 * x + 1 = 0`. \n\nProfessor C. knows how to solve equations of the form:\n\n`g(x) = a x ** 2 + b x + c = 0 (1)` \n\nusing the \"discriminant\".\n\n\nIt finds that the roots of `x**2 + 1e9 * x + 1 = 0` are `x1 = -1e9` and `x2 = 0`. The value of `x1` - good or bad - does not interest him because its absolute value is too big. \n\nOn the other hand, he sees immediately that the value of `x2` is not suitable!\n\nHe asks our help to solve equations of type (1) \nwith `a, b, c strictly positive numbers`, and `b being large (b >= 10 ** 9)`.\n\nProfessor C. will check your result `x2` (the smaller root in absolute value. Don't return the other root!) by reporting `x2` in (1) \nand seeing if `abs(g(x2)) < 1e-12`.\n\n#### Task: \n`solve(a, b, c)` \n\nthat will return the \"solution\" `x2` of (1) such as `abs(a * x2 ** 2 + b * x2 + c) < 1e-12`.\n\n#### Example: \nfor equation `7*x**2 + 0.40E+14 * x + 8 = 0` we can find: `x2 = -2e-13`\nwhich verifies `abs(g(x)) < 1e-12`.\n",
