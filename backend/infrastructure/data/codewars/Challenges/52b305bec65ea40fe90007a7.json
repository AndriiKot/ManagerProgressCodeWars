  "description": "Pirates have notorious difficulty with enunciating. They tend to blur all the letters together and scream at people.\n\nAt long last, we need a way to unscramble what these pirates are saying.\n\nWrite a function that will accept a jumble of letters as well as a dictionary, and output a list of words that the pirate might have meant.\n\nFor example:\n```\ngrabscrab( \"ortsp\", [\"sport\", \"parrot\", \"ports\", \"matey\"] )\n```\n\nShould return `[\"sport\", \"ports\"]`.\n\nReturn matches in the same order as in the dictionary. Return an empty array if there are no matches.\n\nGood luck!\n\n",
