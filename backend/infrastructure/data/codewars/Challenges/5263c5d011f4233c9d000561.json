  "description": "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence):\n\nIn mathematics, the look-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:\n\n```\n1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, …\n```\n\nTo generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit. For example:\n\n```\n1 is read off as \"one 1\" or 11.\n11 is read off as \"two 1s\" or 21.\n21 is read off as \"one 2, then one 1\" or 1211.\n1211 is read off as \"one 1, then one 2, then two 1s\" or 111221.\n111221 is read off as \"three 1s, then two 2s, then one 1\" or 312211.\n```\n\n---\n\n\nYour mission is to write a function which, given an integer `n` as parameter, returns a comma separated list of the first `n` terms of the sequence. For `0`, an empty string shall be returned.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\n2  -->  \"1,11\"\n3  --> \"1,11,21\"\n5  --> \"1,11,21,1211,111221\"\n```",
