  "description": "# Task\n There are some Bots works in CodeFights Company. Each CodeFights Company Bot is trained by engineers from that specific company. The way it works is that a representative group of engineers from each company is identified as trainers before the bot goes live, and they CodeFight against the bot during a training phase. The current training algorithm is definitely more complex, but let's assume it works this way:\n \n```\nFor each trainer we collect two pieces of information per task\n[answerTime, correctness], \nwhere correctness is 1 if the answer was correct,\n                      -1 if the answer was wrong, \n                   and 0 if no answer was given.\n```\n\n In this case, the bot's correct answer time for a given task would be the average of the answer times from the trainers who answered correctly. Given all of the training information for a specific task, calculate the bot's answer time.\n\n# Example\n\nFor\n```\ntrainingData = [[3, 1],\n                [6, 1],\n                [4, 1],\n                [5, 1]]\n```\nthe output should be `4.5`.\n\n All four trainers have solved the task correctly, so the answer is `(3 + 6 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 4.5`.\n\nFor\n```\ntrainingData = [[4, 1],\n                [4, -1],\n                [0, 0],\n                [6, 1]]\n```\nthe output should be `5.0`.\n\n Only the `1st` and the `4th` trainers (1-based) submitted correct solutions, so the answer is `(4 + 6) / 2 = 5.0`.\n\nFor\n```\ntrainingData = [[4, -1],\n                [0, 0],\n                [5, -1]]\n```\nthe output should be `0`.\n\nNo correct answers were given for the task.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` 2D integer array `trainingData`\n\n  The i<sup>th</sup> element of trainingData contains exactly 2 elements:\n  \n  `trainingData[i][0]` is the answer time for the ith person and `trainingData[i][1]` is correctness.\n\n  If a trainer answered correctly, then correctness equals 1;\n  \n  If a trainer answered incorrectly, then correctness equals -1;\n  \n  If a trainer didn't give any answer, answerTime and correctness both equal to 0.\n  \n  Constraints:\n\n  `1 ≤ trainingData.length ≤ 50.`\n\n  `0 ≤ trainingData[i][0] ≤ 100.`\n\n  `-1 ≤ trainingData[i][1] ≤ 1.`\n\n\n - `[output]` a float value\n\n    The time the bot will take to solve a specific task. Return `0` if none of the trainers answered correctly. Your output will be considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed `10`<sup>-5</sup> compared to our tests.",
