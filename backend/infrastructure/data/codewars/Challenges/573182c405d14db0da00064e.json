  "description": "A natural number is called **k-prime** if it has exactly k prime factors, counted with multiplicity. A natural number is thus prime if and only if it is 1-prime.\n```\nExamples:\nk = 2 -> 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, …\nk = 3 -> 8, 12, 18, 20, 27, 28, 30, …\nk = 5 -> 32, 48, 72, 80, 108, 112, …\n```\n#### Task:\n\nGiven an integer `k` and a list `arr` of positive integers the function `consec_kprimes (or its variants in other languages)` returns\nhow many times in the sequence `arr` numbers come up twice in a row with exactly `k` prime factors? \n\n#### Examples:\n```\narr = [10005, 10030, 10026, 10008, 10016, 10028, 10004]\nconsec_kprimes(4, arr) => 3 because 10005 and 10030 are consecutive 4-primes, 10030 and 10026 too as well as 10028 and 10004 but 10008 and 10016 are 6-primes.\n\nconsec_kprimes(4, [10175, 10185, 10180, 10197]) => 3 because 10175-10185 and 10185- 10180 and 10180-10197 are all consecutive 4-primes.\n\n```\n\n#### Note:\n\nIt could be interesting to begin with:\n<https://www.codewars.com/kata/k-primes>\n",
