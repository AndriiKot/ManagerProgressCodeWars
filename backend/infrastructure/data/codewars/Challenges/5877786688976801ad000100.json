  "description": "You're given a string containing a sequence of words separated with whitespaces. Let's say it is a sequence of patterns: a name and a corresponding number - like this:\n\n```\"red 1 yellow 2 black 3 white 4\"```\n\nYou want to turn it into a different **string** of objects you plan to work with later on - like this:\n\n```\"[{name : 'red', id : '1'}, {name : 'yellow', id : '2'}, {name : 'black', id : '3'}, {name : 'white', id : '4'}]\"```\n\nDoing this manually is a pain. So you've decided to write a short function that would make the computer do the job for you. Keep in mind, the pattern isn't necessarily a word and a number. Consider anything separeted by a whitespace, just don't forget: an array of objects with two elements: name and id.\n\nAs a result you'll have a string you may just copy-paste whenever you feel like defining a list of objects - now without the need to put in names, IDs, curly brackets, colon signs, screw up everything, fail searching for a typo and begin anew. This might come in handy with large lists.\n",
