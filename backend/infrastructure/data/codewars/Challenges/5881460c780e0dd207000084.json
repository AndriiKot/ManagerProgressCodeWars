  "description": "This kata is part of the collection [Mary's Puzzle Books](https://www.codewars.com/collections/marys-puzzle-books).\n\nMary brought home a \"spot the differences\" book. The book is full of a bunch of problems, and each problem consists of two strings that are similar. However, in each string there are a few characters that are different. An example puzzle from her book is:\n```\nString 1: \"abcdefg\"\nString 2: \"abcqetg\"\n```\nNotice how the \"d\" from String 1 has become a \"q\" in String 2, and \"f\" from String 1 has become a \"t\" in String 2.\n\nIt's your job to help Mary solve the puzzles. Write a program `spot_diff`/`Spot` that will compare the two strings and return a list with the positions where the two strings differ. In the example above, your program should return `[3, 5]` because String 1 is different from String 2 at positions 3 and 5.\n\nNOTES:\n\n```if-not:csharp\n• If both strings are the same, return `[]`\n```\n```if:csharp\n• If both strings are the same, return `new List<int>()`\n```\n\n• Both strings will always be the same length\n\n• Capitalization and punctuation matter",
