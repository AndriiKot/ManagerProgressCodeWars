  "description": "You are the greatest chef on earth. No one boils eggs like you! Your restaurant is always full of guests, who love your boiled eggs. But when there is a greater order of boiled eggs, you need some time, because you have only one pot for your job. How much time do you need?\n\n## Your Task\n\nImplement a function, which takes a non-negative integer, representing the number of eggs to boil. It must return the time in minutes (integer), which it takes to have all the eggs boiled.\n\n## Rules\n\n* you can put at most 8 eggs into the pot at once\n* it takes 5 minutes to boil an egg\n* we assume, that the water is boiling all the time (no time to heat up)\n* for simplicity we also don't consider the time it takes to put eggs into the pot or get them out of it\n\n## Example (Input --> Output)\n\n```\n0 --> 0\n5 --> 5\n10 --> 10\n```\n\n",
