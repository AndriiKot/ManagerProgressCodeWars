  "description": "You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from `green`, to `yellow`, to `red`, and then to `green` again. \n\nComplete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.\n\nFor example, when the input is `green`, output should be `yellow`.\n\n```if:c\nIn C the state of the light is represented by an `enum`, not a string.\n```",
