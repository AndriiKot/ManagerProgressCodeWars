  "description": "# Task:\n\nWe define the \"self reversed power sequence\" as one shown below:\n\n```math\n\\\\ S(0) = 0\n\\\\ S(1) = 1\n\\\\ S(2) = 1^2 + 2 = 3\n\\\\ S(3) = 1^3 + 2^2 + 3 = 8\n\\\\ S(4) = 1^4 + 2^3 + 3^2 + 4 = 22\n\\\\ S(5) = 1^5 + 2^4 + 3^3 + 4^2 + 5 = 65\n\\\\ ...\n\\\\ S(n) = 1^n + 2^{n-1} + ... + (n-1)^2 + n\n```\n\n<!--\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/5PwwTaz.jpg\">\n-->\n\n\nImplement a function that takes 2 arguments (`ord max` and `num dig`), and finds the smallest term of the sequence whose index is less than or equal to `ord max`, and has exactly `num dig` number of digits.\n\nIf there is a number with correct amount of digits, the result should be an array in the form:\n\n```javascript\n[true, smallest found term]\n[false, -1]\n```\n```python\n[True, smallest found term]\n[False, -1]\n```\n```ruby\n[true, smallest found term]\n[false, -1]\n```\n\n## Input range:\n\n```javascript\nordMax <= 500\n```\n```python\nord_max <= 1000\n```\n```ruby\nord_max <= 1000\n```\n\n___\n\n## Examples:\n\n```javascript\nminLengthNum(5, 10) === [true, 10]   // 10th term has 5 digits\nminLengthNum(7, 11) === [false, -1]  // no terms before the 13th one have 7 digits\nminLengthNum(7, 14) === [true, 13]   // 13th term is the first one which has 7 digits\n```\n```python\nmin_length_num(5, 10) == [True, 10]   # 10th term has 5 digits\nmin_length_num(7, 11) == [False, -1]  # no terms before the 13th one have 7 digits\nmin_length_num(7, 14) == [True, 13]   # 13th term is the first one which has 7 digits\n```\n```ruby\nmin_length_num(5, 10) == [true, 10]   # 10th term has 5 digits\nmin_length_num(7, 11) == [false, -1]  # no terms before the 13th one have 7 digits\nmin_length_num(7, 14) == [true, 13]   # 13th term is the first one which has 7 digits\n```\n\nWhich you can see in the table below:\n\n```\nn-th Term    Term Value\n1              0\n2              1\n3              3\n4              8\n5              22\n6              65\n7              209\n8              732\n9              2780\n10             11377\n11             49863\n12             232768\n13             1151914\n14             6018785\n```\n\n___\n\nEnjoy it and happy coding!!",
