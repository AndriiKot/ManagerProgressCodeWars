  "description": "[Generala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generala) is a dice game popular in South America. It's very similar to [Yahtzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee) but with a different scoring approach. It is played with 5 dice, and the possible results are:\n\n| Result        | Points | Rules                                                                                                                                          | Samples                            |\n|---------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| GENERALA      | 50     | When all rolled dice are of the same value.                                                                                                    | 66666, 55555, 44444, 11111, 22222, 33333.  |\n| POKER         | 40     | Four rolled dice are of the same value.                                                                                                        | 44441, 33233, 22262.               |\n| FULLHOUSE     | 30     | Three rolled dice are of the same value, the remaining two are of a different value, but equal among themselves.                               | 12121, 44455, 66116.               |\n| STRAIGHT      | 20     | Rolled dice are in sequential order. Dice with value `1` is a wildcard that can be used at the beginning of the straight before a `2`, or at the end of it after a `6`. | 12345, 23456, 34561, 13654, 62534. |\n| Anything else | 0      | Anything else will return `0` points.                                                                                                          | 44421, 61623, 12346.               |\n\nPlease note that dice are not in order; for example `12543` qualifies as a `STRAIGHT`. Also, No matter what string value you get for the dice, you can always reorder them any order you need to make them qualify as a `STRAIGHT`. I.E. `12453`, `16543`, `15364`, `62345` all qualify as valid `STRAIGHT`s.\n\n\n\nComplete the function that is given the rolled dice as a string of length `5` and return the points scored in that roll. You can safely assume that provided parameters will be valid:\n\n * String of length 5,\n * Each character will be a number between `1` and `6`\n\n",
