  "description": "In this Kata, we are going to determine if the count of each of the characters in a string can be equal if we remove a single character from that string.\n\nFor example:\n```\nsolve('abba') = false -- if we remove any character, the count of each character will not be equal.\nsolve('abbba') = true -- if we remove one b, the count of each character becomes 2.\nsolve('aaaa') = true -- if we remove one character, the remaining characters have same count.\nsolve('wwwf') = true -- if we remove f, the remaining letters have same count.\n```\nMore examples in the test cases. Empty string is not tested.\n\nGood luck!",
