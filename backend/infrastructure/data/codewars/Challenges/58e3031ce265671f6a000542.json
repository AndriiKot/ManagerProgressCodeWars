  "description": "This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.\n\nPoint objects have `x`, `y` attributes.\nCircle objects have `center` which is a `Point`, and `radius` which is a number.\n\nWrite a function calculating distance between `Circle a` and `Circle b`.\n\nIf they're overlapping or one is completely within the other, just return zero.\n\nTests round answers to 6 decimal places, so you don't need to round them yourselves.",
