  "description": "Similar but fairly harder version : [Linked](https://www.codewars.com/kata/540d0fdd3b6532e5c3000b5b)\n\nCreate a function that takes a integer number `n` and returns the formula for `$(a+b)^n$` as a string. (**Input --> Output**)\n\n```\n0  --> \"1\"\n1  --> \"a+b\"\n2  --> \"a^2+2ab+b^2\"\n-2 --> \"1/(a^2+2ab+b^2)\"\n3  --> \"a^3+3a^2b+3ab^2+b^3\"\n5  --> \"a^5+5a^4b+10a^3b^2+10a^2b^3+5ab^4+b^5\"\n```\n\nThe formula for `n=5` is like so : \n\n```math\na^5 + 5a^4b+10a^3b^2+10a^2b^3+5ab^4+b^5\n```\nSo the answer would look like so : `a^5+5a^4b+10a^3b^2+10a^2b^3+5ab^4+b^5`\n\n\n# Important notes : \n\n- Your string may not have spaces so you can't do this : `a^5 + 5a^4 b + 10a^3 b^2...`\n- You will show raised to power of by `^` and not using `**`. \n- You need not put `*` between each multiplication\n- There is no need to show `a^1` or `b^1` since that is basically `a` and `b`\n- `a^0` and/or `b^0` also don't need be shown instead be a normal person and use `1` since that is what they equate to.\n- You will need to handle both `positive and negative numbers + 0` \n- Note  : \n     - ```math\n      a^{-n} = \\frac 1{a^n}\n     ```\n- You will not be tested for float (only negative integers and whole numbers)\n- input `n` goes from -200 to 200.\n\n```if:java,javascript\nYou will need to use BigInt since otherewise it will not work for both JS and Java\n```\n\n```if:c\nIn C you will not have to deal with numbers that cannot fit in an unsigned 64 bits integer.\n```",
