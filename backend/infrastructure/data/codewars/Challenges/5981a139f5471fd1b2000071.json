  "description": "There are five workers : `James`, `John`, `Robert`, `Michael` and `William`. They work in a fixed order from Monday to Friday, and they rest on weekends. The order of work is as follows:\n\n* `James` works on `Monday`,\n\n* `John` works on `Tuesday`,\n\n* `Robert` works on `Wednesday`,\n\n* `Michael` works on `Thursday`,\n\n* `William` works on `Friday`.\n\nYour task is to create a function that takes three arguments:\n\n* **Weekday**: The day of the week (e.g., `Monday`).\n\n* **Number of Trees**: The number of trees that must be sprayed on that day.\n\n* **Cost per Litre**: The cost of 1 litre of liquid needed to spray a tree. Assume that 1 tree requires 1 litre of liquid.\n\nThe total cost of the liquid to spray all trees is denoted as `x`.\n\nThe function should return a string in the following format: \n\n`'It is (weekday) today, (name), you have to work, you must spray (number) trees and you need (x) dollars to buy liquid'`\n\n## Examples:\n\n**Input** : \n\n* **Weekday**         : `\"Monday\"`.\n\n* **Number of Trees** : `15`\n\n* **Cost per Litre**  : `2`\n\n**Output**: \n\n`\"It is Monday today, James, you have to work, you must spray 15 trees and you need 30 dollars to buy liquid.\"`\n\n\n",
