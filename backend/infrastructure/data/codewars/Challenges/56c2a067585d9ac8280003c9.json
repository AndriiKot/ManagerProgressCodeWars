  "description": "Consider a matchmaking system which asks developers for their skills. This includes all the skills a developer has used in the past, desires to continue to use, and would like to avoid. A candidate has many `skills`, one may look like this: \n\n```javascript\n{\n  name: 'JavaScript',\n  experience: 7, // in years \n  preference: 'desired' // could be desired, neutral or avoid\n}\n```\n\nOn the flip side, the company can create a job with skill requirements. Many companies are just looking for bright developers, so Strive also encourages the use of substitute skills. For example, a company can configure 3 years of JavaScript to substitute for 3 years of CoffeeScript. A job has many `skills`, one may look like this: \n\n```javascript\n{\n  name: 'CoffeeScript',\n  idealYears: 3, // in years\n  substitutions: [{\n    name: 'JavaScript'\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nA job skill can be satisfied if the candidate's years experience with the skill is greater than or equal to the ideal years. For a valid match, all job skills must be satisfied by the candidate's skills. Additionally, if the candidate desires to use the skill, that skill can recieve a 50% experience boost. **However, if the candidate wants to avoid a primary (non-substitute) job skill that a company requires the match is invalid.** At that point, there is no need to check for valid substitutions. \n\nCreate a method `match(candidate, job)` that will take a candidate and a job and return a boolean indicating if it is a valid match.\n\n---\n\nCheck out the previous Kata:\n\n- [Strive Matching #1][3]\n- [Strive Matching #2][2]\n\n[3]:http://www.codewars.com/kata/strive-matching-number-1\n[2]:http://www.codewars.com/kata/strive-matching-number-2",
