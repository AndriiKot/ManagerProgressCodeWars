  "description": "Hi!\n\nWell, you probably already are familiar with hashes. But, well, I want to access hash values through a diferent way, I really do not like to use the `[]` method.\n\nHere's how I want to access the values:\n\n```ruby\nhash = {a: 2, b: 1, c: 0.5}\n\nhash.a # must return the same as hash[:a]\nhash.b # must return the same as hash[:b]\nhash.c # must return the same as hash[:c]\n```\n\nBut there is some things that you may be aware:\n\n- If the hash already has a method with the key name, the existent method must be kept (e.g. `{size: 5}.size` must return the hash size, and not the value)\n- If the hash doens't include the key, you must return the that call an inexistent method in hash (e.g. `hash = {a: 1}; hash.b` must throw the `NoMethodError` exception)\n- String keys should work as well (e.g. `{'a' => 'b'}.a` must return `'b'`)\n\nSome tips:\n\n- You must reopen the `Hash` class\n- Try to do with the less code as possible",
