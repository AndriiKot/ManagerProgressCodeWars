  "description": "# Task\n\nYou are a magician. You're going to perform a trick.\n\nYou have `b` black marbles and `w` white marbles in your magic hat, and an infinite supply of black and white marbles that you can pull out of nowhere. \n\nYou ask your audience to repeatedly remove a pair of marbles from your hat and, for each pair removed, you add one marble to the hat according to the following rule, until there is only 1 marble left. \n\nIf the marbles of the pair that is removed are of the same color, you add a white marble to the hat. Otherwise, if one is black and one is white, you add a black marble.\n\nGiven the initial number of black and white marbles in your hat, your trick is to predict the color of the last marble.\n\nNote: A magician may confuse your eyes, but not your mind ;-)\n\n# Input/Output\n\n- `[input]` integer `b`\n\nInitial number of black marbles in the hat. \n\n`1 <= b <= 10^9`\n\n- `[input]` integer `w`\n\nInitial number of white marbles in the hat. \n\n`1 <= w <= 10^9`\n\n- `[output]` a string\n\n`\"Black\"` or `\"White\"` if you can safely predict the color of the last marble. If not, return `\"Unsure\"`.\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n# Encodings\n\n* purity: `LetRec`\n* numEncoding: `BinaryScott`\n* output: `Unsure`, `Black` or `White` ( not strings! ); these values have been `Preloaded` for you\n~~~",
