  "description": "The prime factorization of a positive integer is a list of the integer's prime factors, together with their multiplicities; the process of determining these factors is called integer factorization. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic says that every positive integer has a single unique prime factorization.\n\nThe prime factorization of 24, for instance, is (2^3) * (3^1).\n\n~~~if:java\nWrite a class called `PrimeFactorizer` whose constructor takes no arguments and has an instance method `factor` accepting exactly 1 `long` which returns a `Map<Long, Integer>` where the keys are prime numbers and the values are the multiplicities.\n~~~\n~~~if:ruby\nWithout using the prime library, write a class called `PrimeFactorizer` whose constructor accepts exactly 1 integer and has an instance method `factor` returning a hash where the keys are prime numbers and the values are the multiplicities.\n~~~\n~~~if:javascript\nWrite a class called `PrimeFactorizer` whose constructor accepts exactly 1 number (a positive integer) and has a property `factor` containing an object where the keys are prime numbers **as strings** and the values are the multiplicities.\n~~~\n~~~if:python\nWrite a class called `PrimeFactorizer` (inheriting directly from `object`) whose constructor accepts exactly 1 `int` and has a property `factor` containing a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are the multiplicities.\n~~~\n~~~if:objc\nWrite a function `prime_factors` accepting exactly 1 `long long` and returns a dictionary (i.e. `NSDictionary *`) where the keys are prime numbers **as strings** (i.e. `NSString *`) and the values are the multiplicities are `NSNumber *`s representing integers.\n~~~\n\n```ruby\nPrimeFactorizer.new(24).factor #should return { 2 => 3, 3 => 1 }\n```\n```python\nPrimeFactorizer(24).factor #should return { 2: 3, 3: 1 }\n```\n```javascript\nnew PrimeFactorizer(24).factor //should return { '2': 3, '3': 1 }\n```\n```java\nnew PrimeFactorizer().factor(24) //should return { 2 => 3, 3 => 1 }\n```\n```objc\nprime_factors(24); // => @{@\"2\": @3, @\"3\": @1}\n```\n",
