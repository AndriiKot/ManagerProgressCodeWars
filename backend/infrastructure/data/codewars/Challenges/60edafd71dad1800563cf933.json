  "description": "# Closure Counter\n- Define the function **counter** that returns a function that returns an increasing value.\n- The first value should be 1.\n- You're going to have to use closures.\n\n\n#### Example:\n> - const newCounter = counter();  \n> - newCounter() // 1  \n> - newCounter() // 2\n\n## Closure:\n> A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures",
