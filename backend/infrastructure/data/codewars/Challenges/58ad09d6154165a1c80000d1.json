  "description": "You have a string that consists of zeroes and ones. Now choose any two *adjacent* positions in the string: if one of them is `0`, and the other one is `1`, remove these two digits from the string.\n\nReturn the length of the resulting (smallest) string that you can get after applying this operation multiple times?\n\n**Note:** after each operation, the remaining digits are separated by spaces and thus *not* adjacent anymore - see the examples below.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n For `\"01010\"` the result should be `1`:\n \n```python\n\"01010\"  -->  \"  010\"  -->  \"    0\"\n```\n \n \n For `\"110100\"` the result should be `2`:\n\n```python\n\"110100\"  -->  \"1  100\"  -->  \"1    0\"\n```\n\n\n## Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` string `s`\n\n  The initial string.\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\n  The minimum length of the string that may remain after applying the described operations as many times as possible.\n",
