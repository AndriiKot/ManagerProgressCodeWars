  "description": "You are to write a function (biggest_gold_piece) which, given a few pieces of soil with gold in it will return the piece with the most gold.\n\nThe input of the function is a string containing one or more pieces of soil. Each piece is delimited by punctuation, so for instance the string ```\"ergreg,  ; cdrg.\" ``` has three pieces: ```\"ergreg\"```, ```\" \"``` and ```\" cdrg\"```.\n\nA piece of gold is defined as the character 'G' (case insensitive) followed by its weight, so that the piece ```\"we G5r\"``` weighs 5.\n\nIf multiple golds are found in one piece of soil they should be added together, so that the following piece of soil ```\"g5 g5; sdg g44\"``` has two pieces of soil, both containing gold, with respective values of 10 and 44.\n\nThe function should return the piece with most gold in it, in its raw state (as a string). For example, ```biggest_gold_piece(\"null, g55 dds; G43w\")``` should return ```\" g55 dds\"``` as this is the piece of soil with most gold (55).\n\n###Expected Input\nYou can assume that the input will always be a string with at least one piece of soil containing gold.\n\nGood Luck!",
