  "description": "**1. - You are given an array of positive integers as argument. You must generate all the possible divisions between each pair of its elements that outputs an integer value.**\n\nFor example:\n```\narr = [2, 4, 27, 16, 9, 15, 25, 6, 12, 83, 24, 49, 7, 5, 94, 12, 6]\n```\nYou must then create a list, sorted by the quotient value, containing the corresponding numerator and denominator taken from the given array.\n```python\nFormat: (quotient, (numerator, denominator))\n\n[(2, (4, 2)), (2, (12, 6)), (2, (12, 6)), (2, (12, 6)), (2, (12, 6)), (2, (24, 12)), (2, (24, 12)), (3, (6, 2)), (3, (6, 2)), (3, (12, 4)), (3, (12, 4)), (3, (15, 5)), (3, (27, 9)), (4, (16, 4)), (4, (24, 6)), (4, (24, 6)), (5, (25, 5)), (6, (12, 2)), (6, (12, 2)), (6, (24, 4)), (7, (49, 7)), (8, (16, 2)), (12, (24, 2)), (47, (94, 2))]\n```\n```ruby\nFormat: [quotient, [numerator, denominator]]\n\n[[2, [4, 2]], [2, [12, 6]], [2, [12, 6]], [2, [12, 6]], [2, [12, 6]], [2, [24, 12]], [2, [24, 12]], [3, [6, 2]], [3, [6, 2]], [3, [12, 4]], [3, [12, 4]], [3, [15, 5]], [3, [27, 9]], [4, [16, 4]], [4, [24, 6]], [4, [24, 6]], [5, [25, 5]], [6, [12, 2]], [6, [12, 2]], [6, [24, 4]], [7, [49, 7]], [8, [16, 2]], [12, [24, 2]], [47, [94, 2]]]\n```\n\n**2. - Eliminate all the duplicated cases giving it only once.**\n\n```(2, (12, 6))``` occurs four times, for example (we have more cases) \n\nThe data is reduced to:\n```python\n[(2, (4, 2)), (2, (12, 6)), (2, (24, 12)), (3, (6, 2)), (3, (12, 4)), (3, (15, 5)), (3, (27, 9)), (4, (16, 4)), (4, (24, 6)), (5, (25, 5)), (6, (12, 2)), (6, (24, 4)), (7, (49, 7)), (8, (16, 2)), (12, (24, 2)), (47, (94, 2))]\n```\n```ruby\n[[2, [4, 2]], [2, [12, 6]], [2, [24, 12]], [3, [6, 2]], [3, [12, 4]], [3, [15, 5]], [3, [27, 9]], [4, [16, 4]], [4, [24, 6]], [5, [25, 5]], [6, [12, 2]], [6, [24, 4]], [7, [49, 7]], [8, [16, 2]], [12, [24, 2]], [47, [94, 2]]]\n```\n\n**3. - Select the quotients that are higher or equal than a certain given value.**\n\nIf the given value is 6 will reduce even more our cases:\n```python\n[(6, (12, 2)), (6, (24, 4)), (7, (49, 7)), (8, (16, 2)), (12, (24, 2)), (47, (94, 2))]\n```\n```ruby\n[[6, [12, 2]], [6, [24, 4]], [7, [49, 7]], [8, [16, 2]], [12, [24, 2]], [47, [94, 2]]]\n```\n\n**4. - Select the results by even or odd quotient value.**\n\nSupose that we are interested in odd values only, we will finally have:\n```python\n[(7, (49, 7)), (47, (94, 2))]\n```\n```ruby\n[[7, [49, 7]], [47, [94, 2]]]\n```\nSo our function ```sel_quot()``` may receive the following the arguments in the following order outputting the corresponding result:\n```python\n# same array as above, arr\ndir_str = 'odd'\nsel_quot(arr, 6, dir_str) == [(7, (49, 7)), (47, (94, 2))] # \n```\n```ruby\n# same array as above, arr\nsel_quot(arr, 6, 'odd') == [[7, [49, 7]], [47, [94, 2]]]\n```\n\nOur function should be able to receive only an array and the integer value. (Without doing the even/odd selection)\n```python\n# same array, arr\nsel_quot(arr, 6) == [(6, (12, 2)), (6, (24, 4)), (7, (49, 7)), (8, (16, 2)), (12, (24, 2)), (47, (94, 2))]\n```\n```ruby\n# same array, arr\nsel_quot(arr, 6) == [[6, [12, 2]], [6, [24, 4]], [7, [49, 7]], [8, [16, 2]], [12, [24, 2]], [47, [94, 2]]]\n```\n\nAssumptions:\nAll integer values in the array, including ```m```,  will be >= 2.\n\nThe strings will be exactly given as 'even' and 'odd' or 'Even' and 'Odd'.\n\nHave a good time!\n\n",
