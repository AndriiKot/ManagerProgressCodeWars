  "description": "**Task**\n\nYour task is to create a function that calculates acceleration based on various motion-related variables and equations.\n\n**Variables (given as floats)**\n - s: Displacement in meters (m)\n - u: Initial velocity in meters per second (m/s)\n - v: Final velocity in meters per second (m/s)\n - t: Time in seconds (s)\n \n **Relevant Equations (rearrange to find a)**\n - v = u + at\n - s = ut + 0.5 * (at²)\n - s = vt - 0.5 * (at²)\n - v² = u² + 2as\n\n**Output**\n\nWhen given 3 of the 4 variables (in a random order) your function must use the correct equation to calculate the acceleration based on the inputs given and return the acceleration value, or -1 if it encounters an error case\n\nExpress your acceleration value rounded to 1 d.p - `e.g 2.5`.\n\n**Error Cases**\n\n - t is less than or equal to 0\n - more or less than 3 variables are given\n - s is 0 in a case where s, u and v are given\n \n**Assumptions**\n\n You can assume any variables you are given will be floats in the range:\n \n -100 < variables < 100\n\n\n**More Info**\n\nFor more information, you can visit the sites below:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion#Constant_translational_acceleration_in_a_straight_line\n\nhttps://wikieducator.org/OpenMaths/Algebra/Rearranging_Equations\n",
