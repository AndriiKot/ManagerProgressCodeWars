  "description": "A byte is a sequence of 8 bits. One could imagine implementing a small set data structure using a single byte. The set would hold at most the elements 0 through 7. The value of each bit in the byte would indicate whether the index of that bit was included in the set.\n\nConsider the following byte, where the index of each bit is marked below.\n\nByte:  0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1\n\nIndex: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nThis byte would represent the set {1, 2, 5, 7}. Similarly,\n\n10101010 ==> {0, 2, 4, 6}\n\n11100000 ==> {0, 1, 2}\n\nYour task is to write a function byte\\_to\\_set which takes a single byte (an integer 0-255), and returns the corresponding set.\n\n```python\n>> byte_to_set(0)\nset()\n\n>> byte_to_set(255)\n{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}\n\n>> byte_to_set(3)\n{6,7}\n\n```",
