  "description": "Your task is to create an array of size `n` with the values of the Fibonnaci sequence, and reverse the order in which the sequence is displayed.\n\nFor example:\n`[1, 1, 2, 3, 5]` would become  `[5, 3, 2, 1, 1]`\n\nYou can assume that `n` will always be a positive integer between and including, 1 and 64.\n\nNote: If you receive a server timeout - Check your code and re-run the tests.\n",
