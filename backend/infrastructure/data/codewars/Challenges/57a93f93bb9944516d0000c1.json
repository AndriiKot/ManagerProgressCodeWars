  "description": "In this kata, your job is to create a class Dictionary which you can add words to and their entries. Example:\n```python\n>>> d = Dictionary()\n\n>>> d.newentry('Apple', 'A fruit that grows on trees')\n\n>>> print(d.look('Apple'))\nA fruit that grows on trees\n\n>>> print(d.look('Banana'))\nCan't find entry for Banana\n```\n```java\n>>> Dictionary d = new Dictionary();\n\n>>> d.newEntry(\"Apple\", \"A fruit that grows on trees\");\n\n>>> System.out.println(d.look(\"Apple\"));\nA fruit that grows on trees\n\n>>> System.out.println(d.look(\"Banana\"));\nCant find entry for Banana\n```\n```javascript\n>>> let d = new Dictionary();\n\n>>> d.newEntry(\"Apple\", \"A fruit that grows on trees\");\n\n>>> console.log(d.look(\"Apple\"));\nA fruit that grows on trees\n\n>>> console.log(d.look(\"Banana\"));\nCan't find entry for Banana\n```\n\nGood luck and happy coding!",
