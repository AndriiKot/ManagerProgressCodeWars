  "description": "A traveling salesman has to visit clients. He got each client's address e.g. `\"432 Main Long Road St. Louisville OH 43071\"` as a list.\n\nThe basic zipcode format usually consists of two capital letters followed by a white space and five digits.\nThe list of clients to visit was given as a string of all addresses, each separated from the others by a comma, e.g. :\n\n`\"123 Main Street St. Louisville OH 43071,432 Main Long Road St. Louisville OH 43071,786 High Street Pollocksville NY 56432\"`.\n\nTo ease his travel he wants to group the list by zipcode.\n#### Task\nThe function `travel` will take two parameters `r` (addresses' list of all clients' as a string) and `zipcode` and returns a string in the following format:\n\n`zipcode:street and town,street and town,.../house number,house number,...` \n\nThe street numbers must be in the same order as the streets where they belong.\n\nIf a given zipcode doesn't exist in the list of clients' addresses return `\"zipcode:/\"`\n\n#### Examples\n```\nr = \"123 Main Street St. Louisville OH 43071,432 Main Long Road St. Louisville OH 43071,786 High Street Pollocksville NY 56432\"\n\ntravel(r, \"OH 43071\") --> \"OH 43071:Main Street St. Louisville,Main Long Road St. Louisville/123,432\"\n\ntravel(r, \"NY 56432\") --> \"NY 56432:High Street Pollocksville/786\"\n\ntravel(r, \"NY 5643\") --> \"NY 5643:/\"\n```\n\n#### Note for Elixir:\nIn Elixir the empty addresses' input is an empty *list*, not an empty string.\n\n#### Note: \nYou can see a few addresses and zipcodes in the test cases.",
