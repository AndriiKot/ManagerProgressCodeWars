  "description": "# Task:\nLeo's girlfriend asked him to buy a gift list during his next trip, now he wants to know how many of them will he be able to buy.\n\nWrite a function to help Leo out. The first parameter of the function is Leo's budget; the second one is an array containing the price of each gift. You should return an integer representing the maximum amount of gifts Leo can buy.\n\n# Example:\nMaximum budget: `20`  \nGift List: `[13, 2, 4, 6, 1]`  \nShould return `4`.\n\n_ NOTE: All numbers will be integers >= 0, and the array will never be empty. _",
