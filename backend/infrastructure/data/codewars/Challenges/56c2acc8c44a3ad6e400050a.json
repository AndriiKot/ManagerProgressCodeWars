  "description": "Gigi is a clever monkey, living in the zoo, his teacher (animal keeper) recently taught him some knowledge of \"0\".\n\nIn Gigi's eyes, \"0\" is a character contains some circle (maybe one, maybe two).\n\nSo, a is a \"0\",b is a \"0\",6 is also a \"0\"，and 8 have two \"0\" ,etc...\n\nNow, write some code to count how many \"0\"s in the text.\n\nLet us see who is smarter? You ? or monkey?\n\nInput always be a string (including words numbers and symbols)，You don't need to verify it, but pay attention to the difference between uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\nHere is a table of characters：\n\n| **Number of zeros**   | **Characters**                                             |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | abdegopq069DOPQR     () <-- A pair of braces as a zero                     |\n| 2 | %&B8                                                                           |\n\nOutput will be a number of \"0\".\n\n",
