  "description": "# Task\nYou have a list of integers. The task is to return the maximum sum of the elements located between two negative elements. No negative element should be present in the sum.\nIf there is no such sum: `-1` for Python, C++, JavaScript, Java, CoffeeScript and COBOL, `Nothing` for Haskell, `None` for Rust.\n\n## Example 1\n```\n[4, -1, 6, -2, 3, 5, -7, 7] -> 8\n     ^      ^         ^\n```\n\nSum between `-1` and `-2` is `6`, between `-2` and `-7` is 3 + 5 = `8`.\nIt's also not `14` (between `-1` and `-7`), because this includes a negative number (`-2`).\n\n## Example 2\n```\n[4, -1, -2] -> 0\n     ^   ^\n```\nThere is nothing between `-1` and `-2`, so return `0`.",
