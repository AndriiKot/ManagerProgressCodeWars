  "description": "You're given a square consisting of random numbers, like so:\n```javascript\nvar square = [\n    [1,2,3],\n    [4,8,2],\n    [1,5,3]];\n```\nYour job is to calculate the minimum total cost when moving from the upper left corner to the coordinate given. You're only allowed to move right or down.\n\nIn the above example the minimum path would be:\n```javascript\nvar square = [\n    [1,2,3],\n    [_,_,2],\n    [_,_,3]];\n```\nGiving a total of 11. Start and end position are included.\n\nNote: Coordinates are marked as x horizontally and y vertically.",
