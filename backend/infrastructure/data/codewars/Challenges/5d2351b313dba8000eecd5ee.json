  "description": "*This is the advanced version of the [Total Primes](https://www.codewars.com/kata/total-primes/) kata.*\n\n\nThe number `23` is the smallest prime that can be \"cut\" into **multiple** primes: `2, 3`. Another such prime is `6173`, which can be cut into `61, 73` or `617, 3` or `61, 7, 3` (all primes). A third one is `557` which can be sliced into `5, 5, 7`. Let's call these numbers **total primes**.\n\nNotes:\n* one-digit primes are excluded by definition;\n* leading zeros are also excluded: e.g. splitting `307` into `3, 07` is **not** valid\n\n\n### Task\n\nComplete the function that takes a range `[a..b]` (both limits included) and returns the total primes within that range (`a ≤ total primes ≤ b`).\n\nThe tests go up to 10<sup>6</sup>.\n~~~if:python\nFor your convenience, a list of primes up to 10<sup>6</sup> is preloaded, called `PRIMES`.\n~~~\n\n\n### Examples\n\n```\n(0, 100)    -->  [23, 37, 53, 73]\n(500, 600)  -->  [523, 541, 547, 557, 571, 577, 593]\n```\n\nHappy coding!\n\n---\n\n### My other katas\n\nIf you enjoyed this kata then please try [my other katas](https://www.codewars.com/users/anter69/authored)! :-)\n\n#### *Translations are welcome!*",
