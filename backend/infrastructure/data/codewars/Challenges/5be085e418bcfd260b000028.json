  "description": "Ever wonder how many keystrokes any given string takes to type? No? Most normal people don't...but we're not normal! :D\n\nProgram a ```num_key_strokes (string)``` function that takes a string and returns a count of the number of keystrokes that it took to type that string.\n\nFor example, ```Hello, world!```  takes 15 key strokes to type. \n\nThis kata is expecting an EN-US keyboard mapping, specifically using the QWERTY layout. \n\n## Rules\n\n* This kata assumes that the string was only typed using the main keyboard and NOT a number-pad.\n* We also assume that the user does not hold down the ```Shift``` key and thus has to press it once every time it's needed. In addition, the ```CAPS LOCK```  key is not used.\n* Every character in the input string requires either ```1``` or ```2``` keystrokes. Your goal is to figure out which ones belong in which group and count the total number of keystrokes.\n\nHere's a picture of the en-US QWERTY layout :\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/KB_United_States-NoAltGr.svg/1920px-KB_United_States-NoAltGr.svg.png\" title=\"the en-US QWERTY layout\" alt=\"the en-US QWERTY layout\" style = \"width:85%\">\n\n\n",
