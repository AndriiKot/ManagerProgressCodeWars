Each week you will learn some more rules.\n\n<div style='font-weight:bold;color:orange'>Und by ze fifz vek yu vil be speakink viz un aksent lik Siegfried viz no trubl at al!</div>\n\n<hr>\n\n# Lessons\n\n## Week 1\n\n* ```ci``` -> ```si```\n* ```ce``` -> ```se```\n* ```c``` -> ```k``` (except ```ch``` leave alone)\n\n## Week 2\n\n* ```ph``` -> ```f```\n\n## Week 3\n\n* remove trailing ```e``` (except for all 2 and 3 letter words)\n* replace double letters with single letters (e.g. ```tt``` -> ```t```)\n\n## Week 4\n\n* ```th``` -> ```z```\n* ```wr``` -> ```r```\n* ```wh``` -> ```v```\n* ```w``` -> ```v```\n\n## Week 5\n\n* ```ou``` -> ```u```\n* ```an``` -> ```un```\n* ```ing``` -> ```ink``` (but only when ending words)\n* ```sm``` -> ```schm``` (but only when beginning words)\n\n<hr>\n\n# Notes\n\n* The transformations described in the \"Lessons\" are case-insensitive\n* The output must retain the case of the original sentence\n* Apply rules strictly in the order given above\n* Rules are cummulative. So for week 3 first apply week 1 rules, then week 2 rules, then week 3 rules",
