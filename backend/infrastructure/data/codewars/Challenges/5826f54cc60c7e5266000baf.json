  "description": "A rectangle is can be defined by two factors: height and width.\n\nIts area is defined as the multiplication of the two: height * width.\n\nIts perimeter is the sum of its four edges: height + height + width + width.\n\nIt is possible to create rectangles of the same area but different perimeters.\nFor example, given an area of 45, the possible heights, widths and resultant perimeters would be:\n\n(1, 45) = 92\n\n(9, 5) = 28\n\n(15, 3) = 36\n\nNote that (6, 7.5) has an area of 45 too, but is discarded in this kata because its width is non integral.\n\nThe task is to write a function that, given an area as a positive integer, returns the smallest perimeter possible of a rectangle with integral side lengths.\n\n### Input range:\n~~~if-not:cpp\n1 <= area <= 5 x 10 ^ 10\n~~~\n~~~if:cpp\n1 <= area <= 982451653\n~~~\n",
