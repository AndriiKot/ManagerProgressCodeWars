  "description": "Julie is x years older than her brother, and she is also y times as old as him.\n\nGiven x and y, create a function calculating Julie's age.\n\nFor example:\n```\nx: 6\ny: 3\noutput: 9\n```\nNote also that x can be negative, and y can be a decimal.\n```\nx: -15, \ny: 0.25\noutput: 5\n```\nThat is, Julie is 15 years younger and 0.25 times the age of her brother.\n\nDo not concern yourself with the imperfections inherent in dividing by floating point numbers,\nas your answer will have a tolerance of 1e-9.  Also, for the sake of simplicity, Julie is never the same age as her brother.\n",
