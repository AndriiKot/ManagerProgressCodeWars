  "description": "Deep within the fair realm of Lothlórien, you have been asked to create a shortlist of candidates for a recently vacated position on the council.\n\nOf so many worthy elves, who to choose for such a lofty position? After much thought you decide to select candidates by name, which are often closely aligned to an elf's skill and temperament.\n\nChoose those with *tegil* appearing anywhere in their **first name**, as they are likely to be good calligraphers, **OR** those with *astar* anywhere in their **last name**, who will be faithful to the role.\n\nElves table:\n* firstname\n* lastname\n\n*all names are in lowercase*\n\nTo aid the scribes, return the *firstname* and *lastname* column concatenated, separated by a space, into a single *shortlist* column, and capitalise the first letter of each name.",
