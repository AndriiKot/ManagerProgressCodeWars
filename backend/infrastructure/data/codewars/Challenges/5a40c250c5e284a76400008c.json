  "description": "You drop a ball from a given height. After each bounce, the ball returns to some fixed proportion of its previous height. If the ball bounces to height 1 or less, we consider it to have stopped bouncing. Return the number of bounces it takes for the ball to stop moving.\n\n```\nbouncingBall(initialHeight, bouncingProportion)\n\nboucingBall(4, 0.5)\nAfter first bounce, ball bounces to height 2\nAfter second bounce, ball bounces to height 1\nTherefore answer is 2 bounces\n\nboucingBall(30, 0.3)\nAfter first bounce, ball bounces to height 9\nAfter second bounce, ball bounces to height 2.7\nAfter third bounce, ball bounces to height 0.81\nTherefore answer is 3 bounces\n\n\n```\n\nInitial height is an integer in range [2,1000]\n\nBouncing Proportion is a decimal in range [0, 1)",
