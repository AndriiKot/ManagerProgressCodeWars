  "description": "In this kata, your task is to identify the <code>pattern</code> underlying a <code>sequence</code> of numbers. For example, if the sequence is <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>, then the pattern is <code>[1]</code>, since each number in the sequence is equal to the number preceding it, plus 1. See the test cases for more examples.\n\n<em>A few more rules :</em>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pattern</code> may contain negative numbers.</li>\n<li><code>sequence</code> will always be made of a whole number of repetitions of the pattern.</li>\n<li>Your answer must correspond to the shortest form of the pattern, e.g. if the pattern is <code>[1]</code>, then <code>[1, 1, 1, 1]</code> will not be considered a correct answer.</li>\n</ul>",
