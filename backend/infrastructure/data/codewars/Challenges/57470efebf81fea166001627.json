  "description": "Write a function that checks if all the letters in the second string are present in the first one at least once, regardless of how many times they appear:\n\n```\n[\"ab\", \"aaa\"]    =>  true\n[\"trances\", \"nectar\"]    =>  true\n[\"compadres\", \"DRAPES\"]  =>  true\n[\"parses\", \"parsecs\"]    =>  false\n```\n\nFunction should not be case sensitive, as indicated in example #2. Note: both strings are presented as a **single argument** in the form of an array. ",
