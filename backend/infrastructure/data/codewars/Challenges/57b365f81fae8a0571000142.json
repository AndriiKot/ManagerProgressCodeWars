  "description": "Speed is a crucial measure of success for any aspiring warrior, so let's write a function to calculate it.\n\nAverage [Speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed) is calculated by dividing distance by time. Given two strings as input the first of which indicates a codewarrior's `distance` travelled (in metres or kilometres) and the second indicating the `time` it takes them to travel (in seconds or minutes), return a string indicating their speed in miles per hour rounded to the nearest integer.\n\nFor the purposes of this kata one metre per second is defined as 2.23694 miles per hour.\n\nSo for example given the input values of distance & time `\"3km\"` and `\"5min\"` we should return a speed value of `\"22mph\"`.",
