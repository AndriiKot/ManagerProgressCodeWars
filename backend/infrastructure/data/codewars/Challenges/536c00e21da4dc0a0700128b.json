  "description": "Create a function that returns a villain name based on the user's birthday. The birthday will be passed to the function as a valid Date object, so for simplicity, there's no need to worry about converting strings to dates.\n\nThe first name will come from the month, and the last name will come from the last digit of the day:\n\nMonth -> first name\n\n* January -> \"The Evil\"\n* February -> \"The Vile\"\n* March -> \"The Cruel\"\n* April -> \"The Trashy\"\n* May -> \"The Despicable\"\n* June -> \"The Embarrassing\"\n* July -> \"The Disreputable\"\n* August -> \"The Atrocious\"\n* September -> \"The Twirling\"\n* October -> \"The Orange\"\n* November -> \"The Terrifying\"\n* December -> \"The Awkward\"\n\nLast digit of day -> last name\n\n* 0 -> \"Mustache\"\n* 1 -> \"Pickle\"\n* 2 -> \"Hood Ornament\"\n* 3 -> \"Raisin\"\n* 4 -> \"Recycling Bin\"\n* 5 -> \"Potato\"\n* 6 -> \"Tomato\"\n* 7 -> \"House Cat\"\n* 8 -> \"Teaspoon\"\n* 9 -> \"Laundry Basket\"\n\n\nThe returned value should be a string in the form of `\"First Name Last Name\"`.\n\nFor example, a birthday of November 18 would return `\"The Terrifying Teaspoon\"`\n",
