  "description": "**An [isogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogram)** (also known as a \"nonpattern word\") is a logological term for a word or phrase without a repeating letter. It is also used by some to mean a word or phrase in which each letter appears the same number of times, not necessarily just once.\n\nYou task is to write a method `isogram?` that takes a string argument and returns true if the string has the properties of being an isogram and false otherwise. Anything that is not a string is not an isogram (ints, nils, etc.)\n\n\n**Properties:**\n \n - must be a string\n - cannot be nil or empty\n - each letter appears the same number of times (not necessarily just once)\n - letter case is not important (= case insensitive)\n - non-letter characters (e.g. hyphens) should be ignored",
