  "description": "There's a waiting room with N chairs set in single row. Chairs are consecutively numbered from 1 to N. First is closest to the entrance (which is exit as well).\n \nFor some reason people choose a chair in the following way\n\n1. Find a place as far from other people as possible\n2. Find a place as close to exit as possible\n\nAll chairs must be occupied before the first person will be served\n\nSo it looks like this for 10 chairs and 10 patients\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n  <th>Chairs</th>\n  <th>1</th>\n  <th>2</th>\n  <th>3</th>\n  <th>4</th>\n  <th>5</th>\n  <th>6</th>\n  <th>7</th>\n  <th>8</th>\n  <th>9</th>\n  <th>10</th>\n<tr>\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n  <td>Patients</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td>7</td>\n  <td>5</td>\n  <td>8</td>\n  <td>3</td>\n  <td>9</td>\n  <td>4</td>\n  <td>6</td>\n  <td>10</td>\n  <td>2</td>\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\nYour task is to find last patient's chair's number. \n\n```\nInput: number of chairs N, an integer greater than 2.\nOutput: a positive integer, the last patient's chair number.\n```\n\nHave fun :)",
