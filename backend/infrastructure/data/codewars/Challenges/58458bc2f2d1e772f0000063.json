  "description": "## Objective \n\nWrite a function named `prettyTimeFormat` that takes a number of seconds and converts it to a colon-separated format with hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* If there are 0 hours, it should be omitted, along with the colon separating hours and minutes.\n* If there are 0 hours and 0 minutes, both should be omitted, along with all colons.\n* Seconds should have a leading 0 if minutes are greater than 0 and seconds are less than 10.\n* Minutes should have a leading 0 if hours are greater than 0 and minutes are less than 10.\n* Hours should never have a leading 0.\n* Minutes and seconds should never exceed 2 digits.\n* Input can be a float, but floats should round down (floor). \n* Output should be a string. \n* Assume that input values will be positive numbers or 0.\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nformatTime(5);    // should return 5\nformatTime(30);    // should return 30\nformatTime(90);    // should return 1:30\nformatTime(14989); // Should return 4:09:49\n```\n",
