  "description": "Do you have in mind the good old TicTacToe?\n\nAssuming that you get all the data in one array, you put a space around each value, `|` as a columns separator and multiple `-` as rows separator, with something like `[\"O\", \"X\", \" \", \" \", \"X\", \" \", \"X\", \"O\", \" \"]` you should be returning this structure (inclusive of new lines):\n\n```\n O | X |   \n-----------\n   | X |   \n-----------\n X | O |   \n```\n\nNow, to spice up things a bit, we are going to expand our board well beyond a trivial `3` x `3` square and we will accept rectangles of big sizes, still all as a long linear array.\n\nFor example, for `\"O\", \"X\", \" \", \" \", \"X\", \" \", \"X\", \"O\", \" \", \"O\"]` (same as above, just one extra `\"O\"`) and knowing that the length of each row is `5`, you will be returning\n\n```\n O | X |   |   | X \n-------------------\n   | X | O |   | O \n```\n\nAnd worry not about missing elements, as the array/list/vector length is always going to be a multiple of the width.",
