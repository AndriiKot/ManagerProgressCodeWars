  "description": "These are intended as quick, digestable learning modules. If you have a strong understanding of prototypes already; skip on down to the \"Objective\" section below. If the Kata turns out to be puzzling, switch back to the lesson to find a clue that may help you solve it. \n\n###What are prototypes?\n\nIn JavaScript, all objects have a built-in, internal `prototype` property. This property is essentially a link to another object. You can create a link between objects by calling `Object.create` on the parent object:\n\n```javascript\nvar apple = {\n  delicious: true\n}\n\nvar honeycrisp = Object.create(apple);\n```\n\nNow `honeycrisp` is linked to `apple`, where if you were to call `honeycrisp.delicious`, we would get `true`. Additionally, any properties added to `apple` will be available on `honeycrisp` automatically via ths link. This lookup on `apple` occurs because of JavaScript's internal mechanism of a \"Prototype Chain\". If the property isn't available on the current object, it will continue up the Prototype Chain until the property is found, or until we reach the top of the chain (where it will return `undefined`). For objects, the very top of the chain is the built-in `Object.prototype`; all objects will inhherit from this.\n\nNow you should have enough information to try the Kata. Good luck!\n \n##Objective\n\nYour friend is terrible at naming objects. We can see that from looking at the three she's created here:\n\n```javascript\nvar widget = {\n  foo: \"bar\"\n}\n\nvar gadget = {\n  bar: \"foo\"\n}\n\nvar thingamabob = { \n  bar: \"food\"\n}\n```\n\nWithout changing the objects you want to add a `description` property to each object with a default value of \"TODO: GIVE ME A DESCRIPTION\" (the entire string), to eventually attach some explanation to these objects. The three objects have already been pre-loaded for you, so they will be available in your main code editor.\n\n**Note: This is a contrived example for learning purposes. This actual example is not encouraged in practice, while the concept is worthwhile to understand.**\n\nGood luck! =)",
