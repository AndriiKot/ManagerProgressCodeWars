  "description": "## Task\n\nRam lives in a house which is round in shape. The house has `n` entrances numbered from `1` to `n`. For each `i` in range `1..n-1` entrances `i` and `i + 1` are adjacent; entrances `1` and `n` are also adjacent.\n\nRam's flat is located at entrance `a`. Each evening he goes for a walk around the house, counting the entrances he walks by. Today Ram decided to walk until he counts `b` entrances.\n\nHelp Ram to determine the number of the entrance near which he will be at the end of his walk.\n\n\n## Input/Output\n\n\n**Input:**\n* integer `n` - The number of entrances, `1 ≤ n ≤ 200`\n* integer `a` - The number of the entrance where Ram starts his walk, `1 ≤ a ≤ n`\n* integer `b` - The number of entrances Ram wants to count, `-100 000 ≤ b ≤ 100 000`\n\n##### *Note:*\n\n* if `b > 0`, Ram walks clockwise until he counts `b` entrances\n* if `b < 0`, Ram walks counterclockwise until he counts `b` entrances\n* if `b = 0`, Ram stays at his entrance and doesn't go anywhere\n\n\n\n**Output:**\n* an integer - The number of the house at the end of his walk.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nFor `n = 5, a = 1 and b = 3`, the output should be `4`: Ram will walk clockwise around the house, counting the entrances as follows: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`\n\nFor `n = 6, a = 2 and b = -5`, the output should be `3`: \nRam will walk counterclockwise around the house, so he will count the entrances as follows: `2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3`\n",
