  "description": "The Catalan Numbers are defined by the formula:\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/dpDsgz2\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/dpDsgz2.png?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nThe first nine Catalan Numbers are: \n```\nCatalan Number    Ordinal Term\n1                      0\n1                      1\n2                      2\n5                      3\n14                     4\n42                     5\n132                    6\n429                    7\n1430                   8\n```\nThe Hankel Matrix is filled with the Catalan Numbers repeating the same term along the diagonals that have the direction UP-RIGHT to DOWN-LEFT, and have a courious property, its determinant is equal to 1.\nThe following is a 4 x 4 Hankel matrix, and as we said before, its determinant value equals to 1.\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/8fiCuvt\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8fiCuvt.png?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nThe task for this kata is to create a code that may build a Hankel Matrix with the distribution of terms given above.\nFor more information about Catalan Numbers and the Hankel Matrix you may check at Wikipedia, <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_numberhere\"> Here</a>.\n\nFeatures of the random Tests:\n```\nnumber of tests = 80\n2 <= n <= 100  // n, dimension of the matrix\n```",
