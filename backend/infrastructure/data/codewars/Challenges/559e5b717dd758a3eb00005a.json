  "description": "DropCaps means that the first letter of the starting word of the paragraph should be in caps and the remaining lowercase, just like you see in the newspaper. \n\nBut for a change, let\"s do that for each and every word of the given String. Your task is to capitalize every word that has length greater than 2, leaving smaller words as they are.\n\n*should work also on Leading and Trailing Spaces and caps.\n\n```\n\"apple\"            => \"Apple\"\n\"apple of banana\"  => \"Apple of Banana\"\n\"one   space\"      => \"One   Space\"\n\"   space WALK   \" => \"   Space Walk   \" \n```\n\n**Note:** you will be provided atleast one word and should take string as input and return string as output.",
