  "description": "Write a method that, given two arguments, ```width``` and ```height```, returns a string representing a rectangle with those dimensions.\n\nThe rectangle should be filled with spaces, and its borders should be composed of asterisks (```*```).\n\nFor example, given `width = 3` and `height = 3`:\n\n```\n***\n* *\n***\n```\n\nEnd each line of the string (including the last one) with a carriage return-line feed combination.\n\nNote: You may assume that width and height will always be greater than zero.",
