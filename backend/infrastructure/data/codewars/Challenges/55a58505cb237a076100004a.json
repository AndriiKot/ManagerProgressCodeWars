  "description": "Find the 2nd largest integer in array\nIf the array has no 2nd largest integer then return nil.\nReject all non integers elements and then find the 2nd largest integer in array\n\nfind_2nd_largest([1,2,3]) => 2\n\nfind_2nd_largest([1,1,1,1,1]) => nil\nbecause all elements are same. Largest no. is 1. and there is no 2nd largest no.\n\nfind_2nd_largest([1,'a','2',3,3,4,5,'b']) => 4\nas after rejecting non integers array will be [1,3,3,4,5]\nLargest no. is 5. and 2nd largest is 4.\n\nReturn nil if there is no 2nd largest integer.\nTake care of big numbers as well",
