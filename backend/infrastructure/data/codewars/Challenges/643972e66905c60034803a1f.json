  "description": "The owner of a DVD rental store is curious to know which dates in May and June 2005 had the most rentals. Write a query to generate a list of dates between May 24th and June 2nd (inclusive), 2005 and counts the number of rentals on each date.\nThe query should return a result set with two columns: `date` and `rentals`. The `date` column should be formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The `rentals` column should contain the number of rentals that occurred on that date.\n\n\n##### Notes:\n\n*  If there are no rentals, you need to display `0` for that day, not to avoid that day \n*  The result set should be sorted by date in ascending order\n*  for the sample tests, static dump of [DVD Rental Sample Database](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/) is used, for the final solution - random tests. \n\n### Schema\n\n#### `rental` table:\n```\nColumn       | Type      | Modifiers\n-------------+-----------+----------\nrental_id    | integer   | not null\ncustomer_id  | integer   | not null\ninventory_id | integer   | not null\nrental_date  | timestamp | not null\nreturn_date  | timestamp | \n```\n### Desired Output\n\nThe desired output should look like this:\n\n```\ndate         |  rentals\n-------------+---------------+\n2005-05-24   | 38            |\n2005-05-25   | 29            | \n...\n```\n",
