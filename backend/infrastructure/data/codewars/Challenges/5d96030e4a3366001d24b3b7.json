  "description": "### Story\n\nYou just returned from a car trip, and you are curious about your fuel consumption during the trip. Unfortunately, you didn't reset the counter before you started, but you have written down the average consumption of the car and the previous distance travelled at that time. Looking at the dashboard, you note the current data...\n\n\n### Task\n\nComplete the function that receives two pairs of input (`before, after`), and return the *calculated* average fuel consumption of your car during your trip, rounded to 1 decimal.\n\nBoth pairs consist of 2 valid numbers:\n* the average consumption of the car (`l/100km`, float)\n* the previous distance travelled (`km`, integer)\n\n<!--\n**NOTE:** To avoid floating point issues, **use rounding only in the very last step!**\n-->\n\n### Examples\n\n```c\n     BEFORE               AFTER               DURING\navg. cons,  dist     avg. cons,  dist        avg. cons\n[l/100km]   [km]     [l/100km]   [km]        [l/100km]\n\n[  7.9  ,  100  ] ,  [  7.0  ,  200  ]   -->    6.1\n[  7.9  ,  500  ] ,  [  7.0  ,  600  ]   -->    2.5\n[  7.9  ,  100  ] ,  [  7.0  ,  600  ]   -->    6.8\n```\n\n---\n\n### My other katas\n\nIf you enjoyed this kata then please try [my other katas](https://www.codewars.com/users/anter69/authored)! :-)\n\n\n#### *Translations are welcome!*",
