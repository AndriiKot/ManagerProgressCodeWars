  "description": "Write a function that will solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. The function will take one argument consisting of the 2D puzzle array, with the value ```0``` representing an unknown square. \n\nThe Sudokus tested against your function will be \"easy\" (i.e. determinable; there will be no need to assume and test possibilities on unknowns) and can be solved with a brute-force approach.\n\nFor Sudoku rules, see [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku).\n\n```python\npuzzle = [[5,3,0,0,7,0,0,0,0],\n          [6,0,0,1,9,5,0,0,0],\n          [0,9,8,0,0,0,0,6,0],\n          [8,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,3],\n          [4,0,0,8,0,3,0,0,1],\n          [7,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6],\n          [0,6,0,0,0,0,2,8,0],\n          [0,0,0,4,1,9,0,0,5],\n          [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,7,9]]\n\nsudoku(puzzle)\n# Should return\n [[5,3,4,6,7,8,9,1,2],\n  [6,7,2,1,9,5,3,4,8],\n  [1,9,8,3,4,2,5,6,7],\n  [8,5,9,7,6,1,4,2,3],\n  [4,2,6,8,5,3,7,9,1],\n  [7,1,3,9,2,4,8,5,6],\n  [9,6,1,5,3,7,2,8,4],\n  [2,8,7,4,1,9,6,3,5],\n  [3,4,5,2,8,6,1,7,9]]\n```\n```javascript\nvar puzzle = [\n            [5,3,0,0,7,0,0,0,0],\n            [6,0,0,1,9,5,0,0,0],\n            [0,9,8,0,0,0,0,6,0],\n            [8,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,3],\n            [4,0,0,8,0,3,0,0,1],\n            [7,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6],\n            [0,6,0,0,0,0,2,8,0],\n            [0,0,0,4,1,9,0,0,5],\n            [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,7,9]];\n\nsudoku(puzzle);\n/* Should return\n[[5,3,4,6,7,8,9,1,2],\n[6,7,2,1,9,5,3,4,8],\n[1,9,8,3,4,2,5,6,7],\n[8,5,9,7,6,1,4,2,3],\n[4,2,6,8,5,3,7,9,1],\n[7,1,3,9,2,4,8,5,6],\n[9,6,1,5,3,7,2,8,4],\n[2,8,7,4,1,9,6,3,5],\n[3,4,5,2,8,6,1,7,9]] \n```\n```php\nsudoku([\n  [5,3,0,0,7,0,0,0,0],\n  [6,0,0,1,9,5,0,0,0],\n  [0,9,8,0,0,0,0,6,0],\n  [8,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,3],\n  [4,0,0,8,0,3,0,0,1],\n  [7,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6],\n  [0,6,0,0,0,0,2,8,0],\n  [0,0,0,4,1,9,0,0,5],\n  [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,7,9]\n]); /* => [\n  [5,3,4,6,7,8,9,1,2],\n  [6,7,2,1,9,5,3,4,8],\n  [1,9,8,3,4,2,5,6,7],\n  [8,5,9,7,6,1,4,2,3],\n  [4,2,6,8,5,3,7,9,1],\n  [7,1,3,9,2,4,8,5,6],\n  [9,6,1,5,3,7,2,8,4],\n  [2,8,7,4,1,9,6,3,5],\n  [3,4,5,2,8,6,1,7,9]\n] */\n```\n```haskell\npuzzle = [[5,3,0,0,7,0,0,0,0],\n          [6,0,0,1,9,5,0,0,0],\n          [0,9,8,0,0,0,0,6,0],\n          [8,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,3],\n          [4,0,0,8,0,3,0,0,1],\n          [7,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6],\n          [0,6,0,0,0,0,2,8,0],\n          [0,0,0,4,1,9,0,0,5],\n          [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,7,9]]\n\nsudoku puzzle\n{- Should return\n[[5,3,4,6,7,8,9,1,2],\n [6,7,2,1,9,5,3,4,8],\n [1,9,8,3,4,2,5,6,7],\n [8,5,9,7,6,1,4,2,3],\n [4,2,6,8,5,3,7,9,1],\n [7,1,3,9,2,4,8,5,6],\n [9,6,1,5,3,7,2,8,4],\n [2,8,7,4,1,9,6,3,5],\n [3,4,5,2,8,6,1,7,9]]\n-}\n```\n```rust\n// puzzle before\npuzzle = [\n    [5,3,0,0,7,0,0,0,0],\n    [6,0,0,1,9,5,0,0,0],\n    [0,9,8,0,0,0,0,6,0],\n    [8,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,3],\n    [4,0,0,8,0,3,0,0,1],\n    [7,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6],\n    [0,6,0,0,0,0,2,8,0],\n    [0,0,0,4,1,9,0,0,5],\n    [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,7,9]\n  ]\n\nsudoku(&mut puzzle);\n// puzzle after\n puzzle == [\n    [5,3,4,6,7,8,9,1,2],\n    [6,7,2,1,9,5,3,4,8],\n    [1,9,8,3,4,2,5,6,7],\n    [8,5,9,7,6,1,4,2,3],\n    [4,2,6,8,5,3,7,9,1],\n    [7,1,3,9,2,4,8,5,6],\n    [9,6,1,5,3,7,2,8,4],\n    [2,8,7,4,1,9,6,3,5],\n    [3,4,5,2,8,6,1,7,9]\n  ]\n```\n```prolog\nPuzzle = [\n    [5,3,0,0,7,0,0,0,0],\n    [6,0,0,1,9,5,0,0,0],\n    [0,9,8,0,0,0,0,6,0],\n    [8,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,3],\n    [4,0,0,8,0,3,0,0,1],\n    [7,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6],\n    [0,6,0,0,0,0,2,8,0],\n    [0,0,0,4,1,9,0,0,5],\n    [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,7,9]\n],\nsudoku(Puzzle, Solution). \n% Should return:\nSolution = [\n    [5,3,4,6,7,8,9,1,2],\n    [6,7,2,1,9,5,3,4,8],\n    [1,9,8,3,4,2,5,6,7],\n    [8,5,9,7,6,1,4,2,3],\n    [4,2,6,8,5,3,7,9,1],\n    [7,1,3,9,2,4,8,5,6],\n    [9,6,1,5,3,7,2,8,4],\n    [2,8,7,4,1,9,6,3,5],\n    [3,4,5,2,8,6,1,7,9]\n].\n```",
