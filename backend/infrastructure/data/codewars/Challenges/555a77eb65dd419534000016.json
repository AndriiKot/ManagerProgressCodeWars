  "description": "## A function that works sometimes\n\nThis kata is heavily influenced by the [Once](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5307ff5b588fe6d7000000a5/ \"Once\") kata. It just adds a few extra steps to test fundamentals.\n\nImplement a function `sometimes` that takes another funciton as an argument and returns a new version of that function that will behave as the following:\n\n```javascript\n// Example function that will be passed as an argument to sometimes\nfunction add (a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nvar s = sometimes(add);\n\n// The first 3 tmes we call s it returns add's expected output\ns(4, 6) // returns 10\ns(3, 6) // returns 9\ns(2, 6) // returns 8\n\n// But the 4th time it returns a default message 'hmm, I don't know!'\ns(1, 6) // returns 'hmm, I don't know!'\n\n// Each consecutive odd call returns add's expected output\ns(1, 5) // returns 6\n\n// Each consecutive even call doesn't work and returns 'hmm, I don't know!'\ns(1, 4) // returns 'hmm, I don't know!'\n```\n\n```coffeescript\n# Example function that will be passed as an argument to sometimes\nadd = (a, b) -> a + b\n\ns = sometimes add\n\n# The first 3 tmes we call s it returns add's expected output\ns 4, 6 # returns 10\ns 3, 6 # returns 9\ns 2, 6 # returns 8\n\n# But the 4th time it returns a default message \"hmm, I don't know!\"\ns 1, 6 # returns \"hmm, I don't know!\"\n\n# Each consecutive odd call returns add's expected output\ns 1, 5 # returns 6\n\n# Each consecutive even call doesn't work and returns \"hmm, I don't know!\"\ns 1, 4 # returns \"hmm, I don't know!\"\n```",
