  "description": "# Task\n You are given an array of integers that you want distribute between several groups. The first group should contain numbers from 1 to 10<sup>4</sup>, the second should contain those from 10<sup>4</sup> + 1 to 2 x 10<sup>4</sup>, ..., the 100<sup>th</sup> one should contain numbers from 99 x 10<sup>4</sup> + 1 to 10<sup>6</sup> and so on.\n\n All the numbers will then be written down in groups to the text file in such a way that:\n```\nthe groups go one after another;\neach non-empty group has a header which occupies one line;\neach number in a group occupies one line.\n```\nCalculate how many lines the resulting text file will have.\n\n# Example\n\n For `a = [20000, 239, 10001, 999999, 10000, 20566, 29999]`, \n \n the output should be `11`.\n\n The numbers can be divided into 4 groups:\n\n 239 and 10000 go to the 1st group (1 ... 10<sup>4</sup>);\n\n 10001 and 20000 go to the second 2nd (10<sup>4</sup> + 1 ... 2 x 10<sup>4</sup>);\n\n 20566 and 29999 go to the 3rd group (2 x 10<sup>4</sup> + 1 ... 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>);\n \n groups from 4 to 99 are empty;\n \n 999999 goes to the 100<sup>th</sup> group (99 * 10<sup>4</sup> + 1 ... 10<sup>6</sup>).\n \n Thus, there will be 4 groups (i.e. four headers) and 7 numbers, \n \n so the file will occupy 4 + 7 = 11 lines.\n\n The file like this:\n```\n1-10000:\n239\n10000\n10001-20000:\n10001\n20000\n20001-30000:\n20566\n29999\n990001-1000000:\n999999\n```\n\n# Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` integer array `a`\n\n   Constraints: 1 ≤ a.length ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>.\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\nThe number of lines needed to store the grouped numbers.",
