  "description": "### Task\n\nYesterday you found some shoes in your room. Each shoe is described by two values:\n```\ntype indicates if it's a left or a right shoe;\nsize is the size of the shoe.\n```\n\nYour task is to check whether it is possible to pair the shoes you found in such a way that each pair consists of a right and a left shoe of an equal size.\n\n### Example\n\nFor:\n```\nshoes = [[0, 21], \n         [1, 23], \n         [1, 21], \n         [0, 23]]\n```\n\nthe output should be `true`;\n\nFor:\n```\nshoes = [[0, 21], \n         [1, 23], \n         [1, 21], \n         [1, 23]]\n```\nthe output should be `false`.\n\n### Input/Output\n\n- `[input]` 2D integer array `shoes`  \n  Array of shoes. Each shoe is given in the format [type, size], where type is either 0 or 1 for left and right respectively, and size is a positive integer.\n\n  Constraints: `2 ≤ shoes.length ≤ 50,  1 ≤ shoes[i][1] ≤ 100.`\n\n- `[output]` a boolean value\n\n  `true` if it is possible to pair the shoes, `false` otherwise.",
