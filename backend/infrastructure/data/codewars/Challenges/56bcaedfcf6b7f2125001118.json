  "description": "# Safen User Input Part I - htmlspecialchars\n\nYou are a(n) novice/average/experienced/professional/world-famous Web Developer (choose one) who owns a(n) simple/clean/slick/beautiful/complicated/professional/business website (choose one or more) which contains form fields so visitors can send emails or leave a comment on your website with ease.  However, **with ease comes danger**.  Every now and then, a hacker visits your website and attempts to compromise it through the use of **XSS (Cross Site Scripting)**.  This is done by injecting `script` tags into the website through form fields which may contain malicious code (e.g. a redirection to a malicious website that steals personal information).\n\n## Mission\n\nYour mission is to implement a function that converts the following potentially harmful characters:\n\n1. `<` --> `&lt;`\n2. `>` --> `&gt;`\n3. `\"` --> `&quot;`\n4. `&` --> `&amp;`\n\nGood luck :D\n\n\n~~~if:riscv\nRISC-V: the function signature is\n\n```c\nvoid htmlspecialchars(const char *str, char *out);\n```\n\n`str` is the input string. Write your result to `out`. You may assume `out` is large enough to hold the result. You do not need to return anything.\n~~~",
