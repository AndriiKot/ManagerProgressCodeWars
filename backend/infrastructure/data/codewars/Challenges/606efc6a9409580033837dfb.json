  "description": "You have cultivated a plant, and after months of hard work, the time has come to reap the flowers of your hard work. When it was growing, you added water and fertilizer, and kept a constant temperature. It's time check how much your plant has grown.\n\nA plant is represented horizontally, from the base to the left, to the end to the right:\n\n```\n---@---@---@\n```\n\nThe stem is represented by hyphens `-`, and the flowers are represented by symbols. A plant always starts with the stem, and always ends with flowers.\n\nFour parameters will be given. The four parameters are:\n\n+ `seed` (string) - _determines the type of flowers generated by the plant._\n+ `water` (integer) - _each unit of water extends the portion of stem between the flowers. It also gives how many times the stems + flower clusters should be repeated_\n+ `fert` (integer) - _each unit of fertilizer increases the amount of flowers, grouped in clusters_\n+ `temp` (integer) - _if the temperature given is in the range of 20°C and 30°C, the plant grows normally, otherwise, all the flowers die except for one flower at the end of the stem._\n\nGiven the above parameters, your task is to return a string representing the plant.\n\n### Examples\n\n```python\nplant(\"@\", 3, 3, 25) => \"---@@@---@@@---@@@\"\n# Water gives the length of the stem portions between flowers\n# Water also gives the total number of segments(number of times flowers + stems should be repeated)\n# Fertilizer gives the length of the flower clusters.\n# Temperature is in the range of 20°C and 30°C\n\nplant(\"$\", 4, 2, 30) => \"----$$----$$----$$----$$\"\n\nplant(\"&\", 1, 5, 20) => \"-&&&&&\"\n\nplant(\"^\", 3, 3, 35) => \"---------^\"\n# The temperature is not in the correct range, so all flowers die, except the last one at the end.\n# The stem is not affected by the temperature\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n+ Edge conditions will not be tested, meaning parameters of water or fertilizer or temperature being zero. This will not be tested. The parameters will always be valid (no zero).\n+ The temperature bounds are inclusive (20 and 30 will be included as 21, 22, 23, 24...)\n\nHappy Coding!\n",
