  "description": "You are given three integer inputs: length, minimum, and maximum.\n\nReturn a string that:\n1. Starts at minimum\n2. Ascends one at a time until reaching the maximum, then\n3. Descends one at a time until reaching the minimum\n4. repeat until the string is the appropriate length\n\nExamples:\n\n```\n length: 5, minimum: 1, maximum: 3   ==>  \"12321\"\n length: 14, minimum: 0, maximum: 2  ==>  \"01210121012101\"\n length: 11, minimum: 5, maximum: 9  ==>  \"56789876567\"\n```\nNotes:\n- length will always be non-negative\n- negative numbers can appear for minimum and maximum values\n- hyphens/dashes (\"-\") for negative numbers do count towards the length\n- the resulting string must be truncated to the exact length provided\n- return an empty string if maximum < minimum or length == 0\n- minimum and maximum can equal one another and result in a single number repeated for the length of the string\n",
