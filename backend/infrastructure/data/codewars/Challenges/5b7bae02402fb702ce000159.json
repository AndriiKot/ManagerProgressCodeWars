  "description": "Assume we take a number `x` and perform any one of the following operations:\n```Pearl\na) Divide x by 3 (if it is divisible by 3), or\nb) Multiply x by 2\n```\nAfter each operation, we write down the result. If we start with `9`, we can get a sequence such as:\n```\n[9,3,6,12,4,8] -- 9/3=3 -> 3*2=6 -> 6*2=12 -> 12/3=4 -> 4*2=8\n```\nYou will be given a shuffled sequence of integers and your task is to reorder them so that they conform to the above sequence. There will always be an answer. \n```\nFor the above example:\nsolve([12,3,9,4,6,8]) = [9,3,6,12,4,8].\n```\n\nMore examples in the test cases. Good luck!\n",
