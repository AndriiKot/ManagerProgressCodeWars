  "description": "Remember all those quadratic equations you had to solve by hand in highschool? Well, no more! You're going to solve all the quadratic equations you might ever[1] have to wrangle with in the future once and for all by coding up the [quadratic formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula) to handle them automatically.\n\nWrite a function `quadratic_formula()` that takes three arguments, `a`, `b`, and `c` that represent the coefficients in a formula of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. Your function shoud return a list with two elements where each element is one of the two roots. If the formula produces a double root the result should be a list where both elements are that value.\n\n~~~if:python\nFor example, `quadratic_formula(2, 16, 1)` should return the list `[-0.06299606299409444, -7.937003937005906]`.\n~~~\n~~~if:javascript\nFor example, `quadraticFormula(2, 16, 1)` should return the list `[-0.06299606299409444, -7.937003937005906]`.\n~~~\nThe order of the roots is not important.\n\n[1] Well, not _ever_ ever. You don't need to worry about getting quadratic equations with complex roots where you need the square root of a negative number. All the test cases will be for equations with real roots.",
