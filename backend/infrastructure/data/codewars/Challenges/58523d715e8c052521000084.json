As a programmer, you need to complete a series of tasks to welcome the arrival of Christmas. This time your task is:\n \n Given two string `s1` and `s2`. You need to perform the following operations: Compare each character of `s2` with `s1`. If s1 contains the character, remove it; If not, append it to `s1`. After these remove or append operations, if the characters of `s1` are same as \"Merry Christmas!\"(order can be different), return `true`; Otherwise, return `false`. For example:\n ```\n var s1=\"abcMerry Christmas!\",s2=\"abc\"\n merryChristmas(s1,s2) === true\n \n var s1=\"abcerry hristmas!\",s2=\"abcMC\"\n merryChristmas(s1,s2) === true\n \n var s1=\"abcMerry Christmas!\",s2=\"bad\"\n merryChristmas(s1,s2) === false\n ```\n ",
