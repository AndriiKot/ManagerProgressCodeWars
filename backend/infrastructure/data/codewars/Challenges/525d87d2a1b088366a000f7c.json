  "description": "> \"I remember once going to see him when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. 'No,' he replied. 'It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.'\" - British mathematician GH Hardy on his visit to Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan in 1918.\n\n## Task\n\nComplete the function cab so that it returns all numbers `< a` that can be expressed as a sum of two positive cubes in `n` different ways (where `1 <= n <= 3`) in increasing order.",
