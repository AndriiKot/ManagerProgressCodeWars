  "description": "**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students**\n\nAll Star Code Challenge #24\n\nYour friend David is an architect who is working on a triangle-focused design. He needs a quick way for knowing the measurement of a right triangle's side, only knowing two of the sides.\n\nHe knows about the Pythagorean Theorem, but is too lazy to do the math. Help him by making 2 functions to ease his troubles.\n\nCreate 2 functions:\n\n1) hypotenuse(), which takes 2 integer arguments, the length of two regular sides of a right triangle, and returns the length of the missing side, the hypotenuse, as a number.\n\n2) leg(), which takes 2 integer arguments, the first being the length of the hypotenuse, and the second being the length of a regular side of a right triangle. This function should return the length of the missing regular side, as a number.\n\n```javascript\nhypotenuse(3,4) // => 5\nleg(5,3) // => 4\n```\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem\n\nNote:\nDo NOT round the ouput number  \nYou do not have to verify if the input values are \"proper\", assume them to be non-zero integers",
