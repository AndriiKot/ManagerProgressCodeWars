  "description": "## A Discovery\n\nOne fine day while Farmer Arepo Tenaciously Labored at Turning the soil, he discovered a field that was scattered with strange stone tablets. Noticing they were carved with letters in a square pattern, he wisely kept them in case some might be special.\n\n## Your Task\n\nPlease help Farmer Arepo by inspecting each tablet to see if it forms a valid <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sator_Square\">Sator Square</a>!\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DjVOjV4.jpeg\" title=\"sator square\" width=\"300\"/>\n\n## The Square\n\nis a two-dimentional palindrome, made from words of equal length that can be read in these four ways:\n```\n    1)    left-to-right    (across)\n    2)    top-to-bottom    (down)\n    3)    bottom-to-top    (up)\n    4)    right-to-left    (reverse)\n```\n\n## An Example\nConsidering this square:\n```\n    B A T S\n    A B U T\n    T U B A\n    S T A B\n```\nHere are the four ways a word (in this case `\"TUBA\"`) can be read:\n\n<pre style='background:black'>\n                         down\n                          ↓\n           B A T S    B A <span style='color:green'>T</span> S    B <span style='color:green'>A</span> T S    B A T S\n           A B U T    A B <span style='color:green'>U</span> T    A <span style='color:green'>B</span> U T    <span style='color:green'>A B U T</span> ← reverse\n  across → <span style='color:green'>T U B A</span>    T U <span style='color:green'>B</span> A    T <span style='color:green'>U</span> B A    T U B A\n           S T A B    S T <span style='color:green'>A</span> B    S <span style='color:green'>T</span> A B    S T A B\n                                   ↑\n                                   up\n</pre>\nIMPORTANT:\n  * In a `true` Sator Square, ALL of its words can be read in ALL four of these ways.\n  * If there is any deviation, it would be `false` to consider it a Sator Square.\n\n## Some Details\n\n* tablet (square) dimensions range from `2x2` to `33x33` inclusive\n* all characters used will be upper-case alphabet letters\n* there is no need to validate any input\n\n## Input\n\n* an N x N (square) two-dimentional matrix of uppercase letters\n\n## Output\n\n* boolean `true` or `false` whether or not the tablet is a Sator Square\n\n## Enjoy!\n\n...and please consider one of the following kata to solve next:\n* [Playing With Toy Blocks ~ Can you build a 4x4 square?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5cab471da732b30018968071)\n* [Four Letter Words ~ Mutations](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5cb5eb1f03c3ff4778402099)\n* [Crossword Puzzle!
