  "description": "You've just finished writing the last chapter for your novel when a virus suddenly infects your document. It has swapped the `'i'`s and `'e'`s in `'ei'` words and capitalised random letters. \n\nWrite a function which will:\n\n1) Remove the spelling errors in 'ei' words. (Examples of 'ei' words: their, caffeine, deceive, weight)\n\n2) Only capitalise the first letter of each sentence. Make sure the rest of the sentence is in lower case. Each sentence is separated by a full stop.\n\nExample: \n\n`He haD iEght ShOTs of CAffIEne.` --> `He had eight shots of caffeine.`",
