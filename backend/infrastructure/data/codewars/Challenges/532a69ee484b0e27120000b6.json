  "description": "Create a class Vector that has simple (3D) vector operators.\n\nIn your class, you should support the following operations, given Vector ```a``` and Vector ```b```:\n\n```ruby\na + b # returns a new Vector that is the resultant of adding them\na - b # same, but with subtraction\na == b # returns true if they have the same magnitude and direction\na.cross(b) # returns a new Vector that is the cross product of a and b\na.dot(b) # returns a number that is the dot product of a and b\na.to_a # returns an array representation of the vector.\na.to_s # returns a string representation of the vector in the form \"<a, b, c>\"\na.magnitude # returns a number that is the magnitude (geometric length) of vector a.\na.x # gets x component\na.y # gets y component\na.z # gets z component\nVector.new([a,b,c]) # creates a new Vector from the supplied 3D array.\nVector.new(a,b,c) # same as above\n```\n```python\na + b # returns a new Vector that is the resultant of adding them\na - b # same, but with subtraction\na == b # returns true if they have the same magnitude and direction\na.cross(b) # returns a new Vector that is the cross product of a and b\na.dot(b) # returns a number that is the dot product of a and b\na.to_tuple() # returns a tuple representation of the vector.\nstr(a) # returns a string representation of the vector in the form \"<a, b, c>\"\na.magnitude # returns a number that is the magnitude (geometric length) of vector a.\na.x # gets x component\na.y # gets y component\na.z # gets z component\nVector([a,b,c]) # creates a new Vector from the supplied 3D array.\nVector(a,b,c) # same as above\n```\nThe test cases will not mutate the produced Vector objects, so don't worry about that.\n",
