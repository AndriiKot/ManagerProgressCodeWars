  "description": "# Task\nThe function is given a string consisting of a collection of three characters:\n\n- \"(\" open bracket\n- \")\" closed bracket\n- \"J\" Joker, which can be replaced by \"(\", \")\" or \"\"\n\nDevelop a solution to determine if the given string represents a proper sequence of parenthesis; return `True / False`. Each open bracket on the left should have a corresponding closed bracket on the right. For example \"(()())\" is a proper sequence, \"()(()\" is not a proper sequence. The presence of Jokers adds an extra level of difficulty to the analysis because each \"J\" makes three possibilities to consider. An empty string is considered a valid string because it does not contain unbalanced brackets.\n\n# Examples\n```\nclosed_brackets(\"(J))\") ➞ True\n# J can be replaced with (\n\nclosed_brackets(\"(\") ➞ False\n# Unbalanced open bracket.\n\nclosed_brackets(\"\") ➞ True\n# Empty string is a valid sequence.\n\nclosed_brackets(\"()J(\") ➞ False\n# Not possible to balance the brackets.\n\nclosed_brackets(\"J\") ➞ True\n# J can be replaced with an empty string.\n\nclosed_brackets(\")(\") ➞ False\n# Numbers of ( and ) are the same but they are in the wrong places.\n\nclosed_brackets(\"J)(J\") ➞ True\n# First 'J' can be replaced with '(' and second with ')'\n\nclosed_brackets(\"()\") ➞ True\n# A proper sequence of balanced brackets.\n```\n\n# Input Constraints\n- 0 <= len(s) <= 100",
