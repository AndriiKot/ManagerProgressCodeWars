  "description": "Quipu Calculator\n\nThe Quipu is the numbering system of the ancient Incas. A number is represented by knots in a string, using a positional representation (in base-10).\n\nThe representation of 123: one knot + space + two knots + space + three knots\n\nZeros are represented using a blank space. (leading zeros are not allowed)\n\n@ is a knot and ~ is a space.\n\n```ruby\n123 => @~@@~@@@\n20 => @@~~\n```\n\n\nCreate a method that calculates mathematical expressions in quipu format.\n\nInput\n\nA string representing a mathematical expression with operands in the quipu format above, separated by the plus [+] or minus [-] or division [/] or multiplication [*] sign.\n\n*Hint1: The expression can also include parenthesis to change order of operation.\n\n*Hint2: Between two 0-s you have to put a space, but between a 0 and 1 for example you haven't.\n\n```ruby \n@~@ => 11\n@~~@ => 101\n@~~~@ => 1001\n@ ~     ~ ~     ~ @ => 1001 (!!)\n1 space 0 space 0 1\n```\n\nOutput\n\nA string representing the result of the mathematical expression in quipu format.\n\nExample:\n```ruby\ncalculate(\"@~@@*@@\")\n=> \"@@~@@@@\"\ncalculate(\"@~@@+@@~~\")\n=> \"@@@~@@\"\n```",
