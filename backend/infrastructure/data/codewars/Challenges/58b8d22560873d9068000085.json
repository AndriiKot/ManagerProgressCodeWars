  "description": "## Task\n You are given a car odometer which displays the miles traveled as an integer. \n \n The odometer has a defect, however: it proceeds from digit `3` to digit `5` always skipping the digit `4`. This defect shows up in all positions (ones, tens, hundreds, etc). \n \n For example, if the odometer displays `15339` and the car travels another mile, the odometer changes to `15350` (instead of `15340`).\n\n Your task is to calculate the real distance, according The number the odometer shows.\n\n## Example\n\n For `n = 13` the output should be `12`(4 skipped).\n \n For `n = 15` the output should be `13`(4 and 14 skipped).\n \n For `n = 2003` the output should be `1461`.\n\n## Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `n`\n\n  The number the odometer shows.\n  \n  `1 <= n <= 999999999`\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\n  The real distance.",
