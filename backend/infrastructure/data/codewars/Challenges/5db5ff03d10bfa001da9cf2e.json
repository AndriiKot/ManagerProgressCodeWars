  "description": "## Task\n\nGiven a table where users' connections are logged, find the first and the last address of the networks they connected from.\n\n## Notes\n* Order the result by the `id` column\n* There's no need to validate anything - it's okay if the user connects from a private network\n* (You don't need the `connection_time` field for this task but without it the input data looks too dull)\n* You can read more about IPv4 [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) (check the [First and last subnet addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#First_and_last_subnet_addresses) section if you need an example/explanation related to this task only)\n\n___\n\n## Input table\n\n```\n---------------------------------------------\n|    Table    |     Column      |   Type    |\n|-------------+-----------------+-----------|\n| connections | id              | int       |\n|             | connection_time | timestamp |\n|             | ip_address      | inet      |\n---------------------------------------------\n```\n\n## Output table\n\n```\n------------------------\n|    Column     | Type |\n|---------------+------|\n| id            | int  |\n| first_address | text |\n| last_address  | text |\n------------------------\n```\n\n___\n\n### Example\n\nFor the IP address `182.240.42.115/24` the first address in the network is `182.240.42.0/24`, and the last one is `182.240.42.255/24`.",
