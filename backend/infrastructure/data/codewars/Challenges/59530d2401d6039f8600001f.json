The odd one weights less than the others, not being of pure gold. In the worst case, how many iterations are actually needed to find the odd one out on a two plates scale*.\n\nI am asking you then to tell me what is the *minimum* amount of weighings it will take to measure `n` coins in every possible occurrence (including worst case scenario, ie: without relying on luck at all).\n\n`n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.\n\n***Tip:*** being able to think *recursively* might help here :p\n\n***Note:*** albeit this is more clearly a logical than a coding problem, do not underestimate (or under-rank) the kata for requiring not necessarily wizard-class coding skills: a good coder is a master of pattern recognition and subsequent optimization ;)",
