  "description": "### Classify a Texas hold'em hand\nYour task is to inspect a hand in Texas hold'em poker after the first stage of dealing and decide whether it contains various valuable card combos. A hand at this stage of the game consists of five cards; two \"hole cards\" dealt to you individually, and three community cards in \"the flop\".\n\nCards are represented by objects like so:\n```\n{\n  val: 'Ace',\n  suit: 'Hearts'\n}\n```\n\nFor this kata you should implement three functions, each accepting the hole cards and the flop and returning a boolean value:\n\n**isPair()**: Should return `true` if there is a pair in the hand; two cards having the same `val`.\n\n**isTwoPair()**: Should return `true` if there are two distinct pairs; two cards sharing one `val`, and two cards sharing another.\n\n**isSet()**: Should return `true` if there is a three-of-a-kind in the hand; three cards sharing the same `val`.\n\nThese three classifications may overlap; for example, a hand with four-of-a-kind in it has a pair and a set, but not two pairs.\n\n## Example:\nIn the `hole` you have: \n```\n[ \n  {val: 'Ace', suit: 'Spades'}, \n  {val: '9', suit: 'Hearts'} \n]\n```\n\nand in the `flop` you have:\n```\n[\n  {val: '9', suit: 'Diamonds'}, \n  {val: 'Jack', suit: 'Hearts'}, \n  {val: '10', suit: 'Clubs'}\n]\n```\n\nBecause there are a pair of nines, but only one pair and no set:\n\n**isPair** - must return `true`.\n\n**isTwoPair** - must return `false`.\n\n**isSet** - must return `false`.",
