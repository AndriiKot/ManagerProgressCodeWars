  "description": "In mathematics, the factorial of integer `n` is written as `n!`. It is equal to the product of `n` and every integer preceding it. For example: `5! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120`\n\nYour mission is simple: write a function that takes an integer `n` and returns the value of `n!`.\n\nYou are guaranteed an integer argument. For any values outside the non-negative range, return `null`, `nil` or `None` (return an empty string `\"\"` in **C** and **C++**).  For non-negative numbers a full length number is expected for example, return `25! =  \"15511210043330985984000000\" ` as a string.\n\nFor more on factorials, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial\n\nNOTES: \n\n- The use of BigInteger or BigNumber functions has been disabled, this requires a complex solution\n\n- I have removed the use of require in the javascript language.\n",
