  "description": "# Balanced?\n\nUsually when we talk about converting between bases, we assume that the value assigned to the *characters* within the base are always the same; '3' in base 7 is the same as '3' in base 16. However, we could just as easily pick a different selection of values.\n\nSo, in balanced base nine, the characters will be as follows:\n- 0-4 will map onto 0-4 as you would expect\n- £, $, %, ^ will map onto -1, -2, -3, and -4 respectively\n\nThis leads to some interesting conversions. For example, `6 = 1%` because it is equal to `9 - 3`. Notice that all negative numbers can be represented without a negative sign as well.\n\n## The Goal\n\nYou must program a function that takes in a number and converts it to a string representing its *balanced base nine* form. For example, the number `26` as an input should return `3£`, and `-14` should return `$4`. Of course, your algorithm will have to cope with much bigger numbers.\n\n~~~if:javascript\nFor JS, input numbers will be `BigInt`s, to cope with values up to `10**120`.  \n( If operations on negative numbers do not give the results you expect, please consult documentation. )\n~~~",
