  "description": "It's important day today: the class has just had a math test. You will be given a list of marks. Complete the function that will:\n\n* Calculate the average mark of the whole class and round it to 3 decimal places.\n* Make a dictionary/hash with keys `\"h\", \"a\", \"l\"` to make clear how many `h`igh, `a`verage and `l`ow marks they got. High marks are 9 & 10, average marks are 7 & 8, and low marks are 1 to 6.\n* Return list `[class_average, dictionary]` if there are different type of marks, or `[class_average, dictionary, \"They did well\"]` if there are only high marks.\n\n## Examples\n```python\n[10, 9, 9, 10, 9, 10, 9] ==> [9.429, {'h': 7, 'a': 0, 'l': 0}, 'They did well']\n\n[5, 6, 4, 8, 9, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10] ==> [7.9, {'h': 5, 'a': 2, 'l': 3}]\n```\n```ruby\n[10, 9, 9, 10, 9, 10, 9] ==> [9.429, {'h': 7, 'a': 0, 'l': 0}, 'They did well']\n\n[5, 6, 4, 8, 9, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10] ==> [7.9, {'h': 5, 'a': 2, 'l': 3}]\n```",
