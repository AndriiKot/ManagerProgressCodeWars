  "description": "The magic sum of 3s is calculated on an array by summing up odd numbers which include the digit `3`.\n\nComplete the function which accepts an array of integers and returns its magic sum of 3s.\n\n*Example:* `[3, 12, 5, 8, 30, 13]` results in `16` (`3` + `13`)\n\nIf there is no such number in the array, `0` should be returned.",
