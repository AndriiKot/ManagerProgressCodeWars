  "description": "# Task\n You found two items in a treasure chest! The first item weighs `weight1` and is worth `value1`, and the second item weighs `weight2` and is worth `value2`. What is the total maximum value of the items you can take with you, assuming that your max weight capacity is `maxW`/`max_w` and you can't come back for the items later?\n\n# Example\n\n For `value1 = 10`, `weight1 = 5`, `value2 = 6`, `weight2 = 4` and `maxW = 8`, the output should be `10`.\n\n You can only carry the first item.\n\n For `value1 = 10`, `weight1 = 5`, `value2 = 6`, `weight2 = 4` and `maxW = 9`, the output should be `16`.\n\n You're strong enough to take both of the items with you.\n \n For `value1 = 10`, `weight1 = 10`, `value2 = 6`, `weight2 = 10` and `maxW = 9`, the output should be `0`.\n\n Unfortunately, you're not strong enough to take any one :(\n\n# Input/Output\n\n### Arguments\n\n- integer `value1`\n- integer `weight1`\n- integer `value1`\n- integer `weight1`\n- integer `maxW`/`max_w`\n\n#### Contraints \n\n- `$2 \\leq valueN \\leq 50$`\n- `$2 \\leq weightN \\leq 30$`\n- `$1 \\leq maxW \\leq 50$`\n\n### Output\n\n- integer representing the maximum value of the items that can be carried",
