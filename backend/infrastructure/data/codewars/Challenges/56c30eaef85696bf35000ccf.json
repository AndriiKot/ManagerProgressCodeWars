  "description": "Here your task is to <font size=\"+1\">Create a (nice) Christmas Tree</font>.<br><br>\nYou don't have to check errors or incorrect input values, every thing is ok without bad tricks, only one int parameter as input and a string to return;-)...<br><br> \n<u>So what to do?</u><br><br>First three easy examples:\n<br>\n````\nInput: 3 and Output:\n  *\n ***\n*****\n ###\n \n Input 9 and Output:\n    *\n   ***\n  *****\n   ***\n  *****\n *******\n  *****\n *******\n*********\n   ###\n   \n Input 17 and Output:\n      *\n     ***\n    *****\n     ***\n    *****\n   *******\n    *****\n   *******\n  *********\n   *******\n  *********\n ***********\n  *********\n ***********\n*************\n     ###\n     \nReally nice trees, or what???! So merry Christmas;-)\n````\n\nYou can see, always a root, always steps of hight 3, tree never smaller than 3 (return \"\") and no difference for input values like 15 or 17 (because (int) 15/3 = (int) 17/3). That's valid for every input and every tree. Lines are delimited by <code>\\r\\n</code> and no trailing white space allowed.\nI think there's nothing more to say - perhaps look at the testcases too;-)!\n\nThere are some static tests at the beginning and many random tests if you submit your solution.<br>&nbsp;<br>\n<h2><font color=\"red\">Hope you have fun:-)!</font></h2>\n",
