  "description": "The [Visitor Design Pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSEyIXnknoY) can be used, for example, to determine how an attack deals a different amount of damage to a unit in the StarCraft game.\n\nThe pattern consists of delegating the responsibility to a different class.\n\nWhen a unit takes damage it can tell the visitor what to do with itself.\n\n## Your Task\n\nComplete the code so that when a `Tank` attacks a `Marine` it takes `21` damage and when a `Tank` attacks a `Marauder` it takes `32` damage.\n\nThe Marine's initial health should be set to `100` and the Marauder's health should be set to `125`.\n\nYou have 3 classes:\n\n  - `Marine`: has a `health` property and `accept(visitor)` method\n  - `Marauder`: has a `health` property and `accept(visitor)` method\n  - `TankBullet`: the visitor class. Has `visitLight(unit)` and `visitArmored(unit)` methods\n\n## Ressources\n\n  - [PatternCraft > Visitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSEyIXnknoY)\n  - [SourceMaking > Visitor](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/visitor)\n  - [Wikipedia > Visitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern)\n\n# PatternCraft series\n\n  - [State Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-state/)\n  - [Strategy Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-strategy/)\n  - **Visitor Pattern**\n  - [Decorator Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-decorator/)\n  - [Adapter Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-adapter/)\n  - [Command Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-command/)\n\nThe original [PatternCraft series (by John Lindquist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8B19C3040F6381A2) is a collection of Youtube videos that explains some of the design patterns and how they are used (or could be) on StarCraft.",
