  "description": "Write a function name `nextPerfectSquare` / ```next_perfect_square``` that returns the first perfect square that is greater than its integer argument. A `perfect square` is a integer that is equal to some integer squared. For example 16 is a perfect square because `16=4*4`. \n```\nexample\n\nn   next perfect square\n\n6    9\n36   49 \n0    1\n-5   0 \n```\n```if-not:csharp\ncaution! the largest number tested is closer to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`\n```\n```if:csharp\nCaution!
