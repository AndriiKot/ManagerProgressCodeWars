  "description": "The number `23` is special in the sense that all of its digits are prime numbers. Furthermore, it's **a prime itself**. There are 4 such numbers between 10 and 100: `23, 37, 53, 73`. Let's call these numbers \"total primes\".\n\nComplete the function that takes a range (`a, b`) and returns the number of total primes within that range (a <= primes < b). The test ranges go up to 10<sup>7</sup>.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\n(10, 100)  ==> 4  # 23, 37, 53, 73\n(500, 600) ==> 3  # 523, 557, 577\n```\n```ruby\n(10, 100)  ==> 4  # 23, 37, 53, 73\n(500, 600) ==> 3  # 523, 557, 577\n```\n\nHappy coding!",
