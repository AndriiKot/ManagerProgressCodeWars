  "description": "You will write a program that takes 2 arrays of equal length integers as arguments.\nThe program must compare each element from the same index and add the highest of the 2 elements to a sum called assigned `highest`. It must also add the lowest of the 2 elements to a sum assigned `lowest`.\n\nIf both the elements being compared are the same value, nothing is added to either `highest` or `lowest`.\n\nThe program must return the highest and lowest sums respectively in an array (not a tuple).\n\n## Exceptions\nif the 2 arrays are not equal in length the program should return `\"error\"`.\n\n## Examples\n\n- `sortNsum([1,5,3,2], [7,3,7,3])` --> `[22 ,9]`\n- `sortNsum([10,1,3,4], [1,8,2,2])` --> `[25 ,6]`\n- `sortNsum([1,2,3,4], [4,3,2,1])` --> `[14 ,6]`\n- `sortNsum([1,2,2,2],[3,2,2,1])` --> `[5, 2]`\n- `sortNsum([1,2,2,2],[3,2,2])`, `\"error\"`\n\n\n",
