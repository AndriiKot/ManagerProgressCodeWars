  "description": "Your task is to write a regular expression (regex) that will match a string only if it contains at least one valid date, in the format `[mm-dd]` (that is, a two-digit month, followed by a dash, followed by a two-digit date, surrounded by square brackets).\n\nYou should assume the year in question is _not_ a leap year. Therefore, the number of days each month should have are as follows:\n\n- 1\\. January - 31 days\n- 2\\. February - 28 days (leap years are ignored)\n- 3\\. March - 31 days\n- 4\\. April - 30 days\n- 5\\. May - 31 days\n- 6\\. June - 30 days\n- 7\\. July - 31 days\n- 8\\. August - 31 days\n- 9\\. September - 30 days\n- 10\\. October - 31 days\n- 11\\. November - 30 days\n- 12\\. December - 31 days\n\nAll text outside a valid date can be ignored, including other _invalid_ dates.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\n\"[01-23]\" // January 23rd is a valid date\n\"[02-31]\" // February 31st is an invalid date\n\"[02-16]\" // valid\n\"[ 6-03]\" // invalid format\n\"ignored [08-11] ignored\" // valid\n\"[3] [12-04] [09-tenth]\" // December 4th is a valid date\n```\n",
