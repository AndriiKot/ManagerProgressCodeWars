  "description": "You have a string of numbers; starting with the third number each number is the result of an operation performed using the previous two numbers.\n\nComplete the function which returns a string of the operations in order and separated by a comma and a space, e.g. `\"subtraction, subtraction, addition\"`\n\nThe available operations are (in this order of preference):\n\n```\n1) addition\n2) subtraction\n3) multiplication\n4) division\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n* All input data is valid\n* The number of numbers in the input string >= 3\n* For a case like `\"2 2 4\"` - when multiple variants are possible - choose the first possible operation from the list (in this case `\"addition\"`)\n* Integer division should be used\n\n\n## Example\n\n```\n\"9 4 5 20 25\"  -->  \"subtraction, multiplication, addition\"\n``` \n\nBecause:\n\n``` \n9 - 4 = 5   --> subtraction\n4 * 5 = 20  --> multiplication\n5 + 20 = 25 --> addition\n```\n\n",
