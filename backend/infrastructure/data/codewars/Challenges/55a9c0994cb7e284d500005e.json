  "description": "![Queue](http://www.stoimen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2.-Queue-Operations.png)\n\n# Queues are linear collections of objects that can be inserted and removed in a FIFO (first in, first out) manner. \n\n---\n\n> An example of a queue in real life and not strictly computing would simply be the dreaded waiting line, i.e.the first person in line is also the first one who gets out. \n\n![Waiting Lines](http://blog.lavi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/waiting-in-line-1024x339.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## In this problem, we are going to be implementing our own ***enqueue***, ***dequeue***, and ***size*** methods for the queue constructor we are creating, so we should be able to create new instances of the Queue.\n\n- The `enqueue` method takes in the item as a parameter, while the `dequeue` method does not.\n- The `size` method simply returns the number of items in the queue. \n\n---\n\n## Wait, what?\n\n- To **enqueue** an item into the queue means to **insert** an item into the back, or **tail**, of the queue.\n- To **dequeue** an item means means  to **remove** the item at the front, or **head**, of the queue.\n- In a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.\n\n---\n\n### JavaScript Methodology\n\nQueues can be implemented in JavaScript using **arrays**. \n\nYou can use the built in [push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) or [unshift](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/unshift) functions in order to add items to the queue array as well as the [shift](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift) or [pop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop) to remove them.\n\nAs long as the tests pass, go for it!\n\n---\n\n> [Source 1](http://code.stephenmorley.org/javascript/queues/)\n>\n> [Source 2](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Stacks%20and%20Queues/Stacks%20and%20Queues.html)",
