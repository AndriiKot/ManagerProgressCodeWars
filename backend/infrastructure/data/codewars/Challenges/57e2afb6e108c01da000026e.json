  "description": "Math hasn't always been your best subject, and these programming symbols always trip you up! I mean, does `**` mean _\"Times, Times\"_ or _\"To the power of\"_? Luckily, you can create the function to write out the expressions for you!\n\nThe operators you'll need to use are:\n\n```\n\"+\"   -->  \"Plus\"\n\"-\"   -->  \"Minus\"\n\"*\"   -->  \"Times\"\n\"/\"   -->  \"Divided By\"\n\"**\"  -->  \"To The Power Of\"\n\"=\"   -->  \"Equals\"\n\"!=\"  -->  \"Does Not Equal\"\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n* the input will always be given as a string, in the following format: `number space operator space number`; for example: `\"1 + 3\"` or `\"2 - 10\"`\n* the numbers used will be `1` to `10`\n* the valid operators and the relevant texts are stored in the preloaded dictionary/hash `OPERATORS`\n* **invalid operators will also be tested**, to which you should return `\"That's not an operator!\"`\n\n\n### Examples\n\n```\n\"4 ** 9\"  -->  \"Four To The Power Of Nine\"\n\"10 - 5\"  -->  \"Ten Minus Five\"\n\"2 = 2\"   -->  \"Two Equals Two\"\n\"2 x 3\"   -->  \"That's not an operator!\"\n```\n\nGood luck!",
