  "description": "### Description\n\nGiven a `posts` table that contains a `created_at` timestamp column write a query that returns a first date of the month, a number of posts created in a given month and a month-over-month growth rate.\n\nThe resulting set should be ordered chronologically by `date`.\n\n**Note:**\n\n - percent growth rate can be negative\n - percent growth rate should be rounded to one digit after the decimal point and immediately followed by a percent symbol \"%\". See the desired output below for the reference.\n\n### Desired Output\n\nThe resulting set should look similar to the following:\n\n```\ndate       | count | percent_growth\n-----------+-------+---------------\n2016-02-01 |   175 |           null\n2016-03-01 |   338 |          93.1%\n2016-04-01 |   345 |           2.1%\n2016-05-01 |   295 |         -14.5%\n2016-06-01 |   330 |          11.9%\n...\n```\n\n* date - (DATE) a first date of the month\n* count - (INT) a number of posts in a given month\n* percent\\_growth - (TEXT) a month-over-month growth rate expressed in percents\n",
