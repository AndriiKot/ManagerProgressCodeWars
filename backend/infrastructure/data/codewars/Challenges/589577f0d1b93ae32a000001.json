  "description": "## Task\n Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. \n \n Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees.\n\n## Example\n\n For `a = [-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180]`, the output should be\n\n `[-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 180, 190]`.\n\n## Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer array `a`\n\n    If a[i] = -1, then the ith position is occupied by a tree. Otherwise a[i] is the height of a person standing in the ith position.\n\n    Constraints:\n\n    `5 ≤ a.length ≤ 30,`\n\n    `-1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 200.`\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer array\n\n    `Sorted` array a with all the trees untouched.",
