  "description": "You are given a ASCII diagram, comprised of minus signs `-`, plus signs `+`, vertical bars `|` and whitespaces `  `.  Your task is to write a function which breaks the diagram in the minimal pieces it is made of.\n\nFor example, if the input for your function is this diagram:\n\n```\n+------------+\n|            |\n|            |\n|            |\n+------+-----+\n|      |     |\n|      |     |\n+------+-----+\n```\n\nthe returned value should be the list of:\n\n```\n+------------+\n|            |\n|            |\n|            |\n+------------+\n```\n(note how it lost a `+` sign in the extraction)\n\nas well as\n\n```\n+------+\n|      |\n|      |\n+------+\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n+-----+\n|     |\n|     |\n+-----+\n```\n\n\nThe diagram is given as an ordinary multiline string. \nThere are no borders touching each others.\n\nThe pieces should not have trailing spaces at the end of the lines. However, it could have leading spaces if the figure is not a rectangle. For instance:\n\n```\n    +---+\n    |   |\n+---+   |\n|       |\n+-------+\n```\n\nHowever, it is not allowed to use more leading spaces than necessary. It is to say, the first character of some of the lines should be different than a space.\n\nFinally, note that only the explicitly closed pieces are considered.  Spaces \"outside\" of the shape are part of the background . Therefore the diagram above has a single piece.\n\n\nHave fun!\n\n\nNote : in C++ you are provided with two utility functions :\n```cpp\nstd::string join(const std::string &sep, const std::vector<std::string> &to_join); // Returns the concatenation of all the strings in the vector, separated with sep \n\nstd::vector<std::string> split_lines(const std::string &to_split); // Splits a string, using separator '\\n'\n```\n\n\n\n###### _Harder version of the kata available here:_ [_Break the Pieces (evilized edition)_](https://www.codewars.com/kata/break-the-pieces-evilized-edition)\n=======\n",
