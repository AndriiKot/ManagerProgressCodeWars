  "description": "Write a function that tells you when is the next train to Brighton you can take, given the time of day and the minutes it takes you to get to the station. \n\nThere is one train every half an hour from 05:00 to 23:30. \n\nThe current time is represented by a string in the format \"hh:mm\". The minutes you need to arrive at the station are also represented by a string. \n\nThe result is a string that says \"The next train is at hh:mm\" (see examples below). \n\nIf it's too late for the last train of the day (e.g. it's 23:50 and you need 40 minutes to get to the station), the function returns \"The next train is at 05:00.\". \n\nEXAMPLES \n\n```javascript \nnextTrain(\"17:40\", \"30\") => \"The next train is at 18:30.\"\nnextTrain(\"23:20\", \"25\") => \"The next train is at 05:00.\"\nnextTrain(\"03:36\", \"95\") => \"The next train is at 05:30.\"\n```\n\n",
