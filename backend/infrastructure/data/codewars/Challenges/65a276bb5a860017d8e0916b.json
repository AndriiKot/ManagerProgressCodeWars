  "description": "**How Far Is Your Enemy?**\n\nImagine a 2 dimensional plane, and on that plane there are 2 points. The first point is you and the second point is your enemy. Now, you know both of these point's coordinates and you need to calculate the distance between these two points.\n\nTo do this you need to use the pythagorean theorem: C^2 = A^2 + B^2\n\n\n```\n          Point 1\n            │\n            ▼\n            │\\\nHeight   ──►│ \\ c\nDifference a│  \\ ◄──Distance Between Points\n            │   \\\n            └────\\◄──Point 2\n             ▲ b\n             │\n             │\n          Length\n          Difference\n```\n\nSo by just knowing the height and length difference between two points, you can calculate the distance between them.\n\n\n**How Should The Code Work?**\n\nWell, there is a function named calcDistance with 2 parameters, you and enemy. these are objects containing x and y coordinates. You need to return the distance between you and enemy.\n\nHappy Coding!",
