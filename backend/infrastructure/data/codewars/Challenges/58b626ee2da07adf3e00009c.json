  "description": "# Task\n Mr.Nam has `n` candies, he wants to put one candy in each cell of a table-box. The table-box has `r` rows and `c` columns.\n\n Each candy was labeled by its cell number. The cell numbers are in range from 1 to N and the direction begins from right to left and from bottom to top.\n\n Nam wants to know the position of a specific `candy` and which box is holding it.\n\n The result should be an array and contain exactly 3 elements. The first element is the `label` of the table; The second element is the `row` of the candy; The third element is the `column` of the candy.\n \n If there is no candy with the given number, return `[-1, -1, -1]`.\n\n Note: \n \n When the current box is filled up, Nam buys another one. \n \n The boxes are labeled from `1`.\n\n Rows and columns are `0`-based numbered from left to right and from top to bottom.\n \n# Example\n\n For `n=6,r=2,c=2,candy=3`, the result should be `[1,0,1]`\n \n the candies will be allocated like this:\n \n```\nBox 1\n+-----+-----+\n|  4  | (3) | --> box 1,row 0, col 1\n+-----+-----+\n|  2  |  1  |\n+-----+-----+\nBox 2\n+-----+-----+\n|  x  |  x  |\n+-----+-----+\n|  6  | (5) | --> box 2,row 1, col 1\n+-----+-----+\n```\n\n For `candy = 5(n,r,c same as above)`, the output should be `[2,1,1]`.\n \n For `candy = 7(n,r,c same as above)`, the output should be `[-1,-1,-1]`.\n \n For `n=8,r=4,c=2,candy=3`, the result should be `[1,2,1]` \n \n```\nBox 1\n+-----+-----+\n|  8  |  7  |\n+-----+-----+\n|  6  |  5  |\n+-----+-----+\n|  4  | (3) |--> box 1,row 2, col 1\n+-----+-----+\n|  2  |  1  |\n+-----+-----+\n```\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `n`\n\n  The number of candies. \n  \n  `0 < n <= 100`\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `r`\n\n  The number of rows. \n  \n  `0 < r <= 100`\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `c`\n\n The number of columns.\n\n `0 < c <= 100`\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `candy`\n\n The label of the candy Nam wants to get position of.\n \n `0 < c <= 120`\n\n - `[output]` an integer array\n\n  Array of 3 elements: a label, a row and a column.",
