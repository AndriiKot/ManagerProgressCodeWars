  "description": "You need to create a function that calculates the number of weekdays\n(Monday through Friday) between two dates inclusively.\n\nThe function should be named `weekdays` accept two arguments of type `DATE` and return an `INTEGER` value.\n\n```sql\nweekdays(DATE, DATE) INTEGER\n```\n\nThe order of arguments shouldn't matter. To illustrate both of the following queries\n\n```sql\nSELECT weekdays('2016-01-01', '2016-01-10');\nSELECT weekdays('2016-01-10', '2016-01-01');\n```\nshould produce the same result\n\n```sh\n weekdays\n----------\n        6\n(1 row)\n```\n",
