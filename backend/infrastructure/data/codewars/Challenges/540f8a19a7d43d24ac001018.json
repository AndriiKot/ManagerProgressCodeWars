  "description": "# Introduction\n\nA sequence is usually a set or an array of numbers that has a strict way for moving from the nth term to the (n+1)th term.\n\nIf `f(n) = f(n-1) + c` where `c` is a constant value, then `f` is an arithmetic sequence.\n\nAn example would be (where the first term is 0 and the constant is 1) is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... and so on]`\n\nElse if `f(n) = f(n-1) * c` where `c` is a constant value, then `f` is a geometric sequence.\n\nExample where the first term is 2 and the constant is 2 will be `[2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ... to infinity ... ]`\n\nThere are some other sequences that aren't arithmetic nor are they geometric.\n\nHere is a link to feed your brain! : [Sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence)\n\n---\n\n# Task\n\nYou're going to write a function that's going to return the **value in the nth index of an arithmetic sequence**. (That is, adding a constant to move to the next element in the \"sequence\").\n\nThe function takes three inputs `first`,`n`,`c` where:\n\n  - `first` is the first value in the index `0`.\n  - `n` is the index of the value we want.\n  - `c` is the constant added between each term.\n\nRemember that `first` is in the index `0` .. just saying ...",
