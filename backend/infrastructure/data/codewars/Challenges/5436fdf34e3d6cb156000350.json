  "description": "# Create any card game!\nCreate a Card Game library of classes which could be used to create any number of basic card games. You'll need at least a `Deck` class and a `Card` class.\n\n### Deck functionality\nA deck has a public attribute:\n\n  `cards`: array of remaining cards in the deck.\n\n...and three public methods:\n\n  `count()`: count of remaining cards in the deck.\n\n  `shuffle()`: randomize the order of the remaining cards in the deck.\n\n  `draw(n)`: remove the last `n` cards from the deck and return them in an array.\n\nUpon initialization, a deck is filled with 52 cards (13 from each of 4 suits).\n\n### Card functionality\nA card has these public attributes:\n\n*  `suit`: a symbol representing the suit of the card.\n\n*  `rank`: an integer from 1 to 13. (\"ace\" is 1, \"king\" is 13)\n  \n*  **Javascript**: `face_card`: is this card a face card? (> 10)\n\n...and these methods:\n\n* **Ruby**: `face_card?`: is this card a face card? (> 10)\n\n* `to_s` (**JS**:`toString()`) : human-readable string representation of the card (e.g. \"Ace of Spades\", \"10 of Clubs\", \"Queen of Hearts\")\n  \n\nCards must be `Comparable` to other cards. Compare the ranks of the cards only.\n\nSince this is a low level layer to build card games above, all test input will be valid. \nAll ranks will be between 1 and 13 and all suits will be one of \n\n* **Ruby**: `:hearts`, `:diamonds`, `:spades`, `:clubs`\n* **Javascript**: `Card.HEARTS`, `Card.DIAMONDS`, `Card.CLUBS`, `Card.SPADES`\n",
