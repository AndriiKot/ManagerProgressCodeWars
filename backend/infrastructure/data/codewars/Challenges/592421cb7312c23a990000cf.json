  "description": "The look and say sequence is a sequence in which each number is the result of a \"look and say\" operation on the previous element.\n\nConsidering for example the classical version startin with `\"1\"`: `[\"1\", \"11\", \"21, \"1211\", \"111221\", ...]`. You can see that the second element describes the first as `\"1(times number)1\"`, the third is `\"2(times number)1\"` describing the second, the fourth is `\"1(times number)2(and)1(times number)1\"` and so on.\n\nYour goal is to create a function which takes a starting string (not necessarily the classical `\"1\"`, much less a single character start) and return the nth element of the series.\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\n \"1\",  1 --> \"1\"\n \"1\",  3 --> \"21\"\n \"1\",  5 --> \"111221\"\n\"22\", 10 --> \"22\"\n\"14\",  2 --> \"1114\"\n```\n\nTrivia: `\"22\"` is the only element that can keep the series constant.",
