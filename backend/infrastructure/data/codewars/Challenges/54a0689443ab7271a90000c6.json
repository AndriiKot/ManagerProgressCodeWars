  "description": "[Harshad numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshad_number) (also called Niven numbers) are positive numbers that can be divided (without remainder) by the sum of their digits.\n\nFor example, the following numbers are Harshad numbers:\n\n* 10, because 1 + 0 = 1 and 10 is divisible by 1\n* 27, because 2 + 7 = 9 and 27 is divisible by 9\n* 588, because 5 + 8 + 8 = 21 and 588 is divisible by 21\n\nWhile these numbers are not:\n\n* 19, because 1 + 9 = 10 and 19 is not divisible by 10\n* 589, because 5 + 8 + 9 = 22 and 589 is not divisible by 22\n* 1001, because 1 + 1 = 2 and 1001 is not divisible by 2\n\nHarshad numbers can be found in any number base, but we are going to focus on base 10 exclusively.\n\n\n## Your task\n\nYour task is to complete the skeleton Harshad object (\"static class\") which has 3 functions:\n\n* ```isValid()``` that checks if `n` is a Harshad number or not\n* ```getNext()``` that returns the next Harshad number > `n`\n* ```getSerie()``` that returns a series of `n` Harshad numbers, optional `start` value not included\n\nYou do not need to care about the passed parameters in the test cases, they will always be valid integers (except for the start argument in `getSerie()` which is optional and should default to `0`).\n\n\n**Note:** only the first 2000 Harshad numbers will be checked in the tests.\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nHarshad.isValid(1)         ==>  true\nHarshad.getNext(0)         ==>  1\nHarshad.getSerie(3)        ==>  [ 1, 2, 3 ]\nHarshad.getSerie(3, 1000)  ==>  [ 1002, 1008, 1010 ]\n```\n```ruby\nHarshad.is_valid(1)         ==>  true\nHarshad.get_next(0)         ==>  1\nHarshad.get_serie(3)        ==>  [ 1, 2, 3 ]\nHarshad.get_serie(3, 1000)  ==>  [ 1002, 1008, 1010 ]\n```\n```python\nHarshad.is_valid(1)          ==>  True\nHarshad.get_next(0)          ==>  1\nHarshad.get_series(3)        ==>  [ 1, 2, 3 ]\nHarshad.get_series(3, 1000)  ==>  [ 1002, 1008, 1010 ]\n```",
