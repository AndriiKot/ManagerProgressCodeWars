  "description": "\n## Lore: \n\nIn RE4 there are different types of enemies, all bent on killing you but there is one in particular called **\"The Regenerator\"** that you need to be able to see in infrared to know where to shoot because if you shoot the wrong part of the body it will regenerate due to multiple parasites that live inside the body of the regenerator.\n\n**Leon**, our character, has an infrared scope that helps him detect these parasites, but he has lost it! Help him detect the correct places where he should shoot.\n\n## Rules: \n\nIt is necessary to write a function that receives a string and returns an array of numbers with the **'P'** indices of the parasites within the string.\n\nIf the string is empty, the function should return **'Aim well Lion!'**\n\nIf the string does not contain (P) the function should return **'Wait! that is not a regenerator!'**\n\nThe function is case insensitive so it can receive **'p'** or **'P'**\n\nP = Parasite\n\nExamples: \n\n`shootHere('SPHBSLEPAFS'); // should return [1, 7]`\n\n`shootHere('BeSSlhF'); // should return 'Wait! that is not a regenerator!'`\n\n`shootHere(''); // should return 'Aim well Lion!'`\n\n\n",
