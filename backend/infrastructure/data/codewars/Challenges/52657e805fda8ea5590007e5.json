  "description": "In this kata, you have to break a code of 3 digits. The tryCode() function is called in loop with a max of 10 attempts. It have to return an array of 3 digits.\n    \nDuring the first call, the \"indications\" parameter is null, then it is the result array of the confrontation between last proposition and solution. You may have 3 different values: \n\n- 0 means the proposed digit is correct\n\n- 1 means the proposed digit is lower than the correct one\n\n- -1 means the proposed digit is higher than the correct one\n\n\nPseudo-algorithm example :\n\n- solution is randomly created, in this example this [1,2,3]\n\n- tryCode(null) => [0, 2, 4] // for the first call, indications is null, we assume that it returns [0,2,4]\n\n- tryCode([1, 0, -1]) // [0, 2, 4] isn't the solution, so tryCode() is called again, with the indications [1, 0, -1] as explained above : 0 below 1 => 1 ; 2 == 2 => 0 ; 4 above 3 => -1\n\n- ...so on, until tryCode() returns the solution or it is called up to 10 times (to avoid a brute force)",
