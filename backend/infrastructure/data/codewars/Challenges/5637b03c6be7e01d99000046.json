  "description": "One suggestion to build a satisfactory password is to start with a memorable phrase or sentence and make a password by extracting the first letter of each word. \n\nEven better is to replace some of those letters with numbers (e.g., the letter `O` can be replaced with the number `0`):\n\n* instead of including `i` or `I` put the number `1` in the password;\n* instead of including `o` or `O` put the number `0` in the password;\n* instead of including `s` or `S` put the number `5` in the password.\n\n\n## Examples:\n```\n\"Give me liberty or give me death\"  --> \"Gml0gmd\"\n\"Keep Calm and Carry On\"            --> \"KCaC0\"\n```",
