  "description": "We have the `messages` table that has the following structure:\n\n* `id` (integer) - primary key\n* `message` (text) - message with or without 'apple` occurencies\n\nThe table contains textual messages. Your task is to identify messages where the word \"apple\" appears at least twice, even if it's within a larger word like \"apples\" (regardless of word boundaries) The search should be case-insensitive, meaning \"Apple\", \"APPLE\", and \"aPpLe\" should all be treated as valid occurrences of the word \"apple\".\n\nThe query should return three columns:\n\n1) `id`\n2) `message`: The full message text.\n3) `second_occurrence_position`: The position (starting index) of the second occurrence of the word \"apple\" in the message. Keep im mind that in PostgreSQL, string indexing starts at 1, not 0. So the first character of a string is at position 1.\n\nOnly messages with at least two occurrences of the word \"apple\" should be returned. The result should be ordered by `id` in descending order.\n\nGLHF!",
