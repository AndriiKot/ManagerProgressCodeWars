  "description": "In order to prove it's success and gain funding, the wilderness zoo needs to prove to environmentalists that it has x number of mating pairs of bears. \n\n### Task:\nYou must check within a string (s) to find all of the mating pairs, returning a list/array of the string containing valid mating pairs and a boolean indicating whether the ***total*** number of bears is greater than or equal to x.\n\n### Rules for a 'valid' mating pair:\n1. Bears are either 'B' (male) or '8' (female),\n2. Bears must be together in male/female pairs 'B8' or '8B',\n3. Mating pairs must involve two distinct bears each ('B8B' may look fun, but does not count as two pairs).\n\nReturn an array containing a string of the valid mating pairs available (empty string if there are no pairs), and a boolean indicating whether the ***total*** number of bears is greater than or equal to x. , e.g:\n\n(6, 'EvHB8KN8ik8BiyxfeyKBmiCMj') ---> ['B88B', false]; *in this example, the number of bears(=4) is lesser than the given value of x(=6)*\n\n",
