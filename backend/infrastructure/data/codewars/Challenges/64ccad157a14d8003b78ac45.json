  "description": "You are working with a database that contains information about various products supplied by different suppliers. The database has a table named `products`, which has the following schema:\n\n* `id`: (integer) - Primary key\n* `supplier_id`: (integer) – The unique identifier for each supplier.\n* `product_name`: (varchar) – The name of the product.\n* `quantity`: (integer) – The quantity of the product in stock.\n\nWrite a SQL query to find the total count of rows for each supplier, representing the total number of products (regardless of product name) for each supplier. Your query must not use the GROUP BY clause. But results should be exactly the same as in the query with Group By:\n\n```\nselect supplier_id, count(id) as total_products\nfrom products\ngroup by supplier_id\norder by supplier_id desc;\n```\n\nYour query must return exactly two columns:\n\n* `supplier_id`: The unique identifier for the supplier.\n* `total_products`: The total number of products for that supplier.\n\nResult set should be ordered by `supplier_id` in descending order.\n\nGLHF!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
