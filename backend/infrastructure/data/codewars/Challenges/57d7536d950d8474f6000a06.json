  "description": "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ta6gv1i.png?1\" title=\"cw weekly challenge\" />\n\nHave you ever noticed that cows in a field are always facing in the same direction?\n\nReference: http://bfy.tw/7fgf\n\n<hr>\n\nWell.... not quite always.\n\nOne stubborn cow wants to be different from the rest of the herd - it's that damn *Wrong-Way Cow!*\n\n# Task\n\nGiven a field of cows find which one is the Wrong-Way Cow and return her position.\n\nNotes:\n\n* There are always at least 3 cows in a herd\n* There is only 1 Wrong-Way Cow!\n* Fields are rectangular\n* The cow position is zero-based [x,y] of her head (i.e. the letter c)\n* There are no _diagonal_ cows -- they only face North/South/East/West (i.e. up/down/right/left)\n\n# Examples\n\nEx1\n<pre style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">\ncow.cow.cow.cow.cow\ncow.cow.cow.cow.cow\ncow.<span style=\"background:red\">woc</span>.cow.cow.cow\ncow.cow.cow.cow.cow\n</pre>\n\n*Answer: [6,2]*\n\nEx2\n<pre style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">\nc..........\no...c......\nw...o.c....\n....w.o....\n......w.<span style=\"background:red\">cow</span>\n</pre>\n\n*Answer: [8,4]*\n\n# Notes\n\n*The test cases will NOT test any situations where there are \"imaginary\" cows, so your solution does not need to worry about such things!*\n\nTo explain - Yes, I recognise that there are certain configurations where an \"imaginary\" cow may appear that in fact is just made of three other \"real\" cows. In the following field you can see there are 4 real cows (3 are facing south and 1 is facing north). There are also 2 imaginary cows (facing east and west). \n\nBut such a field will never be tested by this Kata.\n\n<pre style=\"margin-bottom:20px\">\n...w...\n..cow..\n.woco..\n.ow.c..\n.c.....\n</pre>\n\n\n\n",
