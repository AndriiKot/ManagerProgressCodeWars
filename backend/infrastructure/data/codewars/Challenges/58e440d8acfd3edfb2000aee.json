  "description": "This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.\n\n`Vector` objects (`struct` in C) have `x`, `y`, and `z` attributes. `x`, `y` and `z` are floating-point numbers.\n\nWrite a function calculating the cross product of `Vector a` and `Vector b`, the result should be a `Vector` object.\n\n[You can read more about cross product on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product).",
