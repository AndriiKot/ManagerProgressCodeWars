  "description": "### Celebrity Baby Names\n\nCelebrities love to call their children quirky names. The latest trend for baby names is the 'last letter trend'. The rules of the trend are as follows: the first letter of a child's name should be the same as the last letter of their older sibling. For example:\n\nSuri (1st child), Ireland (2nd child), Diva (3rd child), Aleph (4th child)\n\nAnd so on...\n\nCreate a function validName which accepts an array of names. It should return ```\"Congratulations, your baby names are compatible!\"``` if all of the names follow the rule. It should return ```\"Back to the drawing board, your baby names are not compatible.\"``` if any of the names do not follow the rule.\n\nIf a couple only has one child, it should return ```\"Congratulations, you can choose any name you like!\"```\n\nIf the array is empty, it should return ```\"You must test at least one name.\"```\n\n#### Notes:\n- Names may be hyphenated or two words e.g. Blue Ivy or Jean-Paul\n- Names will not include any other characters apart from letters, hyphens or spaces.\n",
