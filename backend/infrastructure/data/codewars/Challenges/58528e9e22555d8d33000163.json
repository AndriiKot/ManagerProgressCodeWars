He wants to know how many minutes he has left to work on his new project.<br> He doesn't want to look on the clock all the time, so he thought about a function, which returns him the number of minutes.<br>\n<br>\n<code>Can you write him a function, so he can stay productive?</code>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>The function <code>minutesToMidnight(d)</code> will take a date object as parameter. Return the number of minutes in the following format:</b> <br><br>\n<code><b>\"x minute(s)\"</b></code>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou will always get a date object with of today with a random timestamp. <br>\nYou have to round the number of minutes. <br>\nMilliseconds doesn't matter!\n\n<code>\nSome examples:<br>\n<br>\n10.00 am => \"840 minutes\"<br>\n23.59 pm => \"1 minute\"\n</code>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>This kata is part of the Collection \"Date fundamentals\":</b>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/count-the-days/javascript\">#1 Count the Days!</a></li>\n<li>#2 Minutes to Midnight</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/can-santa-save-christmas\">#3 Can Santa save Christmas?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/christmas-present-calculator\">#4 Christmas Present Calculator</a></li>\n</ul>",
