  "description": "This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.\n\n`Point` objects have x, y attributes. `Circle` objects have `center` which is a `Point`, and `radius`, which is a number.\n\nWrite a function calculating circumference of a `Circle`.\n\nTests round answers to 6 decimal places.",
