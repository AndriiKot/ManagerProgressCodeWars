  "description": "Your computer has forgotten how to speak ASCII! (or Unicode, whatever)\nIt can only communicate in binary, and it has something important to tell you.\nWrite a function which will receive a long string of binary code and convert it to a string. Remember, in Python binary output starts with '0b'.\n\nAs an example: `binary_to_string('0b10000110b11000010b1110100') == 'Cat'`\n\nInput may consist of upper and lower case letters and numbers, in binary form of course, as well as special symbols.\nThe input to your function will always be one string of binary.\n\n~~~if:fortran\n*NOTE: In Fortran, your returned string may* **not** *contain redundant leading/trailing whitespace.  You may also assume that the input string will not contain redundant leading/trailing whitespace.*\n~~~",
