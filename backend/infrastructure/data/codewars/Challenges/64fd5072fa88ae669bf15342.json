  "description": "### Task\n\nHeading off to the **Tree Arboretum of Various Heights**, I bring along my camera to snap up a few photos. Ideally, I'd want to take a picture of as many trees as possible, but the taller trees may cover up the shorter trees behind it.\n\nA tree is hidden if it is **shorter than** or the **same height as** a ( any ) tree in front of it, as seen in a particular direction.\n\nGiven a list of tree heights, create a function which returns `\"left\"` or `\"right\"`, depending on which side allows me to see as many trees as possible.\n\n### Worked Example\n\n```\n[1, 3, 1, 6, 5] ➞ \"left\"\n// If I stand on the left, I can see trees of heights 1, 3 and 6.\n// If I stand on the right, I can see trees of heights 5 and 6.\n// Return \"left\" because I would see more trees.\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n```\n[5, 6, 5, 4] ➞ \"right\"\n\n[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] ➞ \"left\"\n\n[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6] ➞ \"left\"\n```\n\n### Notes\n\nThere will always be a best side.",
