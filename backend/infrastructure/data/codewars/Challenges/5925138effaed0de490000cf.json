  "description": "# Task\nSome children are playing rope skipping game. Children skip the rope at roughly the same speed: `once per second`. If the child fails during the jump, he needs to tidy up the rope and continue. This will take `3 seconds`.\n\nYou are given an array sorted in ascending order, where each element is a jump count after which the child failed. This is a running total, meaning that each count includes the jumps before it.\n\nFor example `[12, 23, 45]` means that the child failed 3 times while playing: after the 12th jump, after the 23rd jump, and after the 45th jump.\n\nYour task is to calculate how many times the child jumped in `60` seconds.\n\nNote: The children keep going until they have made at least `60` *jumps*, even if it takes them longer than `60` *seconds*.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n`[input]` integer array `failedCount`\n\n`0 ≤ failedCount.length ≤ 60`\n\n`1 ≤ failedCount[i] ≤ 60`\n\n`[output]` an integer\n\nhow many times the child jumped in 60 seconds.\n\n\n# Example\n\nFor `failedCount = []`, the output should be `60`.\n\nThere is no mistake in the game process. So the child jumped 60 times in 60 seconds.\n\nFor `failedCount = [12, 23, 45]`, the output should be `51`.\n```\nThe 1st mistake occurred when he jumped 12 times. --> 12 seconds past.\nTidy up the rope and continue.                    --> 15 seconds past.\nThe 2nd mistake occurred when he jumped 23 times. --> 26 seconds past.\nTidy up the rope and continue.                    --> 29 seconds past.\nThe 3rd mistake occurred when he jumped 45 times. --> 51 seconds past.\nTidy up the rope and continue.                    --> 54 seconds past.\nWhen he jumped 51 times                           --> 60 seconds past.\n```",
