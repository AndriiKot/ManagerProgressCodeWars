  "description": "If you're an experienced Java programmer, you've likely come across `List.of`, but it often frustrates newcomers since the returned list is\nimmutable and doesn’t allow adding, removing, or modifying elements. This happens because the object implements the `java.util.List`\ninterface but delegates its method calls to another implementation behind the scenes, demonstrating the Adapter pattern that allows\ndifferent interfaces\nto work together by translating method calls.\n\nYour task is to create a method that takes an array (or varargs) and returns a `List` structure that keeps the data immutable, similar to\nhow `List.of` works.\n\nYou cannot use:\n - List.of\n - any method named .of\n - the new operator, except when creating Exceptions\n\nYou can find more info on [List.of()](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html#of()) in the Java docs.",
