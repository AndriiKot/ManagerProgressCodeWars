  "description": "Given 2 elevators (named \"left\" and \"right\") in a building with 3 floors (numbered `0` to `2`), write a function accepting 3 arguments (in order):\n\n- `left` - The current floor of the left elevator\n- `right` - The current floor of the right elevator\n- `call` -  The floor that called an elevator\n\nIt should return the name of the elevator closest to the called floor (`\"left\"`/`\"right\"`).\n\nIn the case where both elevators are equally distant from the called floor, choose the elevator to the right.\n\nYou can assume that the inputs will always be valid integers between 0-2.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nleft right call   result\n  0    1     0    \"left\"\n  0    1     1    \"right\"\n  0    1     2    \"right\"\n  0    0     0    \"right\"\n  0    2     1    \"right\"\n```\n",
