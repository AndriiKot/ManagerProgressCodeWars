  "description": "\n<h1> Introduction </h1>\n\nAs you go about your day in college, you spot your **crush** in the mathematics department doing some work on her master's thesis.\n\nShyly, you approach her and ask what she is doing.\n\n> I'm trying to solve this infinite series, but I can't figure out a way to generalize it for other values of ```n```. Here, take a look:\n\n```math\nf(n) = \\sum_{k = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac {k^{n}}{2^{k}}\n```\n\n> If only someone knew a way to compute its higher-order terms, it would be extremely helpful to get to know its growth rate, even if experimentally.\n\nSpotting an opportunity to impress her, you decide to lend a helping hand in the matter. *\"Don't fret, m'lady, I have what it takes to take on such a challenge,\"*  you say in the creepiest and most incel way possible.\n\n> Thanks, I guess...\n\nAfter creeping out your crush into accepting your help, you confidently walk away to tackle the matter, hearing a sigh of relief as you leave...\n\n<br>\n<h1> Task </h1>\n\nGiven an integer ```n``` between ```0``` and ```800``` as input, write a function ```sequence``` that computes the *nth* term of the sequence defined by:\n\n```math\nf(n) = \\sum_{k = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac {k^{n}}{2^{k}}\n```\n\nHint: All of its values are integers.\n\n<br>\n<h1> Anti Cheat </h1>\n\nIn order to prevent one from hardcoding all the values, there is a character cap set at ```1000``` characters.\n\nUnless you're trying to cheese this kata, you really shouldn't worry about this limit, as 1 thousand characters is way more than enough to solve it.\n\n\n<br>\n<h1> Examples </h1>\n\n```python\nsequence(0) -> 1\nsequence(1) -> 2\nsequence(2) -> 6\n```",
