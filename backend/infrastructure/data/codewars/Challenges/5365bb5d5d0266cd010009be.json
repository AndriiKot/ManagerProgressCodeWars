  "description": "# Making Change\n\nComplete the method that will determine the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount in American currency.\n\nCoins used will be half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, worth 50¢, 25¢, 10¢, 5¢ and 1¢, respectively. They'll be represented by the symbols/strings `H`, `Q`, `D`, `N` and `P`.\n\nThe argument passed in will be an integer representing the value in cents. The return value should be a hash/dictionary/object with the symbols as keys, and the numbers of coins as values. Coins that are not used should not be included in the hash. If the argument passed in is 0, then the method should return an empty hash.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```\ninput = 0  => output = {}\ninput = 1  => output = {'P': 1}\ninput = 43 => output = {'Q': 1, 'D': 1, 'N': 1, 'P': 3}\ninput = 91 => output = {'H': 1, 'Q': 1, 'D': 1, 'N': 1, 'P': 1}\n```\n\n#### **If you liked this kata, check out [Part 2](https://www.codewars.com/kata/making-change-part-2).**\n",
