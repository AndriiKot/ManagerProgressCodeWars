  "description": "For every string, after every occurrence of `'and'` and/or `'but'`, insert the substring `'apparently'` directly after the occurrence(s).\n\nIf input does not contain 'and' or 'but', return the same string. If a blank string, return `''`.\n\nIf substring `'apparently'` is already directly after an `'and'` and/or `'but'`, do not add another. (Do not add duplicates).\n\n\n# Examples:\n\nInput 1 \n\n    'It was great and I've never been on live television before but sometimes I don't watch this.'\n\nOutput 1\n\n    'It was great and apparently I've never been on live television before but apparently sometimes I don't watch this.'\n\nInput 2\n\n    'but apparently'\n\nOutput 2\n\n    'but apparently' \n(no changes because `'apparently'` is already directly after `'but'` and there should not be a duplicate.)\n\nAn occurrence of `'and'` and/or `'but'` only counts when it is at least one space separated. For example `'andd'` and `'bbut'` do not count as occurrences, whereas `'b but'` and `'and d'` does count.\n\nreference that may help:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz5TGN7eUcM\n",
