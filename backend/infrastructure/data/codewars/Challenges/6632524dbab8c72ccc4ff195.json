  "description": "Problem Description:\n\nAs a MotoGP commentator, you're tasked with interpreting qualifying results to determine each racer's starting position on the grid. The grid is organized into rows of three racers each, with positions within a row not aligned. Every rider in a row starts a little forward from the next rider. The lowest position number marks the top of the row, while the highest indicates the bottom, with the middle position between them.\n\nWrite a function that takes the name of a racer and their qualifying position as input and returns a string indicating their starting position on the grid.\n\nExample grid:\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/ogBU5QvvK6vd5k2j9\n\nFunction Specifications:\n\n**Input:** A string representing the racer's name and an integer indicating their qualifying position.  \n**Output:** A string describing the racer's starting position on the grid in the specified format.  \n\n**Example Input:** 'Valentino Rossi', 11  \n**Example Output:** 'Valentino Rossi starts from the middle of the 4th row  \n\n**Exceptions:** \n- If position is 1 then the text should be '[Rider Name] starts from pole position'\n- If the racer qualifies in the 1st row, the output should use \"front row\" instead. \n\n**Example Input:** 'Jorge Martin, 2  \n**Example Output:** 'Jorge Martin starts from the middle of the front row'  \n\nDon't worry about validating the input. Rider name is always a string. Position is a number between 1 and 20 included.\n\nThank you for passing by, I hope you enjoy solving this kata.",
