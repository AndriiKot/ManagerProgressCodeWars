  "description": "A file's hash value is essentially a string of numbers and letters of fixed length, that functions as a cryptographic fingerprint for that file.\n\nFile hashes are commonly used in cyber security to identify different strains of malware, with a unique hash value corresponding to each malware file.\n\nYour junior analyst has just sent you a list of new malware hashes, but you know he has made mistakes entering them. Write a function to validate the array of hash values.\n\nIn this scenario, a valid hash value consists of five numbers and five lowercase letters in any order.\n\nReturn an array of valid hash values, and eliminate any duplicates.",
