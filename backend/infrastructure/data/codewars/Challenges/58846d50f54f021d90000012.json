  "description": "# Task\n We want to turn the given integer into a number that has only one non-zero digit using a tail rounding approach. This means that at each step we take the last non 0 digit of the number and round it to 0 or to 10. If it's less than 5 we round it to 0 if it's larger than or equal to 5 we round it to 10 (rounding to 10 means increasing the next significant digit by 1). The process stops immediately once there is only one non-zero digit left.\n\n# Example\n\n For value = 15, the output should be `20`\n\n For value = 1234, the output should be `1000`.\n\n 1234 -> 1230 -> 1200 -> 1000.\n\n For value = 1445, the output should be `2000`.\n\n 1445 -> 1450 -> 1500 -> 2000.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` integer `value`\n\n   A positive integer.\n\n   Constraints: 1 ≤ value ≤ 10<sup>8</sup>\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\n   The rounded number.",
