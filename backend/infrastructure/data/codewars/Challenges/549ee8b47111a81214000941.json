  "description": "Given two different positions on a chess board, find the least number of moves it would take a knight to get from one to the other.\nThe positions will be passed as two arguments in algebraic notation.\nFor example, `knight(\"a3\", \"b5\")` should return 1.\n\nThe knight is not allowed to move off the board.\nThe board is 8x8.\n\nFor information on knight moves, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_%28chess%29\n\nFor information on algebraic notation, see\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_%28chess%29\n\n(Warning: many of the tests were generated randomly. If any do not work, the test cases will return the input, output, and expected output; please post them.)",
