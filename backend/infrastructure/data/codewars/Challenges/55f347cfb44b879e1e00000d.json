  "description": "The numbers 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 have a common property. They have the same two prime factors that are 2 and 3.\n\nIf we see their prime factorization we will see it more clearly:\n\n```python\n6 = 2 * 3\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n18 = 2 * 3^2\n24 = 2^3 * 3\n36 = 2^2 * 3^2\n48 = 2^4 * 3\n```\n48 is the maximum of them below the value 50\n\nWe may see another cases, for numbers that have another two prime factors like: 5, 11, but below (or equal to) a maximum value of 1000\n\n```python\n55 = 5 * 11\n275 = 5^2 * 11\n605 = 5 * 11^2\n```\nIn this case 605 is the highest possible number below 1000.\n\n---\n\n## Task\n\nMake a function that receives two primes (p1, p2) and a maximum limit (nMax) as arguments (found numbers should be less than or equal to nMax).\n\nThe output should be a list or array of highest number found and its corresponding exponents of primes in order given.\n\nRepresenting the features for this function:\n\n```\n(p1, p2, nMax) -------> [max.number, k1, k2]\n\nmax.number = p1^k1 * p2^k2 <= nMax\n\np1 < p2 and k1 >= 1, k2 >= 1\n```\n\nLet's see the cases we have above:\n\n```python\n(p1=2, p2=3, nMax=50) ------> [48, 4, 1]\n\n(p1=5, p2=11, nMax=1000) ------> [605, 1, 2]\n```\nEnjoy it and happy coding!",
