  "description": "Doesn't everyone love a haiku? \n\nIf you don't know what that is, let me make your day :D\n\nA haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry, they normally have 3 lines with 5, 7 and 5 syllables respectively. For example:\n\n```\ncodewars training day\nregular expressions mean\nmany cups of tea\n```\n\nFeeling a little concerned that I'm about to ask you to write poetry? Fear not! You only have to translate the haiku from numbers to words, no need to start looking frantically for creative inspiration. Let me explain:\n\nI'm giving you:\n1. a function, `haikuWizard()`, which you have to complete.\n2. a big, predefined array (`word` in JavaScript & Crystal; `$words` in Ruby) with lots of words organised in subarrays! As you can see, each subarray has 10 members and they are all words with the same number of syllables. So `words[0]` contains words of 1 syllable, `words[1]` contains words of 2 syllables and so on.\n```javascript\n[\n  [\"like\", \"a\", \"tweet\", \"what\", \"for\", \"world\", \"whale\", \"one\", \"last\", \"sun\"],\n  [\"ocean\", \"beauty\", \"tweet\", \"monster\", \"yellow\", \"return\", \"despair\", \"flower\", \"return\", \"contrast\"],\n  [\"romantic\", \"curious\", \"banana\", \"jealousy\", \"tactlessly\", \"remorseful\", \"follower\", \"elephant\", \"however\", \"instagram\"],\n  [\"salmonella\", \"consequently\", \"irregular\", \"intelligence\", \"vegetable\", \"ordinary\", \"alternative\", \"watermelon\", \"controversial\", \"marijuana\"],\n  [\"lackadaisical\", \"serendipity\", \"colonoscopy\", \"dramatically\", \"parsimonius\", \"imagination\", \"electricity\", \"diabolical\", \"deforestation\", \"abomination\"],\n  [\"extraterrestrial\", \"onomatopoeia\", \"responsibility\", \"revolutionary\", \"generalisation\", \"enthusiastically\", \"biodiversity\", \"veterinarian\", \"characteristically\", \"indefatigable\"],\n  [\"oversimplification\", \"individuality\", \"decriminalisation\", \"compartmentalisation\", \"anaesthesiologist\", \"industrialisation\", \"buckminsterfullerene\", \"irresponsibility\", \"autobiographical\", \"utilitarianism\"]\n]\n```\n\nBack to our function: `haikuWizard()` takes an array as its input. This array has 3 subarrays - each subarray represents a line of the haiku. For example:\n\n`[[52], [17, 23, 39, 18], [33, 22]]`\n\nFor each number, the first digit tells you the number of syllables of the word, the second digit tells you which member of the relevant subarray it is.\n\nFor example:\n\n`52`: This means that the first line is made up of one word with 5 syllables, at index 2 in `words[4]`.\n\n`[17, 23, 39, 18]`: This means that the second line is made up of 4 words. The first has 1 syllable and is at index 7 in `words[0]`. The second has 2 syllables and is at index3 in `words[1]`. \nAnd so on... \n\nAll you have to do is complete the function `haikuWizard()` so that it translates the given array back into the beautiful haiku it came from :) \n\nYou should return a string, which on using console.log should display in the appropriate haiku format:\n\n```\nconsole.log(str);\n\nthere's a trumpet man\nwaltzing around the canals\nhe's getting dizzy\n```\n \nThe string itself will not have this format. \n\nTo summarise in case you don't feel like reading all that again:\n- ```haikuWizard()``` should turn ```arr``` into a haiku using the preloaded array ```words``` (`$words` in Ruby).\n- ```arr``` has 3 subarrays, each represents a line of the haiku.\n- the first digit of each number in ```arr``` represents the       number of syllables of the word, the second digit is its index in the   relevant subarray of ```words```.\n- the return string should display a beautiful haiku with the correct     structure.\n\nEnjoy!\n",
