  "description": "Take the following IPv4 address:  `128.32.10.1`. This address has 4 octets where each octet is a single byte (or 8 bits).\n\n* 1st octet 128 has the binary representation: 10000000\n* 2nd octet 32 has the binary representation: 00100000\n* 3rd octet 10 has the binary representation: 00001010\n* 4th octet 1 has the binary representation: 00000001\n\nSo `128.32.10.1` == `10000000.00100000.00001010.00000001`\n\nBecause the above IP address has 32 bits, we can represent it as the 32\nbit number: 2149583361.\n\nWrite a function `ip_to_int32(ip)` ( **JS**: `ipToInt32(ip)` ) that takes an IPv4 address and returns\na 32 bit number.\n\n\n### Example\n\n```text\n\"128.32.10.1\" => 2149583361\n```\n\n",
