  "description": "<a href=\"https://imgur.com/Z7HiIU4\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Z7HiIU4.jpg?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nCramer (1704 -1752), the swiss mathematician that created a method to solve systems of n linear equations with n variables.\n\nWe have a linear system of ```n Equations``` with ```n Variables``` like the following:\n\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/IK2keV7\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/IK2keV7.jpg?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nThe subindexed values ```a11```, ```a12```, .....```ann```,  are the coefficients of the different variables ```x1```, ```x2```, .....,``` xn```.\n\nWe define  ```Δ``` (delta), the determinant of the matrix of the coefficients as it follows:\n\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/zvVIYVB\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zvVIYVB.png?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\n\nYou may calculate the determinant also by the way is explained at the kata Matrix Determinant. See at: http://www.codewars.com/kata/matrix-determinant\n\nYou may learn also to calculate the determinant: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant\n\nThen, we define the vector, ```V```, with the independent terms ```b1```, ```b2```, ...., ```bn```:\n\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/m6m20id\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/m6m20id.png?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nWe will obtain the determinants for each variable replacing the vector V for a column in the position of the variable. ```Δx1```, the determinant for the variable ```x1```, ```Δx2```, the determinant for the variable ```x2``` and so on. It is as follows:\n\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/GaEIFJV\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GaEIFJV.png?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nSo the values of the variables are:\n\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/GMANk3Y\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GMANk3Y.png?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nWe should know that a linear equation system may be solvable, unsolvable or indeterminate as the following chart shows below:\n\n* If Δ ≠ 0 , the equation system is ***solvable***. Each \n  variable will have a value.\n  \n* If Δ = 0: the system will be ***Unsolvable*** if one of the variables Δx<sub>i</sub> is not 0 or the system will be ***Indeterminate or Unsolvable*** if all the values of Δx<sub>i</sub> are 0.\n\nFor that purpose we need a function ```cramer_solver()```, that will accept two arguments, ```matrix``` and ```vector```.\n\n\nThe function will output the array with the following results and order:\n```\n[Δ, Δx1, Δx2,........,Δxn]\n```\nBut if Δ = 0 and all the Δx<sub>i</sub> are 0, the code will output \"Indeterminate or Unsolvable\".\nIf Δ = 0 and at least only one Δx<sub>i</sub> ≠ 0, the code will output \"Unsolvable\".\n\nIf matrix is not square (equal amount of rows and columns) or the lengths of matrix and vector V are different, the code will \"Check entries\".\n\nLet's see how to solve some example using maths and how the results would be.\n\nWe want to solve the following system of equations:\n```\n4x - 6y - 3z = 12\n x +  y - 2z = 3\n4x -20y - 4z = 6\n```\nSo the function will receive the following matrix and vector:\n\n```python\nmatrix =[[4,-6, -3], [ 1 , 1, -2], [4, -20, -4]]\nvector = [12, 3, 6]\ncramer_solver(matrix, vector) == [-80, -330, -30, -60]\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar matrix =[[4,-6, -3], [ 1 , 1, -2], [4, -20, -4]];\nvar vector = [12, 3, 6];\ncramerSolver(matrix, vector) == [-80, -330, -30, -60];\n```\n\n```haskell\n>>> matrix = [[4,-6,-3],[1,1,-2],[4,-20,-4]]\n>>> vector = [12,3,6]\n>>> cramerSolver matrix vector\nRight [-80,-330,-30,-60]\n```\n\nAnother case:\n\n```\nx + y - 3z = -10\nx + y - 2z = 3\nx + y - 4z = -6\n```\nSo our solver will receive our matrix and vector:\n```python\nmatrix = [[1, 1, -3], [1, 1, -2], [1, 1, -4]]\nvector = [-10, 3, -6]\ncramer_solver(matrix, vector) == \"Unsolvable\"\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar matrix = [[1, 1, -3], [1, 1, -2], [1, 1, -4]];\nvar vector = [-10, 3, -6];\ncramerSolver(matrix, vector) == \"Unsolvable\"\n```\n\n```haskell\n>>> matrix = [[1,1,-3],[1,1,-2],[1,1,-4]]\n>>> vector = [-10,3,-6]\n>>> cramerSolver matrix vector\nLeft \"Unsolvable\"\n```\nLet's see one more:\n\n```\nx + y - 3z = 0\nx + y - 2z = 0\nx + y - 4z = 0\n```\n\nThe matrix and vector for this case:\n\n```python\nmatrix = [[1, 1, -3], [1, 1, -2], [1, 1, -4]]\nvector = [0, 0, 0]\ncramer_solver(matrix, vector) == \"Indeterminate or Unsolvable\"\n```\n```javascript\nvar matrix = [[1, 1, -3], [1, 1, -2], [1, 1, -4]];\nvar vector = [0, 0, 0];\ncramerSolver(matrix, vector) == \"Indeterminate or Unsolvable\"\n```\n```haskell\n>>> matrix = [[1, 1, -3], [1, 1, -2], [1, 1, -4]]\n>>> vector = [0, 0, 0]\n>>> cramerSolver matrix vector\nLeft \"Indeterminate or Unsolvable\"\n```\n\nIf we introduce a matrix that is not square, the function should detect it.\n```python\nmatrix = [[1, 1, -3, 4], [1, 1, -2, 3], [1, 1, -4, 2]]\nvector = [0, 0, 0]\ncramer_solver(matrix, vector) == \"Check entries\"\n```\n```javascript\nvar matrix = [[1, 1, -3, 4], [1, 1, -2, 3], [1, 1, -4, 2]];\nvar vector = [0, 0, 0];\ncramer_solver(matrix, vector) == \"Check entries\"\n```\n```haskell\n>>> matrix = [[1, 1, -3, 4], [1, 1, -2, 3], [1, 1, -4, 2]]\n>>> vector = [0, 0, 0]\n>>> cramerSolver matrix vector\nLeft \"Check entries\"\n```\n\nAlso cases where one (or more) row(s) has (have) different lengths.\n```python\nmatrix = [[1, 1, -3], [1, 1], [1, 1, -4]]\nvector = [-10, 3, -6]\ncramer_solver(matrix, vector) == \"Check entries\"\n```\n```javascript\nvar matrix = [[1, 1, -3], [1, 1], [1, 1, -4]];\nvar vector = [-10, 3, -6];\ncramerSolver(matrix, vector) == \"Check entries\"\n```\n```haskell\n>>> matrix = [[1, 1, -3], [1, 1], [1, 1, -4]]\n>>> vector = [-10, 3, -6]\n>>> cramerSolver matrix vector\nLeft \"Check entries\"\n```\n\nThe cases when the dimension of matrix is different than the length of vector should be detected, too.\n\n```python\nmatrix = [[1, 1, -3, 4], [1, 1, -2, 3], [1, 1, -4, 2], [6, 4, 2, 1]]\nvector = [1, 1, 1]\ncramer_solver(matrix, vector) == \"Check entries\"\n```\n```javascript\nvar matrix = [[1, 1, -3, 4], [1, 1, -2, 3], [1, 1, -4, 2], var [6, 4, 2, 1]];\nvector = [1, 1, 1];\ncramerSolver(matrix, vector) == \"Check entries\"\n```\n```haskell\n>>> matrix = [[1, 1, -3, 4], [1, 1, -2, 3], [1, 1, -4, 2], [6, 4, 2, 1]]\n>>> vector = [1, 1, 1]\n>>> cramerSolver matrix vector\nLeft \"Check entries\"\n```\n\nThe coefficients of the equation will be integer values for all the cases, so the array output should have only integers\n\nThe tests will challenge your code for linear equations systems up to 8 variables (and 8 equations obviously)\n\nEnjoy it!!\n",
