  "description": "Grinch wants to spoil Christmas for JavaScript programmers. For that, he devised a hellish plan: pollute their `Date` prototype so that Christmas never happens. He wants to change method `getDate` of `Date` so that it returns `26` for `Date` objects that represent 25th of December but works correctly for all other days of the year.\n \nHowever, Grinch does not know how to do that. Can you help him?",
