  "description": "_This Kata is intend to introduce one of the basic Python Golfing skill._\n\n# Task:\nIn this Golfing Kata, you are going to receive 2 positive integers `a` and `b`, you need to return the result of `math.ceil(a/b)`.\n\nBut `import math` is too long, your code has to be as short as possible. Can you avoid the `math.ceil`?\n\nHere are some limit:\n* Same as the `math.ceil`, your code has to return an `integer`, not `float`.\n\n* The length limit is 23, your code has to be equal or shorter than that.\n\n\n```\ninput --> output\nf(1, 1) --> 1\nf(2, 4) --> 1\nf(3, 3) --> 1\nf(4, 2) --> 2\nf(5, 3) --> 2\n```",
