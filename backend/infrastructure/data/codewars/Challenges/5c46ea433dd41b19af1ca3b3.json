  "description": "### Description\nAs hex values can include letters `A` through to `F`, certain English words can be spelled out, such as `CAFE`, `BEEF`, or `FACADE`.\nThis vocabulary can be extended by using numbers to represent other letters, such as `5EAF00D`, or `DEC0DE5`.\n\nGiven a string, your task is to return the decimal sum of all words in the string that can be interpreted as such hex values.\n\n\n### Example\n\nWorking with the string `\"BAG OF BEES\"`:\n```\n\"BAG\"  =  0, as it is not a valid hex value  \n\"OF\"   =  0F   =  15\n\"BEES\" =  BEE5 =  48869\n```\nSo the result is the sum of these: 48884 (0 + 15 + 48869)\n\n\n### Notes\n* Inputs are all uppercase and contain no punctuation\n* `0` can be substituted for `O`\n* `5` can be substituted for `S`\n",
