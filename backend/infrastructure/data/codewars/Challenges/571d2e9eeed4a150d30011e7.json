  "description": "You are the judge at a competitive eating competition and you need to choose a winner!\n\nThere are three foods at the competition and each type of food is worth a different amount of points.\nPoints are as follows:\n\n- Chickenwings: 5 points  \n\n- Hamburgers: 3 points   \n\n- Hotdogs: 2 points\n\nWrite a function that helps you create a scoreboard. \nIt takes as a parameter a list of objects representing the participants, for example:\n```\n[\n  {name: \"Habanero Hillary\", chickenwings: 5 , hamburgers: 17, hotdogs: 11},\n  {name: \"Big Bob\" , chickenwings: 20, hamburgers: 4, hotdogs: 11}\n]\n```\nIt should return \n\"name\" and \"score\" properties sorted by score; if scores are equals, sort alphabetically by name.\n```\n[\n  {name: \"Big Bob\", score: 134},\n  {name: \"Habanero Hillary\", score: 98}\n]\n```\nHappy judging!\n",
