  "description": "Lets play some Pong! \n\n![pong](http://gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pong-gif-3.gif)\n\nFor those who don't know what Pong is, it is a simple arcade game where two players can move their paddles to hit a ball towards the opponent's side of the screen, gaining a point for each opponent's miss. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).\n\n___\n\n# Task:\n\nYou must finish the `Pong` class. It has a constructor which accepts the `maximum score` a player can get throughout the game, and a method called `play`. This method determines whether the current player hit the ball or not, i.e. if the paddle is at the sufficient height to hit it back. There're 4 possible outcomes: player successfully hits the ball back, player misses the ball, player misses the ball **and his opponent reaches the maximum score winning the game**, either player tries to hit a ball despite the game being over. You can see the input and output description in detail below.\n\n### \"Play\" method input:\n\n* ball position - The Y coordinate of the ball\n* player position - The Y coordinate of the centre(!) of the current player's paddle\n\n### \"Play\" method output:\n\nOne of the following strings:\n\n* `\"Player X has hit the ball!\"` - If the ball \"hits\" the paddle\n* `\"Player X has missed the ball!\"` - If the ball is above/below the paddle\n* `\"Player X has won the game!\"` - If one of the players has reached the maximum score\n* `\"Game Over!\"` - If the game has ended when the `play` method is called\n\n### Important notes:\n\n* Players take turns hitting the ball, always starting the game with the Player 1.\n* The paddles are `7` pixels in height.\n* The ball is `1` pixel in height.\n\n___\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nlet game = new Pong(2); // Here we say that the score to win is 2\ngame.play(50, 53)  -> \"Player 1 has hit the ball!\";     // Player 1 hits the ball\ngame.play(100, 97) -> \"Player 2 has hit the ball!\";     // Player 2 hits it back\ngame.play(0, 4)    -> \"Player 1 has missed the ball!\";  // Player 1 misses so Player 2 gains a point\ngame.play(25, 25)  -> \"Player 2 has hit the ball!\";     // Player 2 hits the ball\ngame.play(75, 25)  -> \"Player 2 has won the game!\";     // Player 1 misses again. Having 2 points Player 2 wins, so we return the corresponding string\ngame.play(50, 50)  -> \"Game Over!\";                     // Another turn is made even though the game is already over\n```\n",
