  "description": "Let's build a matchmaking system that helps discover jobs for developers based on a number of factors.\n\nOne of the simplest, yet most important factors is compensation. As developers we know how much money we need to support our lifestyle, so we generally have a rough idea of the minimum salary we would be satisfied with. \n\nLet's give this a try. We'll create a function `match` (`job_matching` in Python) which takes a `candidate` and a `job`, which will return a Boolean indicating whether the job is a valid match for the candidate. \n\nA candidate will have a minimum salary, so it will look like this:\n\n```javascript\nlet candidate = {\n  minSalary: 120000\n}\n```\n```ruby\ncandidate = {\n  'min_salary': 120000\n}\n```\n```python\ncandidate = {\n  'min_salary': 120000\n}\n```\n```csharp\nCandidate candidate = \n  new Candidate(MinSalary: 120000);\n```\n\nA job will have a maximum salary, so it will look like this: \n\n```javascript \nlet job = {\n  maxSalary: 140000\n}\n```\n```ruby\njob = { \n  'max_salary': 140000\n}\n```\n```python\njob = {\n  'max_salary': 140000\n}\n```\n```csharp\nJob job = \n  new Job(MaxSalary: 140000);\n```\n\nIf either the candidate's minimum salary or the job's maximum salary is not present, throw an error. \n\nFor a valid match, the candidate's minimum salary must be less than or equal to the job's maximum salary. However, let's also include 10% wiggle room (deducted from the candidate's minimum salary) in case the candidate is a rockstar who enjoys programming on Codewars in their spare time. The company offering the job may be able to work something out. \n\n---\n\nContinue on with Kata:\n\n- [Job Matching #2][3]\n- [Job Matching #3][2]\n\n[3]:https://www.codewars.com/kata/56c2578be8b139bd5c001bd8\n[2]:https://www.codewars.com/kata/56c2a067585d9ac8280003c9",
