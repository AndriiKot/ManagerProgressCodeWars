  "description": "This is a hard version of <a href = 'http://www.codewars.com/kata/56a1c074f87bc2201200002e'>How many are smaller than me?</a>. If you have troubles solving this one, have a look at the easier kata first.\n\nWrite\n```javascript\nfunction smaller(arr)\n```\n```rust\nfn smaller(arr: &[i32]) -> Vec<usize>\n```\nthat given an array ```arr```, you have to return the amount of numbers that are smaller than ```arr[i]``` to the right.\n\nFor example:\n```javascript\nsmaller([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) === [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]\nsmaller([1, 2, 0]) === [1, 1, 0]\n```\n```rust\nsmaller(&[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == [4, 3, 2, 1, 0];\nsmaller(&[1, 2, 0]) == [1, 1, 0];\n```\n~~~if:python\n### Note\nYour solution will be tested against inputs with up to 120_000 elements\n~~~\n~~~if:rust\n### Note\nYour solution will be tested against inputs with up to 150_000 elements\n~~~\n~~~if:javascript\n### Note\nYour solution will be tested against inputs with up to 100_000 elements\n~~~",
