  "description": "Clients place orders to a stockbroker as strings. The order can be simple or multiple or empty.\n  \n  Type of a simple order: Quote/white-space/Quantity/white-space/Price/white-space/Status\n  \n  where Quote is formed of non-whitespace character, \n  Quantity is an int, \n  Price a double (with mandatory decimal point \".\" ), \n  Status is represented by the letter B (buy) or the letter S (sell).\n  \n#### Example: \n  \n  `\"GOOG 300 542.0 B\"`\n  \n  A multiple order is the concatenation of simple orders with a comma between each.\n  \n#### Example: \n  \n  `\"ZNGA 1300 2.66 B, CLH15.NYM 50 56.32 B, OWW 1000 11.623 B, OGG 20 580.1 B\"`\n  \n  or\n  \n  `\"ZNGA 1300 2.66 B,CLH15.NYM 50 56.32 B,OWW 1000 11.623 B,OGG 20 580.1 B\"`\n  \n  To ease the stockbroker your task is to produce a string of type\n  \n`\"Buy: b Sell: s\"`\n  where b and s are 'double' \n  formatted with no decimal, b representing the total price of bought stocks and s the total price of sold stocks.\n  \n#### Example: \n  \n  `\"Buy: 294990 Sell: 0\"`\n  \n  Unfortunately sometimes clients make mistakes. When you find mistakes in orders, you must pinpoint these badly formed orders\n  and produce a string of type:\n  \n  `\"Buy: b Sell: s; Badly formed nb: badly-formed 1st simple order ;badly-formed nth simple order ;\"`\n  \n  where nb is the number of badly formed simple orders, b representing the total price of bought stocks\n  with correct simple order and s the total price of sold stocks with correct simple order.\n  \n#### Examples: \n  \n  `\"Buy: 263 Sell: 11802; Badly formed 2: CLH16.NYM 50 56 S ;OWW 1000 11 S ;\"`\n  \n  `\"Buy: 100 Sell: 56041; Badly formed 1: ZNGA 1300 2.66 ;\"`\n  \n#### Notes:\n  - If the order is empty, Buy is 0 and Sell is 0 hence the return is: \"Buy: 0 Sell: 0\".\n  - Due to Codewars whitespace differences will not always show up in test results.\n  - With Golang (and maybe others) you can use a format with \"%.0f\" for \"Buy\" and \"Sell\".",
