  "description": "Your task is to write a function that doesn't have a fixed number of parameters. The function should count the arguments passed to it and return a string that specifies how many arguments were passed in, and states what they were.\n\nIf the function call is\n~~~~\nanArgument(\"pigs\", \"giraffes\", \"unicorns\");\n~~~~\n\nThe returned string should say\n~~~~\n'You gave me 3 arguments and they are \"pigs\", \"giraffes\" and \"unicorns\".'\n~~~~\n\nIf there is only one argument passed in, the string should say\n~~~~\n'You gave me 1 argument and it is \"pigs\".'\n~~~~\n\nIf there are two arguments, the string should say\n~~~~\n'You gave me 2 arguments and they are \"pigs\" and \"giraffes\".'\n~~~~\n\nIf there are no arguments, the string should say\n~~~~\n'You didn't give me any arguments.'\n~~~~\n\n### Punctuation and grammar notes\n- There are commas after each argument except the last and second-last, which are separated with 'and' \n- Arguments are presented in quotation marks \n- The singular: '1 argument' as opposed to multiples: '3 arguments'\n- Verb agreement: 'and it is' as opposed to 'and they are'\n",
