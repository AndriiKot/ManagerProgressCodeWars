  "description": "In this Kata, you will be given an array of integers and your task is to return the number of arithmetic progressions of size `3` that are possible from that list. In each progression, the differences between the elements must be the same.\n\n```\n[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9] ==> 5\n// [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 5], [1, 5, 9], [3, 5, 7], and [5, 7, 9]\n```\n\nAll array elements will be unique and sorted. More examples in test cases. \n\nGood luck!",
