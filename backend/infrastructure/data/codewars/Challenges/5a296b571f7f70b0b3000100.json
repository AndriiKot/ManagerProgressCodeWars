  "description": "In this Kata, you will be given a list of strings and your task will be to find the strings that have the same characters and return the sum of their positions as follows: \n\n```Haskell\nsolve([\"abc\",\"abbc\", \"ab\", \"xyz\", \"xy\", \"zzyx\"]) = [1,8]\n-- we see that the elements at indices 0 and 1 have the same characters, as do those at indices 3 and 5.\n-- we therefore return [1,8] because [0+1,3+5] = [1,8]. This result is sorted. \n-- ignore those that don't have at least one matching partner, such as \"ab\" and \"xy\".\n\nAnother example...\nsolve([\"wkskkkkkk\",\"fokoo\",\"wkskk\",\"uizzzz\",\"fokooff\",\"wkskkkk\",\"uizzzzzzz\"]),[5,7,9]);\n--The element at index 0 is similar to those at indices 2 and 5; so 0 + 2 + 5 = 7.\n--The element at index 1 is similar to that at index 4; so 1 + 4 = 5. \n--The element at index 3 is similar to that at index 6; so 3 + 6 = 9.\n--The result must be sorted. We get [5,7,9].\n```\nMore examples in the test cases. \n\nGood luck!",
