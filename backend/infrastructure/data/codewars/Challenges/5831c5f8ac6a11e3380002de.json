  "description": "> When no more interesting kata can be resolved, I just choose to create the new kata, to solve their own, to enjoy the process  --myjinxin2015 said\n\n## Description:\n\nComplete the function. Two arguments will be given:\n \n- `arr`: An array that contains some integers (positve,negative or zero).\n- `n`: A positive integer. 1 <= n <= arr.length.\n \nYour task is to find the minimum value of each `n` adjacent elements in `arr`. Returns by a new array. For example:\n\n```\narr = [1,2,3,10,-5], n = 2   ==>  [1,2,3,-5]\n# The min value of each 2 adjacent elements are:\n[(1,2)...]   --> 1\n[.(2,3)..]   --> 2\n[..(3,10).]  --> 3\n[...(10,-5)] --> -5\n```\n\n## Some Examples\n\n```\n[1,-2,3,-4,5,-6,7,8], 1  ==>  [1,-2,3,-4,5,-6,7,8]\n[1,-2,3,-4,5,-6,7,8], 2  ==>  [-2,-2,-4,-4,-6,-6,7]\n[1,-2,3,-4,5,-6,7,8], 3  ==>  [-2,-4,-4,-6,-6,-6]\n[1,-2,3,-4,5,-6,7,8], 4  ==>  [-4,-4,-6,-6,-6]\n```\n\nNote:\n - You can assume that all inputs are valid.\n - This is a simple version, please look forward to [the challenge version](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5831caa9fe3801522300000c) ;-)\n\n## A bit difficulty, A bit of fun, happy coding ;-)",
