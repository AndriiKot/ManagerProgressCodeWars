  "description": "Create a function that takes two times of day (hours, minutes, seconds) and returns the number of occurences of palindrome timestamps within that range, inclusive.\n\nA palindrome timestamp should be read the same hours : minutes : seconds as seconds : minutes : hours, keeping in mind the seconds and hours digits will reverse. For example, _20 : 11 : 02_ is a palindrome timestamp.\n\nEach part should be padded to 2 digits. `20:11:02` is a palindrome but `20:11:2` is not. Similarly, `11:1:11` is a palindrome while `11:01:11` is not.\n\n### Examples\n```\n(2, 12, 22, 4, 35, 10) ➞ 14\n\n(12, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13) ➞ 6\n\n(6, 33, 15, 9, 55, 10) ➞ 0\n```\n\n### Notes\n- Expect military time.\n- Include the given time parameters if they happen to be palendromes.\n- The parameter timestamps are chronological.",
