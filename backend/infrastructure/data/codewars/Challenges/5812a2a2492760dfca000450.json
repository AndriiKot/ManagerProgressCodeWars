  "description": "For this challenge you need to create a RECURSIVE Hierarchical query. You have a table `employees` of employees, you must order each employee by level. You must use a WITH statement and name it `employee_levels` after that has been defined you must select from it.\n\nA Level is in correlation what manager managers the employee. e.g. an employee with a manager_id of NULL is at level 1 and then direct employees with the employee at level 1 will be level 2.\n\n### employees table schema\n- id\n- first_name\n- last_name\n- manager_id (can be NULL)\n\n### resultant schema\n- level\n- id\n- first_name\n- last_name\n- manager_id (can be NULL)\n\n\n>NOTE: refer to the `Results: expected` table if you're stuck with how it should be displayed.",
