  "description": "The fusc function is defined recursively as follows:\n\n    1. fusc(0) = 0\n    2. fusc(1) = 1\n    3. fusc(2 * n) = fusc(n)\n    4. fusc(2 * n + 1) = fusc(n) + fusc(n + 1)\n    \n\nThe 4 rules above are sufficient to determine the value of `fusc` for any non-negative input `n`. For example, let's say you want to compute `fusc(10)`. \n\n1. `fusc(10) = fusc(5)`, by rule 3.\n2. `fusc(5) = fusc(2) + fusc(3)`, by rule 4.\n3. `fusc(2) = fusc(1)`, by rule 3.\n4. `fusc(1) = 1`, by rule 2.\n5. `fusc(3) = fusc(1) + fusc(2)` by rule 4.\n6. `fusc(1)` and `fusc(2)` have already been computed are both equal to `1`.\n\nPutting these results together `fusc(10) = fusc(5) = fusc(2) + fusc(3) = 1 + 2 = 3`\n\nYour job is to produce the code for the `fusc` function. In this kata, your function will be tested with small values of `n`, so you should not need to be concerned about stack overflow or timeouts. \n\nHint: Use recursion.\n\nWhen done, move on to [Part 2](http://www.codewars.com/kata/the-fusc-function-part-2).\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n### Encodings\n\npurity: `LetRec`  \nnumEncoding: `BinaryScott`  \n~~~",
