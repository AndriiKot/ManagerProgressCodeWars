  "description": "This challenge is an extension of the kata of Codewars: **Missing and Duplicate Number\"**, authored by the user **Uraza**. (You may search for it and complete it if you have not done it)\n\n\nIn this kata, we have an unsorted sequence of consecutive numbers from  ```a``` to ```b```, such that ```a < b``` always (remember ```a```, is the minimum, and ```b``` the maximum value).\n\nThey were introduced an unknown amount of duplicates in this sequence and we know that there is an only missing value such that all the duplicate values and the missing value are between ```a``` and ```b```, but never coincide with them.\n\nFind the missing number with the duplicate numbers (duplicates should be output in a sorted array).\n\nLet's see an example:\n\n```arr = [10,9,8,9,6,1,2,4,3,2,5,5,3]```\n\n```find_dups_miss([10,9,8,9,6,1,2,4,3,2,5,5,3]) == [7,[2,3,5,9]]```\n\nThe code should be fast to process long arrays (maximum length aprox. = 1.000.000).\nThe values for the randon tests:\n```\n500 <= a <= 50000\na + k <= b and 100 <= k <= 1000000\namount of duplicates variable, according to the length of the array\n```\n\n",
