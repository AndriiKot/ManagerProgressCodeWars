  "description": "Create a function `validate()` that takes a string email address and returns true if valid, false otherwise.\r\n\r\nA valid email is defined as:\r\n\r\n- Has an `@` symbol within\r\n- Has dots splitting up two or more strings at the right of the `@`.\r\n- Has contents to the left of the `@`. Only one part is needed. Multiply parts should be seperated with dots.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```ruby\r\nvalidate('joe@example.com') => true\r\nvalidate('joe.codewars@example.com') => true\r\nvalidate('joe') => false # does not contain @ symbol, does not contain two or more strings seperated by a dot after the @ symbol\r\nvalidate('@.') => false #nothing to the left of the @, does not adhere to rule 2 in the description\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a tool that may help: http://rubular.com/\r\n",
