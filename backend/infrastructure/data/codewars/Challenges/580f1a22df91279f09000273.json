  "description": "#### Task:\n\nYour job is to create a function, (`random_ints` in Ruby/Python/Crystal, and `randomInts` in JavaScript/CoffeeScript) that takes two parameters, `n` and `total`, that will randomly identify `n` non-negative integers that sum to the `total`. Note that [1, 2, 3, 4] and [2, 3, 4, 1] are considered to be 'the same array' when it comes to this kata.\n\n#### How the function will be called:\n\n```ruby\nrandom_ints(n, total) \n  # where n and total are non-negative integers, and the return type is an array of integers\n```\n```python\nrandom_ints(n, total) \n  # where n and total are non-negative integers, and the return type is an array of integers\n```\n```crystal\nrandom_ints(n, total) \n  # where n and total are non-negative integers, and the return type is an array of integers\n```\n```javascript\nrandomInts(n, total) \n  # where n and total are non-negative integers, and the return type is an array of integers\n```\n```coffeescript\nrandomInts(n, total) \n  # where n and total are none-negative integers, and the return type is an array of integers\n```\n\n#### Some example cases; however, do note that the integer inputs in the actual test suite are much larger in order to reduce the likelihood of two tests from being equal from chance:\n\n```ruby\nrandom_ints(3, 5) # all of the following are valid, but MUST NOT be repeated more than once when testing\n\t[1, 2, 2]\n\t[2, 3, 0]\n\t[1, 1, 3]\n\t…\nrandom_ints(2, 6) # all of the following are valid, but MUST NOT be repeated more than once when testing\n\t[2, 4]\n\t[0, 6]\n\t[1, 5]\n\t…\n```\n```crystal\nrandom_ints(3, 5) # all of the following are valid, but MUST NOT be repeated more than once when testing\n\t[1, 2, 2]\n\t[2, 3, 0]\n\t[1, 1, 3]\n\t…\nrandom_ints(2, 6) # all of the following are valid, but MUST NOT be repeated more than once when testing\n\t[2, 4]\n\t[0, 6]\n\t[1, 5]\n\t…\n```\n```python\nrandom_ints(3, 5) # all of the following are valid, but MUST NOT be repeated more than once when testing\n\t[1, 2, 2]\n\t[2, 3, 0]\n\t[1, 1, 3]\n\t…\nrandom_ints(2, 6) # all of the following are valid, but MUST NOT be repeated more than once when testing\n\t[2, 4]\n\t[0, 6]\n\t[1, 5]\n\t…\n```\n```javascript\nrandomInts(3, 5) # all of the following are valid, but MUST NOT be repeated more than once when testing\n\t[1, 2, 2]\n\t[2, 3, 0]\n\t[1, 1, 3]\n\t…\nrandomInts(2, 6) # all of the following are valid, but MUST NOT be repeated more than once when testing\n\t[2, 4]\n\t[0, 6]\n\t[1, 5]\n\t…\n```\n```coffeescript\nrandomInts(3, 5) # all of the following are valid, but MUST NOT be repeated more than once when testing\n\t[1, 2, 2]\n\t[2, 3, 0]\n\t[1, 1, 3]\n\t…\nrandomInts(2, 6) # all of the following are valid, but MUST NOT be repeated more than once when testing\n\t[2, 4]\n\t[0, 6]\n\t[1, 5]\n\t…\n```\n\nAlthough it may seem like overkill, the reason there are so many random tests is to ensure your outputs are 'random enough'; ie. if your code fails repeatedly, it is probably because not enough array elements are randomized fully.\n\nAs said earlier, due to the size of the inputs, it is highly unlikely (out of 10 submissions, it hasn't happened to me) that your code will fail due to pure chance/unluckiness. But nevertheless, it is still possible, so just to make sure, do run your code again in the event that it fails.\n\nAlso check out my other creations — [Adding Fractions](https://www.codewars.com/kata/adding-fractions),\n[Split Without Loss](https://www.codewars.com/kata/split-without-loss), [Implement String#transpose](https://www.codewars.com/kata/implement-string-number-transpose), [Implement Array#transpose!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/implement-array-number-transpose), [Arrays and Procs #1](https://www.codewars.com/kata/arrays-and-procs-number-1), and [Arrays and Procs #2](https://www.codewars.com/kata/arrays-and-procs-number-2)\n\nIf you notice any issues/bugs/missing test cases whatsoever (especially for JavaScript), do not hesitate to report an issue or suggestion.
