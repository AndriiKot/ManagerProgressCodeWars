  "description": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n\nLet’s assume that when you register a car you are assigned two numbers:\n\n1. Customer ID – number between `0` and `17558423` inclusively. It is assigned to car buyers in the following order: the first customer receives an ID of `0`, the second customer receives an ID of `1`, the third - `2`, and so on;\n\n2. A Number Plate – 6-character combination composed of the __series__ - three Latin lowercase letters from a to z; and the __serial number__ - three digits from 0 to 9. __Example:__ `aaa001, xyz123, tok469`;\n\nEach Number Plate is related to the given Customer ID. For example:\n\nCustomer ID of 0: `aaa001`\n\nCustomer ID of 21: `aaa022`\n\nCustomer ID of 169: `aaa170`\n\n<h2>Your Task</h2>\nWrite a function\n\n```if:python,ruby,crystal,rust,c,riscv\n`find_the_number_plate`\n```\n```if:javascript,java,d,coffeescript,typescript\n`findTheNumberPlate`\n```\n```if:go\n`FindTheNumberPlate`\n```\n\nwhich takes the Customer ID as an argument, calculates the Number Plate corresponding to this ID and returns it as a string;\n\n\n<h3>Rules</h3>\n\n1. The serial number changes first. For each 3-letter series it goes through 001 to 999, such as: \n`aaa001, aaa002, aaa003, ......, aaa998, aaa999`\n\n2.\tThe leftmost letter in the series switches alphabetically each time after the serial number has moved through 001 to 999 inclusively;\n```\naaa001...aaa999\n```\n_at this point the leftmost letter will switch alphabetically, while the serial number repeats the same cycle again;_\n```\nbaa001...baa999,\n...... ,\nzaa001...zaa999\n```\n\n3.\tThe middle letter switches alphabetically each time after the leftmost letter has moved through a to z and the __z**__ series has moved through 001 to 999.\n```\nzaa001...zaa999\n```\n_at this point the middle letter will switch alphabetically, while the leftmost letter and the serial number repeat the same cycle again;_\n```\naba001...aba999,\nbba001...bba999,\n......,\nzza001...zza999\n```\n4.\tThe rightmost letter switches alphabetically each time after the middle letter has moved through a to z and the __zz*__ series has moved through 001 to 999.\n```\nzza001...zza999\n```\n_at this point the rightmost letter will switch alphabetically, while the middle letter, the leftmost letter, and the serial number repeat the same cycle again;_\n```\naab001...aab999,\nbab001...bab999,\n......,\nzab001...zab999,\nabb001...abb999,\nbbb001...bbb999,\n......,\nzbb001...zbb999,\nacb001...acb999,\n......, \nzzz001...zzz999\n```\n\n<h3>Note</h3>\nIf the serial number has less than 3 digits, the missing places should be adjusted with zeroes.\n\n__i.e:__ `12` should equal `012`; `4` should equal `004`.\n\nOnce again, the customer ID starts with 0.\n<h3>Good luck!</h3>\n",
