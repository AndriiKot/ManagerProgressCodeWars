  "description": "*Oh no! I've lost my glasses, but paradoxically, I need glasses to find my glasses!*\n\nPlease help me out by showing me the **index** in the list which contains my glasses. They look like two capital Os, with at least one dash in between!\n\n- This means that both `O--O` and `O------------O` are valid glasses, but not `O----#--O` for example!\n- Search thoroughly, you might find my glasses in places such as `'dustO-Odust'`\n\n### Examples\n```python\n[\"phone\", \"O-O\", \"coins\", \"keys\"] ➞ 1\n\n[\"OO\", \"wallet\", \"O##O\", \"O----O\"] ➞ 3\n\n[\"O--#--O\", \"dustO---Odust\", \"more dust\"] ➞ 1\n```\n\n### Notes\n- All lists will include one valid pair of glasses because I swear I dropped them around here somewhere ...\n- All elements in the list are strings.\n",
