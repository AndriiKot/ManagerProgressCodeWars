  "description": "## Description\n\nPeter enjoys taking risks, and this time he has decided to take it up a notch!\n\nPeter asks his local barman to pour him **n** shots, after which Peter then puts laxatives in **x** of them. He then turns around and lets the barman shuffle the shots. Peter approaches the shots and drinks **a** of them one at a time. Just one shot is enough to give Peter a runny tummy. What is the probability that Peter doesn't need to run to the loo?\n\n## Task\n\nYou are given:\n\n**n** - The total number of shots.\n\n**x** - The number of laxative laden shots.\n\n**a** - The number of shots that peter drinks.\n\n\nreturn the probability that Peter won't have the trots after drinking. **n** will always be greater than **x**, and **a** will always be less than **n**.\n\n**You must return the probability rounded to two decimal places i.e. 0.05 or 0.81**",
