  "description": "# Task\n\nIn the field, two beggars A and B found some gold at the same time. They all wanted the gold, and they decided to use simple rules to distribute gold:\n```\nThey divided gold into n piles and be in line. \nThe amount of each pile and the order of piles all are randomly.\n\nThey took turns to take away a pile of gold from the \nfar left or the far right.\n\nThey always choose the bigger pile. That is to say, \nif the left is 1, the right is 2, then choose to take 2.\n\nIf the both sides are equal, take the left pile.\n```\n\nGiven an integer array `golds`, and assume that A always takes first. Please calculate the final amount of gold obtained by A and B. returns a two-element array `[amount of A, amount of B]`.\n\n# Example\n\nFor `golds = [4,2,9,5,2,7]`, the output should be `[14,15]`.\n```\nThe pile of most left is 4, \nThe pile of most right is 7, \nA choose the largest one -- > take 7\n\nThe pile of most left is 4, \nThe pile of most right is 2, \nB choose the largest one -- > take 4\n\nThe pile of most left is 2, \nThe pile of most left is 2, \nA choose the most left one -- > take 2\n\nThe pile of most left is 9, \nThe pile of most right is 2, \nB choose the largest one -- > take 9\n\nThe pile of most left is 5, \nThe pile of most left is 2, \nA choose the largest one -- > take 5\n\nTehn, only 1 pile left, \nB  -- > take 2\n\nA: 7 + 2 + 5 = 14\nB: 4 + 9 + 2 = 15\n```\n\nFor `golds = [10,1000,2,1]`, the output should be `[12,1001]`.\n```\nA take 10\nB take 1000\nA take 2\nB take 1\n\nA: 10 + 2 = 12\nB: 1000 + 1 = 1001\n```",
