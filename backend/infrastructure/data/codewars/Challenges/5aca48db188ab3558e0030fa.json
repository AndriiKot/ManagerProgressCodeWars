  "description": "You have to create a function which receives 3 number arguments: 2 operands `a` and `b`, and the result of an unknown operation performed on them.\n\nBased on those 3 values you have to return a string, that describes which operation was used to get the given result.\n\nThe possible return strings are:\n  `\"addition\"`,\n  `\"subtraction\"`,\n  `\"multiplication\"`,\n  `\"division\"`.\n\n## Examples:\n```javascript\n(a = 1, b = 2, result = 3)   --> 1 ? 2 = 3   --> \"addition\"\n(a = 5, b = 2, result = 2.5) --> 5 ? 2 = 2.5 --> \"division\"\n```\n\n## Notes\n* The `/` operator performs a plain division without rounding.\n* You can assume that there will always be a unique valid answer (no ambiguous cases like e.g. `1 ? 0 = 0` which could be either `-` or `+`, or `3 ? 1 = 3` which could be either `*` or `/`).\n* You can assume that there will be no division by `0`",
