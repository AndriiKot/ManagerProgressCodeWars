  "description": "You are standing on top of an amazing Himalayan mountain. The view is absolutely breathtaking! you want to take a picture on your phone, but... your memory is full again! ok, time to sort through your shuffled photos and make some space...\n\nGiven a gallery of photos, write a function to sort through your pictures.\nYou get a random hard disk drive full of pics, you must return an array with the 5 most recent ones PLUS the next one (same year and number following the one of the last).\n\nYou will always get at least a photo and all pics will be in the format `YYYY.imgN`\n\nExamples:\n```javascript\n[\"2016.img1\",\"2016.img2\",\"2015.img3\",\"2016.img4\",\"2013.img5\"] \n// Should return [\"2013.img5\",\"2015.img3\",\"2016.img1\",\"2016.img2\",\"2016.img4\",\"2016.img5\"]\n\n[\"2016.img1\"]\n// Should return [\"2016.img1\",\"2016.img2\"]\n```",
