  "description": "In an e-commerce company, an inventory of products is maintained. Each product has a certain quantity in stock. For reporting purposes, we need to display the data of the inventory where each product appears as many times as its quantity in stock.\n\nWe have a table called `products`. The `products` table has the following columns: `product_id` (an integer representing the unique ID of the product), `product_name` (a text string representing the name of the product), and `quantity_in_stock` (an integer representing the quantity of the product in stock).\n\nYou need to write a SQL query that generates a representation where each product appears as many times as its quantity in stock.\n\nHere is a simple example of what the `products` table might look like:\n\n```\n product_id | product_name | quantity_in_stock \n------------+--------------+-------------------\n          1 | product1     |                 4\n          2 | product2     |                 7\n```\nThe output of your query should look something like this:\n\n ```\n product_id  | product_name | quantity_in_stock \n------------+--------------+-------------------\n          2  | product2     |                 7\n          2  | product2     |                 7\n          2  | product2     |                 7\n          2  | product2     |                 7\n          2  | product2     |                 7\n          2  | product2     |                 7\n          2  | product2     |                 7\n          1  | product1     |                 4\n          1  | product1     |                 4\n          1  | product1     |                 4\n          1  | product1     |                 4          \n```\nThe output should be sorted by `product_id` in descending order.\n\nGLHF!",
