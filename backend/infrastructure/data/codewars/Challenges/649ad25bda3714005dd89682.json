  "description": "We have two tables: customers and loans.\n\n`customers` table:\n\n* `id` (integer): The primary key for the table.\n* `age` (integer): The age of the customer.\n\n`loans` table:\n\n* `id` (integer): The primary key for the table.\n* `customer_id` (integer): A foreign key referencing id in the customers table.\n* `loan_status` (string): The status of the loan, either 'paid' or 'unpaid'.\n* `loan_amount` (float): The amount of the loan.\n\nWrite a SQL query that returns a list of all customers who have IDs between 1 and 10.\nFor each customer, the query should return their ID (as customer_id) and their loan eligibility based on the following criteria:\n* If the customer is 18 to 65 years old (inclusive) and all their loans are paid or they don't have any loans, they should be considered eligible for a loan, and the query should return 'loan can be given'.\n* Otherwise, the query should return 'loan cannot be given'.\n\nThe results should be sorted by `customer_id` in descending order.\n\nGLHF!\n\n### Desired Output\n\nThe desired output should look like this:\n\n\n<table><!----><tr><th>customer_id</th><th>loan_eligibility</th></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>loan can be given</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>loan can be given</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>loan cannot be given</td></tr></table>\n...\n\n",
