  "description": "Given a standard english sentence passed in as a string, write a method that will return a sentence made up of the same words, but sorted by their first letter. However, the method of sorting has a twist to it:\n* All words that begin with a lower case letter should be at the beginning of the sorted sentence, and sorted in ascending order.\n* All words that begin with an upper case letter should come after that, and should be sorted in descending order.\n\nIf a word appears multiple times in the sentence, it should be returned multiple times in the sorted sentence. Any punctuation must be discarded.\n\n## Example\n\nFor example, given the input string `\"Land of the Old Thirteen! Massachusetts land! land of Vermont and Connecticut!\"`, your method should return `\"and land land of of the Vermont Thirteen Old Massachusetts Land Connecticut\"`. Lower case letters are sorted `a -> l -> l -> o -> o -> t` and upper case letters are sorted `V -> T -> O -> M -> L -> C`.",
