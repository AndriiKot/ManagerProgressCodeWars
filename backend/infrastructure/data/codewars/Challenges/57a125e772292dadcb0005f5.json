  "description": "A bar of a certain metal of length ```l```  is subjected to the application of different perpendicular forces (that may have up or down direction). The bar has a foothold at its midpoint ``` S``` . Each point of application of the force is at a distance that has an integer value, respect to the point ``` S```.\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/KJkXsbl\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/KJkXsbl.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nThe array that represents the system drawn above is : ```[2, -3, 1, 2, 'S', 3, -4, 0, 2]```\n\nWe are interested in a code that may predict if the bar will rotate with clockwise or anti clockwise spin, or the bar will remain steady.\n\nFrom Physics we will need the concept of Moment of a Force.\n\nAs all the forces are coplanar (the same plane) and the equation of ```the magnitude of the resultant Moment is```:\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/3fBS9nD\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3fBS9nD.png?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nApplying the equation to our situation, we will have:\n```\nM = 2*(-4) + (-3)*(-3) + 1*(-2) + 2*(-1) + 3*1 + (-4)*2 + 0*3 + 2*4 = -8 + 9 - 2 - 2 + 3 - 8 + 8 = 0\n```\nAs the result of the total moment for all the applied forces is ```0```, the bar will not rotate.\n\nSuposse that we change a bit the situation having a new force, of magnitud ```5``` that goes up, at the empty point, on the right of ```S```, at distance ```+3```.\n\nNow the resultant Moment is ```(-5) * 3 = -15```, that means that ```the bar will rotate anti clockwise.```\n\nThe function: ```rot_pred()``` (```rotPred()``` in Javascript) will an array of odd amount of terms and a string 'S' in the middle.\n\n```\npython\nrot_pred([2, -3, 1, 2, 'S', 3, -4, 0, 2]) == 'steady'\n\nrot_pred([2, -3, 1, 2, 'S', 3, -4, -5, 2]) == 'anti clockwise' (\n```\n\nIf the amount of elements on the right and on the left of ```S``` do not coincide the function will reject the entry.\n```\nrot_pred([2, -3, 1, 2 'S', 3, -4, -5]) == 'Not a Valid Entry'\n```\nEnjoy it!",
