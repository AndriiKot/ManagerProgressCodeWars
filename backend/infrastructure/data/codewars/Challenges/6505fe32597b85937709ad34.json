  "description": "# Intro\nSorry for the duplication https://www.codewars.com/kata/60f9f0145a54f500107ae29b.\nHowever this is a harder version since the maximum of degree has been incresed.\n\nHi, I don't know if you play the following math game before:\n\nFill in the blanks: 1, 4, 9, ___, 25, 36, ___,...\n\nThis game has given a polynomial sequence and find the missing/next term.\nI changed a bit of rules of this game and it becomes a kata :D\n\n# Tasks\nGiven a polynomial sequence array and a positive integer n. Find the nth term of the sequence. You can understand as let f(x) be the general formula of the polynomial sequence and find the value of f(n).\n\n# Examples\n```python\nnth_term([1, 3, 5], 5) # Output: 9, because the 5th term of [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] is 9 after expanding the sequence.\nnth_term([-1, 5, 23, 59], 8) # Output: 503, because the general formula is f(x) = x**3 - x - 1, f(8) is 503.\n```\n\n# Details and Ranges\n- The given sequence must be a polynomial sequence.\n- For all terms of the polynomial sequence must be integer.\n- There are no invalid inputs.\n- The range of the degrees of general formula is `0` to `100`.\n- The range of the integer n is `1` to `1000`.\n- The range of the coefficients of general formula is `-10**100` to `10*100`.",
