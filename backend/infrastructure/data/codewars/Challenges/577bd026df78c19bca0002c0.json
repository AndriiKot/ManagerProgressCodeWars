  "description": "Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.\n\nWhen documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.\n\nYour task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:\n\n* `S`  is misinterpreted as `5`\n* `O` is misinterpreted as `0`\n* `I` is misinterpreted as `1`\n\nThe test cases contain numbers only by mistake.",
