  "description": "A prison can be represented as an array of cells, where each cell contains exactly one prisoner. A 'True' represents an unlocked cell, and 'False' represents a locked cell.\n\n```\n[True, True, False, False, False, True, False]\n```\n\nStarting inside the leftmost cell, you are tasked with determining how many prisoners you can set free, with a catch. You are the prisoner in the first cell. If the first cell is locked (denoted as 'False'), you cannot free anyone. Each time you free a prisoner, the locked cells become unlocked, and the unlocked cells become locked again.\n\nSo, if we use the example above:\n\n```\n[True, True, False, False, False, True, False]\n// You free the prisoner in the 1st cell.\n\n[False, False, True, True, True, False, True] \n// You free the prisoner in the 3rd cell (the 2nd one is locked).\n\n[True, True, False, False, False, True, False]\n// You free the prisoner in the 6th cell (the 3rd, 4th, and 5th cells are locked).\n\n[False, False, True, True, True, False, True]\n// You free the prisoner in the 7th cell - and you are done!\n```\n\nHere, we have set free '4' prisoners in total.\n\nCreate a function that, given this unique prison arrangement, returns the number of freed prisoners.\n\n### Examples\n```\n([True, True, False, False, False, True, False]) ➞ 4\n\n([True, True, True]) ➞ 1\n\n([False, False, False]) ➞ 0\n\n([False, True, True, True]) ➞ 0\n```\n\n### Notes\n- **You are the prisoner in the first cell. You must be freed to free anyone else.**\n- You must free a prisoner to change the locks. So in the second example where the input is `[True, True, True]`, after you release the first prisoner, the locks change to `[False, False, False]`. Since all cells are locked, you can release no more prisoners.\n- You always start with the leftmost element in the array (the first prison cell). If all the prison cells to your right are 'False', you cannot free any more prisoners.",
