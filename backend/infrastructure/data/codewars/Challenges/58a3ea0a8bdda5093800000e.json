  "description": "# Task\n You are given an integer `n`(in string format). Find the smallest integer `m` such that both `m` and its reversed version (a number that is obtained by reversing the order of its digits) are not less than `n`.\n\n Note: After reversing all leading zeros are omitted.\n\n# Examples\n\n For `n = \"5314\"`, the result should be `\"5316\". \n \n Because both numbers `5316` and `6135` are not less than 5314. \n \n The result is not `5315` because `5135`(5315 reversed) < `5314`.\n\n For `n = \"23456\"`, the result is also `\"23456\"`.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` string `n`\n\n  string representation of a positive integer n. `0 < n < 10^100`\n\n\n - `[output]` a string\n\n  string representation of an integer `m`",
