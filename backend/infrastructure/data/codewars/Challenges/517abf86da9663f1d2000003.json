  "description": "Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into [camel casing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case). The first word within the output should be capitalized **only** if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). The next words should be always capitalized.\n\n### Examples\n\n`\"the-stealth-warrior\"` gets converted to `\"theStealthWarrior\"` \n \n`\"The_Stealth_Warrior\"` gets converted to `\"TheStealthWarrior\"`\n\n`\"The_Stealth-Warrior\"` gets converted to `\"TheStealthWarrior\"`\n",
