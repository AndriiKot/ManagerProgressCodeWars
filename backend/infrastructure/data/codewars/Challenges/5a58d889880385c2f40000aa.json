  "description": "A number is called **Automorphic number** if and only if its square ends in the same digits as the number itself. For example, `25` is an automorphic number because its square (`625`) ends with `25`.\n\n### Task\nGiven a positive number, determine if it is Automorphic or not. If it is, return `\"Automorphic\"`, otherwise return `\"Not!!\"`\n\n### Examples \n\n- `25` is an automorphic number, because `$ 25^2 = 625 $` ends with `25`, so return `\"Automorphic\"`.\n- `13` is not an automorphic number, because `$ 13^2 = 169 $` does not end with `13`, so return `\"Not!!\"`.\n- `76` is an automorphic number, because `$ 76^2 = 5776 $` ends with `76`, so return `\"Automorphic\"`.\n- `225` is not an automorphic number, because `$ 225^2 = 50625 $` does not end with `225`, so return `\"Not!!\"`.\n- `625` is an automorphic number, because `$ 625^2 = 390625 $` ends with `625`, so return `\"Automorphic\"`.\n- `1` is an automorphic number, because `$ 1^2 = 1 $` ends with `1`, so return `\"Automorphic\"`.\n- `6` is an automorphic number, because `$ 6^2 = 36 $` ends with `6`, so return `\"Automorphic\"`.\n___\n\n[Playing with Numbers Series](https://www.codewars.com/collections/playing-with-numbers)\n\n[Playing With Lists/Arrays Series](https://www.codewars.com/collections/playing-with-lists-slash-arrays)\n\n[For More Enjoyable Katas](http://www.codewars.com/users/MrZizoScream/authored)",
