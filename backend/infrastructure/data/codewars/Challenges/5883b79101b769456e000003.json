  "description": "#Split all even numbers to odd ones in different ways\n\nYour task is to split all even numbers from an array to odd ones. So your method has to return a new array with only odd numbers.\n\nFor \"splitting\" the numbers there are four ways.\n\n```\n0 -> Split into two odd numbers, that are closest to each other.\n     (e.g.: 8 -> 3,5)\n1 -> Split into two odd numbers, that are most far from each other.\n     (e.g.: 8 -> 1,7)\n2 -> All new odd numbers from the splitting should be equal and the maximum possible number.\n     (e.g.: 8 -> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\n3 -> Split into 1s.\n     (e.g.: 8 -> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\nThe new numbers (from the splitting) have always to be in ascending order.\nSo in the array every even number is replaced by the new odd numbers from the splitting.\n```\n\nYour method will get as parameters the input-array and the number of the way for splitting the even numbers.\n\nSome Examples\n```\n[1,10,1,3],0 -> [1,5,5,1,3]\n[1,10,1,3],1 -> [1,1,9,1,3]\n[1,10,1,3],2 -> [1,5,5,1,3]\n[1,10,1,3],3 -> [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3]\n\n[1,1,3,8],0 -> [1,1,3,3,5]\n[1,1,3,8],1 -> [1,1,3,1,7]\n[1,1,3,8],2 -> [1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n[1,1,3,8],3 -> [1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n```\n\nThe array will never be null and will always contain only integer numbers > 0. Also your result-array must contain only integer numbers > 0.\nThe way-parameter will always be between inclusive 0 and inclusive 3 (0,1,2,3).\n\nYou must not change the input-array!\n\n<br><br><br>\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) \n\nI have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!",
