  "description": "Looking at consecutive powers of `2`, starting with `2^1`:\n\n`2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, ...`\n\nNote that out of all the digits `0-9`, the last one ever to appear is `7`. It only shows up for the first time in the number `32768 (= 2^15)`.\n\nSo let us define LAST DIGIT TO APPEAR as the last digit to be written down when writing down all the powers of `n`, starting with `n^1`.\n\n\n## Your task\n\nYou'll be given a positive integer ```1 =< n <= 10000```, and must return the last digit to appear, as an integer.\n\nIf for any reason there are digits which never appear in the sequence of powers, return `None`/`nil`.\n\nPlease note: The Last digit to appear can be in the same number as the penultimate one. For example for `n = 8`, the last digit to appear is `7`, although `3` appears slightly before it, in the same number:\n`8, 64, 512, 4096, 32768, ...`",
