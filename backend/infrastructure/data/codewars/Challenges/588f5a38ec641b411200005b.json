  "description": "Write a function that receives two strings as parameter. This strings are in the following format of date: `YYYY/MM/DD`.\nYour job is: Take the `years` and calculate the difference between them.\n\n### Examples:\n```\n'1997/10/10' and '2015/10/10' -> 2015 - 1997 = returns 18 \n'2015/10/10' and '1997/10/10' -> 2015 - 1997 = returns 18\n```\nAt this level, you don't need validate months and days to calculate the difference.",
