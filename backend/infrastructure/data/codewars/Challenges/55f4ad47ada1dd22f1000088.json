  "description": "Many items that are available for sale have a barcode somewhere on them - this allows them to be scanned at a checkout.\n\nYour task is to create an algorithm to convert a series of ones and zeroes from the scanner into an Universal Product Code (UPC). You can learn more about UPC from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code). We will be using the UPC-A formatting.\n\n\n## Specifications\n\nEach barcode follows the pattern: `SLLLLLLMRRRRRRE`\n\n`S`, `M` and `E` are guard bars (start, middle, end). These are constants.\n\n`L` and `R` are digits. They are 7 modules wide and are variables. They can be of 1 of 10 patterns.\n\nEach item is described using the pattern below. The number indicates how many modules wide, the letter is the colour of the bar: `W` for white and `B` for black.\n\nThe guard bars:\n\n```\nS: 1B1W1B\nM: 1W1B1W1B1W\nE: 1B1W1B\n```\nThese are the `L` digits: \n```\n0: 3W2B1W1B\n1: 2W2B2W1B\n2: 2W1B2W2B\n3: 1W4B1W1B\n4: 1W1B3W2B\n5: 1W2B3W1B\t\n6: 1W1B1W4B\n7: 1W3B1W2B\n8: 1W2B1W3B\n9: 3W1B1W2B\n```\n\nYou will be provided with a preloaded dictionary `DIGITS` which contains the above information (`L` digits and guard bar patterns).\n\n`R` digits are the inverse of `L` digits, e.g.:\n```\n0: 3B2W1B1W\n```\n\n## Your task\nYour function will receive a string consisting of ones (black) and zeroes (white), and should return the UPC as a string. Each one or zero will correspond to one *module* of width. **Only valid barcodes will be supplied**, and they will always be presented from left to right. They will start with the first black line of the guard bars.\n\n## Example\n```python\n\"10101110110110111000101100010110101111011011101010111001011100101110010111001011011001000010101\"\n=> \"789968000023\"\n\nbecause:\n\"101 0111011 0110111 0001011 0001011 0101111 0110111 01010 1110010 1110010 1110010 1110010 1101100 1000010 101\"\n\" S     7       8       9       9       6       8      M      0       0       0       0       2       3     E \"\n```",
