  "description": "The Math.min function has stopped working, so we have to use our own function.  We are off to a good start, but this function doesn't seem to handle everything properly. Add in the proper checks to return `NaN` for anything that isn't an actual number, except treat `null` like `0`.\n\nNote: This min function need not handle more than two arguments.\n\n\n    function min(a, b){\n      return (a<b)?a:b;\n    }",
