  "description": "**Principal Diagonal** -- The principal diagonal in a matrix identifies those elements of the matrix running from North-West to South-East.\n\n**Secondary Diagonal** -- the secondary diagonal of a matrix identifies those elements of the matrix running from North-East to South-West.\n\nFor example:\n```\nmatrix:             [1, 2, 3]\n                    [4, 5, 6]\n                    [7, 8, 9]\n\nprincipal diagonal: [1, 5, 9]\nsecondary diagonal: [3, 5, 7]\n\n```\n\n## Task\nYour task is to find which diagonal is \"larger\": which diagonal has a bigger sum of their elements.\n\n* If the principal diagonal is larger, return `\"Principal Diagonal win!\"`\n* If the secondary diagonal is larger, return `\"Secondary Diagonal win!\"`\n* If they are equal, return `\"Draw!\"`\n\n**Note:** You will always receive matrices of the same dimension.\n",
