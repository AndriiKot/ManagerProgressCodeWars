  "description": "Pig latin is created by taking all the consonants before the first vowel (for the purposes of this kata, a \"vowel\" is any letter from the set `a, e, i, o, u`) of a word and moving them to the back of the word followed by the letters \"ay\".\n```javascript\n\"hello\" => \"ellohay\"\n\"creating\" => \"eatingcray\"\n```\n  \nIf the first letter of the word is a vowel, the string is left the same and the letters \"way\" are appended to the end.\n```javascript\n\"algorithm\" => \"algorithmway\"\n```\n\nIf a word has no vowels, just append \"ay\" to the end of it.\n```javascript\n\"gym\" => \"gymay\"\n```\n\nThis problem is different from other variations in that it expects casing to remain the same so:\n```javascript\n\"Hello World\" => \"Ellohay Orldway\"\n```\n\nas well as punctuation (for the purposes of this kata, \"punctuation\" includes `,`, `.`, `!`, `?`, `:`, `;`).\n```javascript\n\"Pizza? Yes please!\" => \"Izzapay? Esyay easeplay!\"\n```\n\nNumbers should be left as-is.\n```javascript\n\"0875568\" => \"0875568\"\n```\n\nYour job is to take a string and translate it to Pig Latin. The string will never be undefined but may contain both numbers and letters. A word will __never__ be a combination of numbers and letters. Also, there will __never__ be punctuation at the beginning of a word and the __only__ capital letter in a word will be the first letter meaning there are __zero__ all capitalized words.\n",
