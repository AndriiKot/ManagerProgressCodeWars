  "description": "Oh no! Aliens have invaded Earth. They choose you to solve its problem or else they will enslave all of humanity.\nThe aliens are running out of water and need you to find water sources on their home planet or else they will steal ours. \n\nThey give you an array which describes the surface on their home planet, where * denotes water and anything else is not. In this array, if multiple asterisks '*' are grouped together, this counts as one water source. You must return an array containing the locations (indexes) of all water sources. You also must account for when there is no water source '*'.\n\nFor a water source with multiple asterisks, return the index of the first asterisk in the group.\n\n\nEg. \n\n    input of: ['#', '*', '*', ')', '/', '*'] --> should return: [1,5]\n\n    input of: ['(', '^', '$', '#', '#'] --> should return: []\n    ",
