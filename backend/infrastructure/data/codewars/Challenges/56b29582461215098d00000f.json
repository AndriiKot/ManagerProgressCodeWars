  "description": "### Issue\n\nLooks like some hoodlum plumber and his brother has been running around and damaging your stages again.\n\nThe `pipes` connecting your level's stages together need to be fixed before you receive any more complaints.\n\nThe `pipes` are correct when each `pipe` after the first is `1` more than the previous one.\n\n### Task\n\nGiven a list of unique `numbers` sorted in ascending order, return a new list so that the values increment by 1 for each index from the minimum value up to the maximum value (both included).\n\n### Example\n\n`Input:  1,3,5,6,7,8`\n`Output: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8`\n",
