  "description": "# Fun with ES6 Classes #3 - Cuboids, Cubes and Getters\n\n## Task\n\nDefine the following classes.\n\n### I. Cuboid\n\nThe object ```constructor``` for the ```class Cuboid``` should receive exactly three arguments in the following order: ```length, width, height``` and store these three values in ```this.length```, ```this.width``` and ```this.height``` respectively.\n\nThe ```class Cuboid``` should then have a **getter** ```surfaceArea``` which returns the surface area of the cuboid and a getter ```volume``` which returns the volume of the cuboid.\n\n### II. Cube\n\n```class Cube``` is a subclass of ```class Cuboid```.  The ```constructor``` function of ```Cube``` should receive one argument only, its ```length```, and use that value passed in to set ```this.length```, ```this.width``` and ```this.height```.\n\n*Hint: Make a call to ```super```, passing in the correct arguments, to make life easier ;)*\n\n## Related Articles\n\nListed below are a few articles of interest that may help you complete this Kata:\n\n1.
