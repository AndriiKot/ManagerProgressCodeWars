  "description": "## Mighty Heroes \n\nAlyosha Popovich (Russian folk hero) stroke his sharp sword and cut the head of Zmey Gorynych (big Serpent with several heads)! He looked - and lo! - in its place immediately new heads appeared, exactly `n`. He stroke again, and where the second head was, `2*n` heads appeared! The third time it was `2*3*n` new heads, and after fourth swing it was `2*3*4*n` heads, and so forth. And thus Alyosha decided to call it a day, and instead called a fellow Mage for help. While the Mage agreed, he needs to know the exact number of heads that Zmey Gorynych now has.\n\n## The task\n\nGiven the initial number of heads, the heads-count multiplier, and the number of sword-swings, calculate how many heads Zmey Gorynych has in the end.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\ninitial = 2\nmultiplier = 1\nswings = 1\n\nresult:\n  1 head appearead after the swing: 2 - 1 + 1 = 2\n  Zmey has 2 heads in the end\n```\n\n```\ninitial = 5\nmultiplier = 10\nswings = 3\n\nresult:\n  10 heads appearead after the first swing: 5 - 1 + 10 = 14\n  20 heads appearead after the second swing: 14 - 1 + 2 * 10 = 33\n  60 heads appearead after the third swing: 33 - 1 + 2 * 3 * 10 = 92\n  Zmey has 92 heads in the end\n```",
