For that result we have only the combination of ```6``` and ```5```. So we will have two events: {5, 6} and {6, 5}\n\nSo the probability for that result will be:\n```\nP(11, 2) = 2/(6*6) = 1/18    (The two is because we have 2 dice)\n```\nNow, we want to calculate the probability of having the sum equals to ```8```. The combinations for that result will be the following:\n```{4,4}, {3,5}, {5,3}, {2,6}, {6,2}``` with a total of five combinations.\n```\nP(8, 2) = 5/36 \n```\nThings may be more complicated if we have more dices and sum values higher.\n\nWe want to know the probability of having the sum equals to ```8``` but having ```3``` dice.\n\nNow the combinations and corresponding events are:\n```\n{2,3,3}, {3,2,3}, {3,3,2}\n{2,2,4}, {2,4,2}, {4,2,2}\n{1,3,4}, {1,4,3}, {3,1,4}, {4,1,3}, {3,4,1}, {4,3,1}\n{1,2,5}, {1,5,2}, {2,1,5}, {5,1,2}, {2,5,1}, {5,2,1}\n{1,1,6}, {1,6,1}, {6,1,1}\n\nA total amount of 21 different combinations\n\nSo the probability is:\nP(8, 3) = 21/(6*6*6) = 0.09722222222222222\n```\n\nSummarizing the cases we have seen with a function that receives the two arguments\n```python\nrolldice_sum_prob(11, 2) == 0.0555555555 # or 1/18\n\nrolldice_sum_prob(8, 2) ==  0.13888888889# or 5/36\n\nrolldice_sum_prob(8, 3) == 0.0972222222222  # or 7/72\n```\n```haskell\n>>> rolldiceSumProb 11 2\n0.0555555555     -- or 1/18\n>>> rolldiceSumProb 8 2\n0.13888888889    -- or 5/36\n>>> rolldiceSumProb 8 3\n0.0972222222222  -- or 7/72\n```\nAnd think why we have this result:\n```python\nrolldice_sum_prob(22, 3) == 0\n```\n```haskell\n>>> rolldiceSumProb 22 3\n0\n```\n\nCreate the function `rolldice_sum_prob`/`rolldiceSumProb` for this calculation.\n\n\nHave a nice time!\n\n(You do not have to round the results)\n\n\n",
