  "description": "# Background\n\nA spider web is defined by\n\n* \"rings\" numbered out from the centre as `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`\n\n\n* \"radials\" labelled clock-wise from the top as `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G`, `H`\n\nHere is a picture to help explain:\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tGeWQVq.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" />\n\n\n# Web Coordinates\n\nAs you can see, each point where the rings and the radials intersect can be described by a \"web coordinate\".\n\nSo in this example the spider is at `H3` and the fly is at `E2`\n\n\n# Kata Task\n\nOur friendly jumping spider is resting and minding his own spidery business at web-coordinate `spider`.\n\nAn inattentive fly bumbles into the web at web-coordinate `fly` and gets itself stuck.\n\nYour task is to calculate and return <span style='color:orange; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.1em;'>**the \n distance**</span> the spider must jump to get to the fly.\n\n# Example\n\nThe solution to the scenario described by the picture is ``4.63522``\n\n# Notes\n\n* The centre of the web will always be referred to as `A0` \n* The rings intersect the radials at **evenly** spaced distances of **1 unit**\n\n\n____\n\n<div style= 'color:red'>\nGood Luck!<br/>DM\n</div>\n\n",
