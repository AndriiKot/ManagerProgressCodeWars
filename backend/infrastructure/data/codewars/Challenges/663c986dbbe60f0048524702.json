  "description": "As ABC Kata Solutions celebrates its anniversary, this SQL challenge aims to shed light on the company’s staffing trends, demonstrating resilience and adaptability in the face of the tech industry’s evolving needs. Over the years, ABC Kata Solutions has grown significantly, navigating both expansions and strategic adjustments to align with global demands. Notably, in 2019, ABC Kata Solutions made a tough but necessary decision to optimize its operations, which involved realigning its workforce. This decision, while difficult, was pivotal to maintaining ABC Kata Solutions'commitment to excellence and sustainability, ultimately leading to a more focused and efficient operation.\n\nYou need to write an SQL query to analyze employee hiring and attrition trends from the year of inception in 2014 up to the year of 2023. The objective is to provide a clear picture of how many employees joined and left the company each year, reflecting the dynamic changes in the workforce.\n\nYou are working with an `employees` table from ABC Kata Solutions' database. Below is the schema for the employees table:\n\n* `id` (int): A unique identifier for each employee.\n* `joined_date` (date): The date on which the employee joined ABC Kata Solutions.\n* `left_date` (date, nullable): The date on which the employee left ABC Kata Solutions, if applicable\n\nWrite an SQL query that identifies how many employees joined and left ABC Kata Solutions each year, from 2014 through 2023. The query should produce a list of years from 2014 to 2023 along with two counts for each year. The result set should have 3 colums:\n\n1) `year`: The year being reported.\n2) `joined_quantity`: The number of employees who joined ABC Kata Solutions. Refers to the total number of employees whose `joined_date` falls within the specific calendar year.\n3) `left_quantity`: The number of employees who left ABC Kata Solutions. Refers to the total number of employees whose `left_date` falls within the specific calendar year, indicating they have left the company. \n\nEnsure each year from 2014 to 2023 is included in the final report, regardless of whether there were any hires or departures in those years. The results should be sorted in ascending order by the year.\n\nFor this sample data:\n\n```\n| id | joined_date | left_date  |\n+----+-------------+------------+\n| 1  | 2014-03-15  | 2018-05-20 |\n| 2  | 2014-06-10  | <null>     |\n| 3  | 2015-07-21  | 2019-12-30 |\n| 4  | 2017-01-05  | <null>     |\n| 5  | 2018-11-11  | 2020-03-15 |\n| 6  | 2019-12-25  | <null>     |\n| 7  | 2020-07-20  | <null>     |\n| 8  | 2021-05-27  | 2023-01-10 |\n```\n\nthe desired output is the following:\n\n```\n| year        | joined_quantity | left_quantity |\n+-------------+-----------------+---------------+\n| 2014        | 2               | 0             |\n| 2015        | 1               | 0             |\n| 2016        | 0               | 0             |\n| 2017        | 1               | 0             |\n| 2018        | 1               | 1             |\n| 2019        | 1               | 1             |\n| 2020        | 1               | 1             |\n| 2021        | 1               | 0             |\n| 2022        | 0               | 0             |\n| 2023        | 0               | 1             |\n```\n\nGLHF!",
