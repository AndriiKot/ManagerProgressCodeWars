  "description": "Let's say take 2 strings, A and B, and define the similarity of the strings to be the length of the longest prefix common to both strings. For example, the similarity of strings `abc` and `abd` is 2, while the similarity of strings `aaa` and `aaab` is 3.\n\nwrite a function that calculates the sum of similarities of a string S with each of it's **suffixes**.\n\n### Examples (input -> output):\n```\n'ababaa' -> 11\n'abc' -> 3\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the first case, the suffixes of the string are `ababaa`, `babaa`, `abaa`, `baa`, `aa` and `a`. The similarities of each of these strings with the string `ababaa` are 6,0,3,0,1,1 respectively. Thus the answer is 6 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 11.\n\nFor the second case, the answer is simply 3 + 0 + 0 = 3.\n\nNote : Each string will have at least one character - no need to check for empty strings :)",
