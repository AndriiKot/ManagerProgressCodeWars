  "description": "You have been provided with a PostgreSQL table named `users`. This table includes a `jsonb` column, `info`, which holds JSON data. Here is a simplified schema of the table:\n\n* `id`: primary key, integer.\n* `info`: JSON column which includes:\n   *  `name`: a string (user's name).\n   *  `pets`: an array of JSON objects (each object represents a pet and has a `name` field and `type` field).\n   \nYour task is to construct a SQL query that will return a list of users and their pet names, but only for users who have at least one pet whose name starts with the letter 'M'. The query should return the following columns:\n* `id` - the users id\n* `user_name` - the user's name\n* `pet_names` -  the names of the pets whose names start with 'M' as a comma-separated list in the order that they appeared in the array.  \n\nResult should be ordered by id in asc order.\n\nGood luck!\n\n### Desired Output\n\nThe desired output should look like this:\n```\n  id  | user_name       | pet_names        |\n------+-----------------|------------------|\n  15  | Kelley Ebert    | Moriah           |\n  16  | Hayley Schiller | Micheal, Magaret |\n...\n```\n\n\n",
