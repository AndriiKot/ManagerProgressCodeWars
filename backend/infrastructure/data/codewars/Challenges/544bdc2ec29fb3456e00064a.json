  "description": "Playing ping-pong can be **really fun**!\n\nUnfortunately, after a long and exciting play, you can forget whose service turn it is. Let's do something about that!\n\nWrite a function that takes as its parameter the **current score** as a string separated by `:`, and returns `\"first\"` or `\"second\"` depending on whose service turn it is.\n\nWe're playing old-school, so the rule is that players take turns after every five services. That is until the score is `20:20` - from that moment each player serves twice, in turn.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nat score  \"0:0\",  player to serve is \"first\"\nat score  \"3:2\",  player to serve is \"second\"\nat score \"21:20\", player to serve is \"first\"\nat score \"21:22\", player to serve is \"second\"\n```\n\nThere's no need to check if the passed parameter is valid - the score will be always provided in correct syntax and you don't need to check if one of the players has already won - that won't be the case.\n\nThe game ends when one of the players reaches `21` points with a minimum `2` point lead.  \nAfter a score of `20:20`, the winner will be the first player to reach a `2` point lead.",
