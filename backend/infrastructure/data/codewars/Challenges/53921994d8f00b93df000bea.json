  "description": "Welcome to the Mathematics gameshow. I'm your host, Apex Rhombus, and it's time for the lightning round!\n\nToday we'll talk about a hypothetical bottle. This entire bottle weighs 120 grams. Its contents weigh twice as much as the bottle itself. What, may I ask, do the contents weigh?\n\n...Did you guess 80 grams? Correct! Now that you've got that idea, I'm gonna ask you that question in many different ways so you'd better get ready!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet's complete the function that takes in two parameters: `bottle weight` and `scale`. This function will return the weight of the contents inside the bottle.\n\n* `bottle weight` will be an integer representing the weight of the entire bottle (contents included).\n\n* `scale` will be a string that you will need to parse. It will tell you how the content weight compares to the weight of the bottle by itself. `2 times larger`, `6 times larger`, and `15 times smaller` would all be valid strings (smaller and larger are the only comparison words). \n\nIt is guaranteed that the result will always be an integer. Good luck!",
