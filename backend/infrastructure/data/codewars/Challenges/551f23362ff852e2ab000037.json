  "description": "### Lyrics...\n\nPyramids are amazing! Both in architectural and mathematical sense. If you have a computer, you can mess with pyramids even if you are not in Egypt at the time. For example, let's consider the following problem: imagine that you have a pyramid built of numbers, like the ones here:\n\n<pre style=\"font-size:125%;line-height:150%\">\n    <span style=\"color:red\">3</span>                <span style=\"color:red\">10</span>\n   <span style=\"color:red\">7</span> 4             10  <span style=\"color:red\">20</span>\n  2 <span style=\"color:red\">4</span> 6          10  <span style=\"color:red\">10</span>  20\n 8 5 <span style=\"color:red\">9</span> 3       10  <span style=\"color:red\">90</span>  10  20\n</pre>\n\n### Here comes the task...\n\nLet's say that the *'slide down'* is the maximum sum of consecutive numbers from the top to the bottom of the pyramid. As you can see, the largest *'slide downs'* are `3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23`, and `10 + 20 + 10 + 90 = 130`.\n\nYour task is to write a function that takes a pyramid representation as an argument and returns its __largest__ *'slide down'*. For example:\n\n* With the input `[[3], [7, 4], [2, 4, 6], [8, 5, 9, 3]]`, your function should return `23`.\n* With the input `[[10], [10, 20], [10, 10, 20], [10, 90, 10, 20]]`, your function should return `130`.\n\n### By the way...\n\nTests include some extraordinarily high pyramids so as you can guess, brute-force method is a bad idea unless you have a few centuries to waste. You must come up with something more clever than that.\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n### Encodings...\n\npurity: `LetRec`  \nnumEncoding: `BinaryScott`  \nexport constructors `nil, cons` for your `List` encoding  \n~~~\n\n(c) This task is a lyrical version of __Problem 18__ and/or __Problem 67__ on [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net).\n",
