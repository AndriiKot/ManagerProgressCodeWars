  "description": "You've just discovered a square (`NxN`) field and you notice a warning sign. The sign states that there's a single bomb in the 2D grid-like field in front of you. \n\nWrite a function that accepts a 2D array, and returns the location of the mine. The mine is represented as the integer `1` in the 2D array. Areas in the 2D array that are not the mine will be represented as `0`s. \n\nThe location returned should be an array (`Tuple<int, int>` in C#, `RAX:RDX` in NASM) where the first element is the row index, and the second element is the column index of the bomb location (both should be 0 based). All 2D arrays passed into your function will be a square (`NxN`), and there will only be one mine in the array.\n\n### Examples (Input --> Output)\n\n```javascript\n[ [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] ] --> [0, 0]\n\n[ [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0] ] --> [1, 1]\n\n[ [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0] ] --> [2, 1]\n```\n",
