  "description": "My washing machine uses ```water``` amount of water to wash ```load``` (in JavaScript and Python) or ```max_load``` (in Ruby) amount of clothes. You are given a ```clothes``` amount of clothes to wash.  For each single item of clothes above the load, the washing machine will use 10% more water (multiplicative) to clean.\n\nFor example, if the load is ```10```, the amount of water it requires is ```5``` and the amount of clothes to wash is ```14```, then you need ```5 * 1.1 ^ (14 - 10)``` amount of water.\n\nWrite a function ```howMuchWater``` (JS)/```how_much_water``` (Python and Ruby) to work out how much water is needed if you have a ```clothes``` amount of clothes.  The function will accept 3 arguments: - `water`, `load` (or `max_load`in Ruby) and `clothes`.\n\nMy washing machine is an old model that can only handle double the amount of ```load``` (or ```max_load```).  If the amount of ```clothes``` is more than 2 times the standard amount of ```load``` (```max_load```), return ```'Too much clothes'```.  The washing machine also cannot handle any amount of clothes less than ```load``` (```max_load```).  If that is the case, return ```'Not enough clothes'```.\n\nThe answer should be rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places.\n",
