  "description": "### The Problem\n\nConsider a flat board with pegs sticking out of one side. If you stretched a rubber band across the outermost pegs what is the set of pegs such that all other pegs are contained within the shape formed by the rubber band?\n\n![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/ConvexHull.png)\n\nMore specifically, for this kata you will be given a list of points represented as ```[x,y]``` co-ordinates. Your aim will be to return a sublist containing points that form the perimeter of a polygon that encloses all other points contained within the original list.\n\n### Notes:\n\nThe tests may include duplicate and/or co-linear points. Co-linear points are a set of points which fall on the same straight line. Neither should be included in your returned sublist\n\nFor simplicity, there will always be at least 3 points\n\n### Help:\n\nCheck out wikipedia's page on [convex hulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull)\n\n```if:python\nNote for python users: `scipy` module has been disabled.\n```",
