  "description": "The Abundancy (A) of a number `n` is defined as:\n\n## (sum of divisors of n) / n\n\nFor example:\n```python\nA(8) = (1 + 2 + 4 + 8) / 8 = 15/8\n\nA(25) = (1 + 5 + 25) / 25  = 31/25\n```\n\nFriendly Pairs are pairs of numbers (m, n), such that their abundancies are equal: A(n) = A(m).\n\nWrite a function that returns `\"Friendly!\"` if the two given numbers are a Friendly Pair. Otherwise return their respective abundacies as strings separated by a space, e.g. `\"1 15/8\"`\n\nNotes:\n\n- All fractions must be written in their most reduced form (e.g. `2/3` instead of `8/12`)\n- Every number that is being checked is under 2400 \n- Floats should be left on without rounding when you compare the abundancies of the two numbers\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\nn = 6, m = 28 ==> \"Friendly!\"\n\nn = 3, m = 9  ==> \"4/3 13/9\"\n```",
