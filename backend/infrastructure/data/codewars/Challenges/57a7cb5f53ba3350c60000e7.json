  "description": "You are building a pagination control that will meet the following requirements:\n\n- Should always show the first and last page\n- Should show N pages to navigate before and after the current page (not counting the first and last)\n- If there is a single page it should return an empty array\n\nFor example:\n\n- Total pages: 10\n- Current page: 5\n- Items before/after: 2\n- Expected: `[1,` (always) `3,4` (2 before) `,5,` (center) `6,7,` (2 after) `10]` (always)\n\nAnother example:\n\n- Total pages: 36\n- Current page: 1\n- Items before and after: 5\n- Expected `[1` (always) `2,3,4,5,6` (5 before) `,7,` (center) `8,9,10,11,12,` (5 after) `36]` (always)\n\n![img1](https://i.imgur.com/EKIyxc9.png)\n\nCurrent page 7:\n\n![img2](https://i.imgur.com/uVmc161.png)\n\nCurrent page 8:\n\n![img3](https://i.imgur.com/O6AlTL8.png)\n\nThe \"center\" is one way to look at it. The important thing is that the number of pages keep consistent so the user will have a nice experience.\n\nWhen the current page is, for example, 1 if you subtract 5 from the \"center\" you would get negative values. Negative pages are invalid, so you have to compensate these pages to the right side. The same goes when your page goes over the total pages, you have to compensate left.\n\nComplete the function so it returns an array with the items for you to render on screen!\n\nYou can use the pre-loaded `printPages` to see how your result looks like.",
