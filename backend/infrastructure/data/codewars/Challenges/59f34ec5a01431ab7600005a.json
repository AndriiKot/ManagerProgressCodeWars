  "description": "In this Kata, you will implement a function `count` that takes an integer and returns the number of digits in `factorial(n)`. \n\nFor example, `count(5) = 3`, because `5! = 120`, and `120` has `3` digits.  \n\nMore examples in the test cases. \n\nBrute force is not possible. A little research will go a long way, as this is a well known series.\n\nGood luck!\n\nPlease also try:\n\n",
