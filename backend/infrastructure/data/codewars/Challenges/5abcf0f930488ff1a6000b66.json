  "description": "There is truly no magic in the world; the Hogwarts Sorting Hat is SQL-based, its decision-making powers are common operators and prospectIve students are merely data - names, and two columns of qualities.\n\nstudents\n* id\n* name\n* quality1\n* quality2\n\nSlytherin are being quite strict this year and will only take students who are *evil* AND *cunning*.<br>\nGryffindor will take students who are *brave* but only if their second quality is NOT *evil*.<br>\nRavenclaw accepts students who are *studious* OR *intelligent*.<br>\nHufflepuff will simply take those who have the quality *hufflepuff*.\n\n(don't worry, for simplicity's sake 'brave' and 'studious' will only appear in quality1, and 'cunning' and 'intelligent' will only appear in quality2.)\n\nReturn the *id, name, quality1* and *quality2* of all the students who'll be accepted, ordered by ascending id.",
