  "description": "Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as a list, where:\n\nThe indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.\nThe values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.\nSo if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500.\n\nWrite a method that takes a list of yesterday's stock prices and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.\n\nWatch out! What if the stock value goes down all day? In that case, the best profit will be negative!\n\nYou need to return the optimum buy and sell price, as well as the optimum profit made from the sale, in the format of an array with three indices. \n\ne.g. [optimum_buy_price, optimum_sell_price, profit]",
