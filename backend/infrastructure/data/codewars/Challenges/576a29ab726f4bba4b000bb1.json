  "description": "The 26 letters of the English alphabets are randomly divided into 5 groups of 5 letters with the remaining letter being ignored.  Each of the group is assigned a score of more than 0.  The ignored letter always has a score of 0.\n\nWith this kata, write a function to work out the score of a name that is passed to the function.\n\nThe output should be returned as an object:\n\n```javascript\n{'Mary Jane':20}\n```\n\nOnly letters have a score. Spaces do not.\n\nYou can safely assume that ```name``` does not contain any punctuations or symbols.  There will also be no ```empty string``` or ```null``` value.\n\nA static ```alpha``` object for testing has been preloaded for your convenience in the following format:\n\n```\n{'ABCDE':1, 'FGHIJ':2, 'KLMNO':3, 'PQRST':4, 'UVWXY':5}\n\n'Z' is ignored\n```\n\n```if-not:python\nNote that the ```alpha``` object will be randomly generated each time you run the test.\n```\n\n### Example\n\nIn accordance to the above ```alpha``` object, the name ```Mary Jane``` will have a name score of ```20``` => M=3 + a=1 + r=4 + y=5 + J=2 + a=1 + n=3 + e=1",
