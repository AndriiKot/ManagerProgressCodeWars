  "description": "- In the planet named Hoiyama, scientists are trying to find the weights of the mountains. \n- They managed to find the weights of some mountains.\n- But calculating them manually takes a really long time.\n- That's why they hired you to develop an algorithm and easily calculate the weights of the mountains.\n- Your function has only one parameter which is the width of the mountain and you need to return the weight of that mountain.\n- _The widths of the mountains are only odd numbers._\n- They gave you some information about calculating the weight of a mountain. \n- Examine the information given below and develop a solution accordingly.\n\n```\nwidth = 3\n\n          3          ->  3\n        1,2,1        ->  4\n                      +___\n               weight:   7\n```\n\n```\nwidth = 5\n\n          5          ->  5\n        3,4,3        -> 10\n      1,2,3,2,1      ->  9\n                      +___\n               weight:  24\n```\n```\nwidth = 7\n\n          7          ->  7\n        5,6,5        -> 16\n      3,4,5,4,3      -> 19\n    1,2,3,4,3,2,1    -> 16\n                      +___\n               weight:  58\n```\n```\nwidth = 9\n\n          9          ->  9\n        7,8,7        -> 22\n      5,6,7,6,5      -> 29\n    3,4,5,6,5,4,3    -> 30\n  1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1  -> 25\n                      +___\n               weight: 115\n```\n```\nwidth = 17\n\n                   17                  ->  17\n                15,16,15               ->  46\n             13,14,15,14,13            ->  69\n          11,12,13,14,13,12,11         ->  86\n        9,10,11,12,13,12,11,10,9       ->  97\n       7,8,9,10,11,12,11,10,9,8,7      -> 102\n      5,6,7,8,9,10,11,10,9,8,7,6,5     -> 101\n     3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3    ->  94\n    1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1  ->  81\n                                        +____\n                                  weight: 693\n```",
