  "description": "Alan is going to watch the Blood Moon (lunar eclipse) tonight for the first time in his life. But his\nmother, who is a history teacher, thinks the Blood Moon comes with an evil intent. The ancient Inca\npeople interpreted the deep red coloring as a jaguar attacking and eating the moon. But who\nbelieves in Inca myths these days? So, Alan decides to prove to her mom that there is no jaguar.\nHow? Well, only little Alan knows that. For now, he needs a small help from you. Help him solve the\nfollowing calculations so that he gets enough time to prove it before the eclipse starts.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/jRd3Z1K/Screenshot-3.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-3\" border=\"0\">\n\nThree semicircles are drawn on `$ \\overline{AB}$`, `$ \\overline{AD}$`, and `$ \\overline{AF}$`. \n\nThe following are true:\n* `$\\ C$` is the midpoint `$\\overline{AB}$`\n* `$ \\overline{CD} $` is perpendicular to `$\\overline{AB}$` \n* `$ \\overline{CF}$` is perpendicular to `$ \\overline{AD}$` \n\n## Task\n\nGiven the radius of the semicircle `ADBCA`, find out the area of the lune `AGFHA` (the shaded area).",
