  "description": "The flatMap() method first maps each element using a mapping function, then flattens the result into a new array. It is identical to a map followed by a flatten of depth 1, but flatMap is quite often useful and merging both into one method is slightly more efficient.\n\nfor example: we have an array arr = [0,1,2] , we have mapping function (x => [x, x+1]).\nwe expect: arr.flatMap(x => [x, x+1]) = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n\nGood luck!\n\n",
