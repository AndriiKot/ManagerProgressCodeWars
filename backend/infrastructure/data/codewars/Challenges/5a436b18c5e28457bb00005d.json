  "description": "You have a class called Node, representing a node in a binary tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree). \n\nEach node has 2 children - the right child and the left child. These children can of course be null.\n\nYou job is to add an instance method, height, which returns the longest branch steming from the tree (starting from this node). For example, this tree would result in 3:\n\n            (Node)\n            /    \\\n        (Node)  (Node)\n        /          \\\n      (Node)      (Node)\n           \\\n          (Node)\n          \nRecursion is not necessary, but highly recommended.
