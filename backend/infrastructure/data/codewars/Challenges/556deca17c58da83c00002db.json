  "description": "Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.\n\nAs the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(\n\nSo, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with `[1, 1, 1]` as a starting input (AKA *signature*), we have this sequence:\n\n```\n[1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]\n```\n\nBut what if we started with `[0, 0, 1]` as a signature? As starting with `[0, 1]` instead of `[1, 1]` basically *shifts* the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:\n\n```\n[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]\n```\n\nWell, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a **signature** array/list, returns **the first n elements - signature included** of the so seeded sequence.\n\nSignature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if `n == 0`, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)\n\nIf you enjoyed this kata more advanced and generalized version of it can be found in the <a href=\"http://www.codewars.com/kata/fibonacci-tribonacci-and-friends\"  target=\"_blank\" title=\"Xbonacci sequence\">Xbonacci kata</a>\n\n*[Personal thanks to Professor <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/instructor/jimfowler\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jim Fowler\">Jim Fowler</a> on Coursera for his awesome classes that I really recommend to any math enthusiast and for showing me this mathematical curiosity too with his usual contagious passion :)]*",
