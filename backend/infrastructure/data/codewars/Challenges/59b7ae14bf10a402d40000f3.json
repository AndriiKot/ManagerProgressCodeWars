  "description": "A twin prime is a prime number that differs from another prime number by `2`. Write a function named `is_twin_prime` which takes an `int` parameter and returns `true` if it is a twin prime, else `false`.\n\n### Examples\n\n```\ngiven 5, which is prime\n5 + 2 = 7, which is prime \n5 - 2 = 3, which is prime\nhence, 5 has two prime twins and it is a Twin Prime.\n```\n\n```\ngiven 7, which is prime\n7 - 2 = 5, which is prime\n7 + 2 = 9. which is not prime\nhence, 7 has one prime twin, and it is a Twin Prime.\n```\n\n```\ngiven 9, which is not prime \nhence, 9 is not a Twin Prime\n```\n\n```\ngiven 953, which is prime\n953 - 2 = 951, which is not prime\n953 + 2 = 955, which is not prime \nhence, 953 is not a Twin Prime\n```\n",
