  "description": "# Gary is wondering if the sun is shining. \n\nIn his universe, the sun can only be shining when the temperature is above 20 deg C. \n\nTemperatures can also be negative, there are no bounds like [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero). \n\nAdditionally, there must be no clouds blocking the sun's rays.\n\nThe weather station provides the input values, using the following structure:\n\n```\ntemperature (String): \"x deg C\", where x is any positive or negative Int.\n\nclouds (Boolean): True indicating that there are clouds.\n```\n\nThe goal is to write a function `doesSunShine` that returns a boolean value, with True indicating that the sun is shining.\n\n# Examples\n\n```\ndoesSunShine \"25 deg C\" False `shouldBe` True\ndoesSunShine \"25 deg C\" True `shouldBe` False\ndoesSunShine \"15 deg C\" True `shouldBe` False\n```",
