  "description": "## Background - the Collatz Conjecture:\n\nImagine you are given a positive integer, `n`, then:\n\n* if `n` is even, calculate: `n / 2`\n* if `n` is odd, calculate: `3 * n + 1`\n\nRepeat until your answer is `1`. The Collatz conjecture states that performing this operation repeatedly, you will always eventually reach `1`.\n\nYou can try creating Collatz sequences with [this](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5286b2e162056fd0cb000c20) kata. For further information, see the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).\n\n## Now! Your task:\n\n**Given an array of positive integers, return the integer whose Collatz sequence is the longest.**\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nlongestCollatz([2, 4, 3])===3;\n```\n```python\nlongest_collatz([2, 4, 3])==3\n```\n```ruby\nlongest_collatz([2, 4, 3])==3\n```\n\nExplanation: The Collatz sequence for `2` has a length of `1`, the sequence for `4` has a length of `2`, and the sequence for `3` has a length of `7`. So from our array, the integer `3` is the one with the longest Collatz sequence.\n\nHence, your function should return `3`.\n\n\n## Note:\n\nThere may be more than one answer, i.e. two or more integers produce the longest Collatz sequence, because they happen to have sequences of the same length. **In this case, your function should return the integer that appears first in the array.**\n\nExample:\nGiven an array: `[2, 5, 32]`, both `5` and `32` have Collatz sequences of length 5. These are also the longest sequences from our array.\n\nIn this case, our function returns `5`, because `5` comes before `32` in our array.\n\n",
