  "description": "This is simple version of harder [Square Sums](/kata/square-sums).\n\n# Square sums\n\nWrite function `square_sums_row` ( or `squareSumsRow` or `SquareSumsRow` ) that, given integer number `N` (in range `2..43`), returns array of integers `1..N` arranged in a way, so sum of each 2 consecutive numbers is a square.\n\nSolution is valid if and only if following two criterias are met:\n1. Each number in range `1..N` is used once and only once.\n2. Sum of each 2 consecutive numbers is a perfect square.\n\n### Example\n\nFor N=15 solution could look like this:\n\n`[ 9, 7, 2, 14, 11, 5, 4, 12, 13, 3, 6, 10, 15, 1, 8 ]`\n\n### Verification\n\n1. All numbers are used once and only once. When sorted in ascending order array looks like this:\n\n`[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ]`\n\n2. Sum of each 2 consecutive numbers is a perfect square:\n\n```\n   16    16     16     16     16     16     16\n   /+\\   /+\\    /+\\    /+\\    /+\\    /+\\    /+\\\n[ 9, 7, 2, 14, 11, 5, 4, 12, 13, 3, 6, 10, 15, 1, 8 ]\n      \\+/    \\+/    \\+/    \\+/    \\+/    \\+/    \\+/\n       9     25      9     25      9     25      9\n\n 9 = 3*3\n16 = 4*4\n25 = 5*5\n```\n\nIf there is no solution, return `false` ( `None` in Scala, `Nothing` in Haskell ). For example if `N=5`, then numbers `1,2,3,4,5` cannot be put into square sums row: `1+3=4`, `4+5=9`, but `2` has no pairs and cannot link `[1,3]` and `[4,5]`.\n\n# Have fun!\n\nHarder version of this Kata is [here](/kata/square-sums).",
