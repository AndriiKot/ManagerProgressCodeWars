  "description": "# One is the loneliest number\n\n## Task\n\nThe range of vision of a digit is its own value. `1` can see one digit to the left and one digit to the right,` 2` can see two digits, and so on.\n\nThus, the loneliness of a digit `N` is the sum of the digits which it can see.\n\nGiven a non-negative integer, your funtion must determine if there's at least one digit `1` in this integer such that its loneliness value is minimal.\n\n## Example\n\n```\nnumber = 34315\n```\n\ndigit | can see on the left | can see on the right | loneliness\n--- | --- | --- | ---\n3 | - | 431 | 4 + 3 + 1 = <span style=\"color:red\">8</span>\n4 | 3 | 315 | 3 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 12\n3 | 34 | 15 | 3 + 4 + 1 + 5 = 13\n1 | 3 | 5 | 3 + 5 = <span style=\"color:red\">8</span>\n5 | 3431 | - | 3 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 11\n\nIs there a `1` for which the loneliness is minimal? Yes.\n",
