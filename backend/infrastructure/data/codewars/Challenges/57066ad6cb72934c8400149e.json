That's just who he is.\n\nTo stop having to count like a mere mortal chuck developed his own special code using the hairs on his beard. You do not need to know the details of how it works, you simply need to know that the format is as follows: 'A8A8A8A8A8.-A%8.88.'\n\nIn Chuck's code, 'A' can be any capital letter and '8' can be any number 0-9 and any %, - or . symbols must not be changed.\n\nYour task, to stop Chuck beating your ass with his little finger, is to use regex to verify if the number is a genuine Chuck score. If not it's probably some crap made up by his nemesis Bruce Lee. Return true if the provided count passes, and false if it does not.  \n\n```Javascript\nExample:\n     'A8A8A8A8A8.-A%8.88.' <- don't forget final full stop :D\\n\nTests:\n     'A2B8T1Q9W4.-F%5.34.' == true;\n     'a2B8T1Q9W4.-F%5.34.' == false; (small letter)\n     'A2B8T1Q9W4.-F%5.3B.' == false; (last char should be number) \n     'A2B8T1Q9W4.£F&5.34.' == false; (symbol changed from - and %)\n ```\n\nThe pattern only needs to appear within the text. The full input can be longer, i.e. the pattern can be surrounded by other characters... Chuck loves to be surrounded!\n\nReady, steady, VERIFY!!",
