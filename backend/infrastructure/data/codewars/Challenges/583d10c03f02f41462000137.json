Your task is to calculate the sum value of each range (start index and end index are both inclusive), and return the maximum sum value.\n```\n```if:ruby\nGiven an array (`arr`) of integers and an array (`ranges`) of ranges (e.g. `[[1, 32], [16, 24],...]`), which represent an index range of `arr`, calculate the sum of each range (start index and end index are both inclusive) of `arr`, and return the maximum sum.\n```\n```if:php\nGiven an array `$a` that contains some integers and a `$range` list such as `[[$start1, $end1], [$start2, $end2], ... ]` where `$start(n)` and `$end(n)` are valid keys of the non-associative array `$a` and `$start(n)` is always guaranteed to be strictly less than `$end(n)`.  Your task is to calculate the sum value of each range (start index and end index are both inclusive) and return the maximum sum value.\n```\n```if:haskell\nGiven a list `arr` that contains some integers(positive, negative or 0), and a `range` list such as `[(start1,end1),(start2,end2),...]`, start and end are the index of `arr` and start always less than end.
