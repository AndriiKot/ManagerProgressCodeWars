  "description": "Similarly to the [previous kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/string-subpattern-recognition-i/), you will need to return a boolean value if the base string can be expressed as the repetition of one subpattern.\n\nThis time there are two small changes:\n\n* if a subpattern has been used, it will be present at least twice, meaning the subpattern has to be shorter than the original string;\n* the strings you will be given might or might not be created repeating a given subpattern, then shuffling the result.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\n\"a\" --> false; //no repeated shorter sub-pattern, just one character\n\"aaaa\" --> true; //just one character repeated\n\"abcd\" --> false; //no repetitions\n\"babababababababa\" --> true; //repeated \"ba\"\n\"bbabbaaabbaaaabb\" --> true; //same as above, just shuffled\n```\n\nStrings will never be empty and can be composed of any character (just consider upper- and lowercase letters as different entities) and can be pretty long (keep an eye on performances!).\n\nIf you liked it, go for either the [previous kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/string-subpattern-recognition-i/) or the [next kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/string-subpattern-recognition-iii/) of the series!\n",
