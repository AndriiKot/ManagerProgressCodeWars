  "description": "<i>Luke 17:23: \n\nNeither shall they say: Behold here, or behold there. For you see, the kingdom of God [Heaven] is within you.</i>\n\nThis passage suggests that Heaven and Hell are not merely physical locations or afterlife destinations but are states of being that can be experienced here and now, within oneself. Heaven can be understood as the peace and fulfillment that comes from living a life aligned with virtue, while Hell might represent the turmoil and suffering that often accompany a life led astray by vice.\n\nInspired by Chris Rea's song \"[The Road to Hell,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUUdQfnshJ4)\" this SQL query task is designed to explore a metaphorical journey through life's choices and their consequences. The journey represents the path one takes, with each stop symbolizing different life experiences marked by either virtues or vices. The task is to retrieve data that narrates these metaphorical journeys, some leading to \"Hell\" and others to different outcomes.\n\nWrite a SQL query that extracts and presents information about various metaphorical journeys, showing each journey’s path through different stations (representing vices and virtues) and identifying those that ultimately end in \"Hell.\"\n\nDB Schema:\n\n`stations`:\n\n* `id` (integer, primary key)\n* `station_name` (string)\n\n`journey`:\n\n* `id` (integer, primary Key)\n* `journey_name` (string)\n\n`journey_stop`:\n\n* `journey_id` (integer, foreign key to `journey.id`)\n* `station_id` (integer, foreign key to `stations.id`)\n* `sequence_number` (integer)\n\nIdentify journeys that end at the station named \"Hell\". In these journeys, \"Hell\" is always the final destination, not a passing station. Your result set should return 2 columns: `journey_name` and `station_name`\n\n1) Display the `journey` for the first stop of each journey. For subsequent stops of the same journey, display `NULL` in place of the `journey_name`.\n2) For `station_name`, concatenate the `station_name` with the `sequence_number` in brackets in the format of  `station_name (sequence_number)`.\n\nOrder the results by `journey_id` and `sequence_number` - both in ascending order.\n\nGLHF!\n\n### Desired Output\n\nThe desired output should look like this:\n\n```\n| journey             | station_name    |\n+---------------------+-----------------+\n| Journey of Ambition | Greed (1)       |\n| <null>              | Pride (2)       |\n| <null>              | Hell (3)        |\n| Path of Desire      | Lust (1)        |\n| <null>              | Envy (2)        |\n| <null>              | Hell (3)        |\n```\n",
