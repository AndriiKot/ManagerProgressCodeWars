  "description": "Write a function that takes a positive integer and returns the next smaller positive integer containing the same digits.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\nnextSmaller(21) == 12\nnextSmaller(531) == 513\nnextSmaller(2071) == 2017\n```\n```haskell\nnextSmaller(21) == 12\nnextSmaller(531) == 513\nnextSmaller(2071) == 2017\n```\n```csharp\nnextSmaller(21) == 12\nnextSmaller(531) == 513\nnextSmaller(2071) == 2017\n```\n```python\nnext_smaller(21) == 12\nnext_smaller(531) == 513\nnext_smaller(2071) == 2017\n```\n```ruby\nnext_smaller(21) == 12\nnext_smaller(531) == 513\nnext_smaller(2071) == 2017\n```\n```rust\nnext_smaller(21) == Some(12)\nnext_smaller(531) == Some(513)\nnext_smaller(2071) == Some(2017)\n```\n\nReturn -1 (for `Haskell`: return `Nothing`, for `Rust`: return `None`), when there is no smaller number that contains the same digits. Also return -1 when the next smaller number with the same digits would require the leading digit to be zero.\n\n```javascript\nnextSmaller(9) == -1\nnextSmaller(111) == -1\nnextSmaller(135) == -1\nnextSmaller(1027) == -1 // 0721 is out since we don't write numbers with leading zeros\n```\n```csharp\nnextSmaller(9) == -1\nnextSmaller(111) == -1\nnextSmaller(135) == -1\nnextSmaller(1027) == -1 // 0721 is out since we don't write numbers with leading zeros\n```\n```haskell\nnextSmaller(9) == Nothing\nnextSmaller(135) == Nothing\nnextSmaller(1027) == Nothing -- 0721 is out since we don't write numbers with leading zeros\n```\n```python \nnext_smaller(9) == -1\nnext_smaller(135) == -1\nnext_smaller(1027) == -1  # 0721 is out since we don't write numbers with leading zeros\n```\n```ruby \nnext_smaller(9) == -1\nnext_smaller(135) == -1\nnext_smaller(1027) == -1  # 0721 is out since we don't write numbers with leading zeros\n```\n```rust\nnext_smaller(9) == None\nnext_smaller(135) == None\nnext_smaller(1027) == None  // 0721 is out since we don't write numbers with leading zeros\n```\n\n * some tests will include very large numbers.\n * test data only employs positive integers.\n\n*The function you write for this challenge is the inverse of this kata: \"[Next bigger number with the same digits](http://www.codewars.com/kata/next-bigger-number-with-the-same-digits).\"*\n",
