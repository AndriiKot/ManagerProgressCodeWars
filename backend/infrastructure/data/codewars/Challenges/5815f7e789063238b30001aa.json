  "description": "The year is 2088 and the Radical Marxist Socialist People's Party (RMSPP) has just seized power in Brazil.\n\nTheir first act in power is absolute wealth equality through coercive redistribution.\n\nCreate a function that redistributes all wealth equally among all citizens.\n\nWealth is represented as an array/list where every index is the wealth of a single citizen.  \nThe function should mutate the input such that every index has the same amount of wealth.  \n\nSee example:\n\n* Input:\n```text\n[5, 10, 6]  >>> This represents:\n             # citizen 1 has wealth 5\n             # citizen 2 has wealth 10\n             # citizen 3 has wealth 6\n```\n* Should be after the test:\n```text\n [7, 7, 7] >>> wealth has now been equally redistributed\n```\n\nInfo:\n\n- **MUTATE the input array/list, don't return anything**\n- Input is guaranteed to hold at least 1 citizen\n- Wealth of a citizen will be an integer with minimum equal to 0 (negative wealth is not possible)\n- Handling of floating point error will not be tested\n",
