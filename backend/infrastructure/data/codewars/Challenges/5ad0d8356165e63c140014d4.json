  "description": "Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.\n\nThis function should take two arguments:\nexam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100);\nprojects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);\n\nThis function should return a number (final grade).\nThere are four types of final grades:\n- 100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.\n- 90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.\n- 75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.\n- 0, in other cases\n\nExamples(**Inputs**-->**Output**):\n```\n100, 12 --> 100\n99, 0 --> 100\n10, 15 --> 100\n\n85, 5 --> 90\n\n55, 3 --> 75\n\n55, 0 --> 0\n20, 2 --> 0\n```\n\n*Use Comparison and Logical Operators.\n",
