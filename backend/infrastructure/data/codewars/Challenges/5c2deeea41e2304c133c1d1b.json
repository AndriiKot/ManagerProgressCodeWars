  "description": "# Introduction\n\nYou are going to be given an array of arrays of integers as a first argument, which represents a rectangle.\nAs a second and third arguments you will be given center and side(length) of the inner square.\nYour task is to find inner square.\n\nLet's move on to examples, so it will be easier to understand.\n\n# Examples\n\n```javascript\nlet rect = [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],\n           [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\n           [10, 11, 12, 13, 14],\n           [15, 16, 17, 18, 19],\n           [20, 21, 22, 23, 24]];\n```\n\n```javascript\nlet res1 = innerSquare(rect, 12, 3), res2 = innerSquare(rect, 14, 3), res3 = innerSquare(rect, 0, 3);\n```\n\n![examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zendorcode/codewars/master/authored/JavaScript/5%20kyu/Untitled.png)\n\n**Results:**\n```javascript\nres1 // [[6, 7, 8], [11, 12, 13], [16, 17, 18]]\nres2 // [[8, 9], [13, 14], [18, 19]]\nres3 // [[0, 1], [5, 6]]\n```\n\nIf the square is outside the boundaries of the rectangle, then it is clipped, as shown on the image.\n\n# Task\n\nWrite a function that returns array of arrays of integers which represents a inner square.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n`rect: 3 <= rows <= 10, 3 <= cols <= 10`\n\n`rect[0] <= center <= rect[rect.length - 1]`\n\n`0 < side < 10` - always an odd number\n\nThere are more examples in test cases.",
