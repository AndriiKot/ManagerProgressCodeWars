  "description": "<strong>Task</strong>\n\nFind the volume of the largest cube that will fit inside a cylinder of given height <code>h</code> and radius <code>r</code>.\n\nDon't round your result. The result needs to be within <code>0.01</code> error margin of the expected result.\n\nHINT: There are two cases to consider. Will it be the cylinder's height or the cylinder's radius that determines the maximum size of your cube? An if/else statement might be useful here.\n\n<strong>Two Examples</strong>\n```\n1. for height  3, radius 7 => should return  27.0\n2. for height 11, radius 5 => should return 353.55\n```",
