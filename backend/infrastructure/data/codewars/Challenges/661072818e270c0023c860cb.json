  "description": "### Given\n\nGiven two urns `urn1` and `urn2`, **two** marbles are drawn from **each** urn **without replacement** into a third urn `urn3`. From that urn, now containing **four** marbles, again **two** marbles are drawn **without replacement**. We know that **at least one** of those two marbles has color `color`. \n\n## Task\n\nReturn the **exact probability** as a ratio of the **other** marble having the **same** color.\n\n---\n\n### Input\n\n- `urn1`: an object depicting an urn where each key is a color (string), and each value the number of marbles of that color (integer)\n- `urn2`: an object depicting an urn where each key is a color (string), and each value the number of marbles of that color (integer)\n- `color`: the color of at least one of two marbles drawn from `urn3` (string) after two marbles were drawn from respectively `urn1` and `urn2` into `urn3`\n\n### Output\n\n- return the exact probability as ratio of the other marble having the same color `color` (array with 2 elements; the numerator (big integer) and denominator (big integer))\n\n### Constraints\n\n- the ratio needs to be in compact form: `[2, 4]` should be `[1, 2]`\n- `urn1` and `urn2` contain at least 2 marbles\n- the amount of marbles in both urns are reported **before** marbles are drawn and put into the third urn\n- the color is always available as key in both urns\n- at least one of both urns has at least one marble of the given color\n- the amount of marbles by color is a non-negative integer\n\n---\n\n### Kata Series\n\n- <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/66116892fe0da461e0b4b0df\">Drawing marbles from an urn - Part 1</a>\n- <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/66085aabab6d670024e2f431\">Drawing marbles from an urn - Part 2</a>\n- Drawing marbles from an urn - Part 3 (this kata)\n\n---\n\nGood luck, have fun!\n\n\n",
