  "description": "Create a function that finds the largest <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number\" target=\"_blank\">palindromic number</a> made from the product of **at least 2** of the given arguments.\n\n### Notes\n\n* Only non-negative numbers will be given in the argument\n* You don't need to use all the digits of the products\n* Single digit numbers are considered palindromes\n* Optimization is needed: dealing with ones and zeros in a smart way will help a lot\n\n<!--\nThis kata is quite demanding, as you will need to manage all possible combinations to get products, **then** use all or some of the digits of each product to get the largest palindrome: as you can easily guess, the computing time can easily grow exponentially, so you will need to work on optimization to be able to make it in the alloted time.\n-->\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n[937, 113] --> 81518\n```\nAs `937 * 113 = 105881` and the largest palindromic number that can be arranged from the digits of result is: `81518`\n\n\nAnother one:\n\n```\n[57, 62, 23] --> 82128\n\n             product     palindrome\n57 * 62      = 3534   -->  353\n57 * 23      = 1311   -->  131\n62 * 23      = 1426   -->  6\n57 * 62 * 23 = 81282  -->  82128\n```\n\nOne more:\n```\n[15, 125, 8] --> 8\n\n             product     palindrome\n15 * 125     = 1875   -->  8\n15 * 8       = 120    -->  2\n125 * 8      = 1000   -->  1\n15 * 125 * 8 = 15000  -->  5\n```",
