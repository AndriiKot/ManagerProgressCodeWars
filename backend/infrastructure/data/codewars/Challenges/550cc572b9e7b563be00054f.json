  "description": "Scheduling is how the processor decides which jobs (processes) get to use the processor and for how long. This can cause a lot of problems. Like a really long process taking the entire CPU and freezing all the other processes. One solution is Shortest Job First (SJF), which today you will be implementing.\n\nSJF works by, well, letting the shortest jobs take the CPU first. If the jobs are the same size then it is First In First Out (FIFO). The idea is that the shorter jobs will finish quicker, so theoretically jobs won't get frozen because of large jobs. (In practice they're frozen because of small jobs).\n\nYou will be implementing a function that takes in:\n\n1. \"jobs\", a non-empty array of positive integers. They represent the clock-cycles(cc) needed to finish the job.\n2. \"index\", a positive integer. That represents the job we're interested in.\n\nSJF returns:\n\n1. A positive integer representing the cc it takes to complete the job at index.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\njobs: [3, 10, 20, 1, 2]\nindex: 0\nat 0cc [3, 10, 20, 1, 2] jobs[3] starts\nat 1cc [3, 10, 20, 0, 2] jobs[3] finishes, jobs[4] starts\nat 3cc [3, 10, 20, 0, 0] jobs[4] finishes, jobs[0] starts\nat 6cc [0, 10, 20, 0, 0] jobs[0] finishes\nShould return 6, as it takes 6cc to complete the job at index 0\n```",
