  "description": "#Sorting on planet Twisted-3-7\n\nThere is a planet... in a galaxy far far away. It is exactly like our planet, but it has one difference:\n#The values of the digits 3 and 7 are twisted.\nOur 3 means 7 on the planet Twisted-3-7. And 7 means 3.\n\nYour task is to create a method, that can sort an array the way it would be sorted on Twisted-3-7.\n\n7 Examples from a friend from Twisted-3-7:\n```\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> [1,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,9]\n[12,13,14] -> [12,14,13]\n[9,2,4,7,3] -> [2,7,4,3,9]\n```\n\nThere is no need for a precheck. The array will always be not null and will always contain at least one number.\n\nYou should not modify the input array!\n\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) \n\nI have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!",
