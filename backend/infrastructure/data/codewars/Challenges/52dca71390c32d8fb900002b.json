  "description": "Finish the function ```numberToOrdinal```, which should take a number and return it as a string with the correct ordinal indicator suffix (in English).  That is:\n\n* ```numberToOrdinal(1) ==> '1st'```\n* ```numberToOrdinal(2) ==> '2nd'```\n* ```numberToOrdinal(3) ==> '3rd'```\n* ```numberToOrdinal(4) ==> '4th'```\n* ```... and so on```\n\nFor the purposes of this kata, you may assume that the function will always be passed a non-negative integer.  If the function is given 0 as an argument, it should return '0' (as a string).\n\nTo help you get started, here is an excerpt from Wikipedia's page on [Ordinal Indicators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#English): \n\n* st is used with numbers ending in 1 (e.g. 1st, pronounced first)\n* nd is used with numbers ending in 2 (e.g. 92nd, pronounced ninety-second)\n* rd is used with numbers ending in 3 (e.g. 33rd, pronounced thirty-third)\n* As an exception to the above rules, all the \"teen\" numbers ending with 11, 12 or 13 use -th (e.g. 11th, pronounced eleventh, 112th, pronounced one hundred [and] twelfth)\n* th is used for all other numbers (e.g. 9th, pronounced ninth).",
