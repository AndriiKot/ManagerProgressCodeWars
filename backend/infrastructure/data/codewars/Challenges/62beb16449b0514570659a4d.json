  "description": "You are playing a gambling game. In this game, you are offered `n` gambles, with the i<sup>th</sup> gamble having a probability p<sub>i</sub> of winning x<sub>i</sub> dollars. You can take each gamble at most once, and when you lose a gamble, the game ends (but you won't lose any money). Your task is to predetermine an order of taking the `n` gambles that **maximizes your expected gain** (i.e. the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) of your total gain).\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be given two arrays `p` and `x` each containing `n` (n≤10<sup>5</sup>) nonnegative real numbers (every p<sub>i</sub> is in the range `[0,1]` and every x<sub>i</sub> is within 2 decimal places), whose meanings are described above. The return value of your function should be a **permutation** of `1..n`, denoting the best order you choose **(it is guaranteed that there is only one solution)**.",
