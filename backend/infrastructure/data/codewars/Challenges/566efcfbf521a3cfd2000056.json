  "description": "You are going to be given a string. Your job is to return that string in a certain order that I will explain below:\n\nLet's say you start with this: `\"012345\"`\n\nThe first thing you do is reverse it:`\"543210\"`  \nThen you will take the string from the 1st position and reverse it again:`\"501234\"`  \nThen you will take the string from the 2nd position and reverse it again:`\"504321\"`  \nThen you will take the string from the 3rd position and reverse it again:`\"504123\"`\n\nContinue this pattern until you have done every single position, and then you will return the string you have created. For this particular number, you would return:`\"504132\"`\n\n# Input:\nA string of length 1 - 1000\n\n# Output:\nA correctly reordered string.\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n# Encodings\n\npurity: `LetRec`  \nnumEncoding: `None`  \n\n`String`s are encoded as `List`s. The values in the `String` don't actually matter!  \nExport constructors `nil, cons` and deconstructor `foldl` for your `List` encoding.\n~~~\n",
