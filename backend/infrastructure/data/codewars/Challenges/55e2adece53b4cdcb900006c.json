  "description": "Two tortoises named ***A*** and ***B*** must run a race. ***A*** starts with an average speed of ```720 feet per hour```.\nYoung ***B*** knows she runs faster than ***A***, and furthermore has not finished her cabbage.\n\nWhen she starts, at last, she can see that ***A*** has a `70 feet lead` but ***B***'s speed is `850 feet per hour`.\nHow long will it take ***B*** to catch ***A***?\n\nMore generally:\ngiven two speeds `v1` (***A***'s speed, integer > 0) and `v2` (***B***'s speed, integer > 0) and a lead `g` (integer > 0)\nhow long will it take ***B*** to catch ***A***? \n\nThe result will be an array ```[hour, min, sec]``` which is the time needed in hours, minutes and seconds (round down to the nearest second)\nor a string in some languages.\n\nIf `v1 >= v2` then return `nil`, `nothing`, `null`, `None` or `{-1, -1, -1}` for C++, C, Go, Nim, Pascal, COBOL, Erlang, `[-1, -1, -1]` for Perl,`[]` for Kotlin or \"-1 -1 -1\" for others.\n\n#### Examples:\n(form of the result depends on the language)\n```\nrace(720, 850, 70) => [0, 32, 18] or \"0 32 18\"\nrace(80, 91, 37)   => [3, 21, 49] or \"3 21 49\"\n```\n\n#### Note: \n\n- See other examples in \"Your test cases\".\n\n- In Fortran - as in any other language - the returned string is not permitted to contain any redundant trailing whitespace: you can use dynamically allocated character strings.\n\n** Hints for people who don't know how to convert to hours, minutes, seconds:\n\n- Tortoises don't care about fractions of seconds\n- Think of calculation by hand using only integers (in your code use or simulate integer division)\n- or Google: \"convert decimal time to hours minutes seconds\"\n",
