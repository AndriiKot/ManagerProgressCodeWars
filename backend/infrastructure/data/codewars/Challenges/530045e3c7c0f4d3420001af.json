  "description": "Your task is to create a function that will take an integer and return the result of the look-and-say function on that integer. This should be a general function that takes as input any positive integer, and returns an integer; inputs are not limited to the sequence which starts with \"1\".\n\n\nConway's Look-and-say sequence goes like this:\n\n- Start with a number.\n- *Look* at the number, and group consecutive digits together.\n- For each digit group, *say* the number of digits, then the digit itself.\n\nThis can be repeated on its result to generate the sequence.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Start with ``1``.\n- There is one ``1`` --> ``11``\n- Start with ``11``. There are two ``1`` digits --> ``21``\n- Start with ``21``. There is one ``2`` and one ``1`` --> ``1211``\n- Start with ``1211``. There is one ``1``, one ``2``, and two ``1``s --> ``111221``\n\nSample inputs and outputs::\n\n- `0` --> `10`\n- `2014` --> `12101114`\n- `9000` --> `1930`\n- `22322` --> `221322`\n- `222222222222` --> `122`",
