  "description": "# Reverse The Stack\n\nThis is a beginner friendly Kata to help you understand how a `Vec` can be used as a stack.\n\nIn this Kata, we'll be putting some self-imposed constraints (emphasis on self-imposed) to test our understanding of a vector.\n\n## Problem\nGiven an `input` of vector of numbers, return the reverse of all the elements in the array.\n\n## Constraints\n\n1. Do not use the `reverse()` function\n2. Treat `input` as a stack and solve the Kata using stack related methods\n\n## Example\n\ninput: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\noutput: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n\nExplanation: The last element of input is the first element of output, the second last element of input is the second element of output, and so on.",
