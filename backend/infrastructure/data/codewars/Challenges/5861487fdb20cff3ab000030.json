  "description": "# Esolang Interpreters #4 - Boolfuck Interpreter\n\n## About this Kata Series\n\n\"Esolang Interpreters\" is a Kata Series that originally began as three separate, independent esolang interpreter Kata authored by [@donaldsebleung](http://codewars.com/users/donaldsebleung) which all shared a similar format and were all somewhat inter-related.  Under the influence of [a fellow Codewarrior](https://www.codewars.com/users/nickkwest), these three high-level inter-related Kata gradually evolved into what is known today as the \"Esolang Interpreters\" series.\n\nThis series is a high-level Kata Series designed to challenge the minds of bright and daring programmers by implementing interpreters for various [esoteric programming languages/Esolangs](http://esolangs.org), mainly [Brainfuck](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) derivatives but not limited to them, given a certain specification for a certain Esolang.  Perhaps the only exception to this rule is the very first Kata in this Series which is intended as an introduction/taster to the world of esoteric programming languages and writing interpreters for them.\n\n## The Language\n\nBoolfuck is an [esoteric programming language (Esolang)](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) based on the famous [Brainfuck](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) (also an Esolang) which was invented in 2004 or 2005 according to [the official website](http://samuelhughes.com/boof/index.html).  It is very similar to Brainfuck except for a few key differences:\n\n- Boolfuck works with bits as opposed to bytes\n- The tape for Brainfuck contains exactly 30,000 cells with the pointer starting from the very left; Boolfuck contains an infinitely long tape with the pointer starting at the \"middle\" (since the tape can be extended indefinitely either direction)\n- Each cell in Boolfuck can only contain the values `0` or `1` (i.e. bits not bytes) as opposed to Brainfuck which has cells containing values ranging from `0` to `255` inclusive.\n- The output command in Boolfuck is `;` NOT `.`\n- The `-` command does **not** exist in Boolfuck since either `+` or `-` would flip a bit anyway\n\nAnyway, here is a list of commands and their descriptions:\n\n- `+` - Flips the value of the bit under the pointer\n- `,` - Reads a bit from the input stream, storing it under the pointer. The end-user types information using characters, though. Bytes are read in little-endian order—the first bit read from the character `a`, for instance, is 1, followed by 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, and finally 0. If the end-of-file has been reached, outputs a zero to the bit under the pointer.\n- `;` - Outputs the bit under the pointer to the output stream. The bits get output in little-endian order, the same order in which they would be input. If the total number of bits output is not a multiple of eight at the end of the program, the last character of output gets padded with zeros on the more significant end.\n- `<` - Moves the pointer left by 1 bit\n- `>` - Moves the pointer right by 1 bit\n- `[` - If the value under the pointer is `0` then skip to the corresponding `]`\n- `]` - Jumps back to the matching `[` character, if the value under the pointer is `1`\n\nIf you haven't written an interpreter for Brainfuck yet I recommend you to complete [this Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/my-smallest-code-interpreter-aka-brainf-star-star-k) first.\n\n## The Task\n\nWrite a Boolfuck interpreter which accepts up to two arguments.  The first (required) argument is the Boolfuck code in the form of a string.  The second (optional) argument is the input passed in by the **end-user** (i.e. as actual characters not bits) which should default to `\"\"` if not provided.  Your interpreter should return the output as actual characters (not bits!) as a string.\n```javascript\nfunction boolfuck (code, input = \"\")\n```\n```c\nchar* boolfuck (char *code, char *in)\n```\n```cpp\nchar* boolfuck (const char *code, const char *in)\n```\n```java\npublic static String interpret (String code, String input)\n```\n```fsharp\nlet interpret (code: string) (input: string) : string\n```\n```python\ndef boolfuck(code, input)\n```\n```go\nfunc Boolfuck(code, input string) string\n```\n```rust\nfn boolfuck(code: &str, input: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8>\n```\n```haskell\nboolfuck :: String -> String -> String\n```\n\nPreloaded for you is a function `brainfuckToBoolfuck()`/`brainfuck_to_boolfuck()`/`BrainfuckToBoolfuck()` which accepts 1 required argument (the Brainfuck code) and returns its Boolfuck equivalent should you find it useful.\n\nPlease note that your interpreter should simply ignore any non-command characters.  **This will be tested in the test cases.**\n\nIf in doubt, feel free to refer to the official website (link at top).\n\nGood luck :D\n\n## Kata in this Series\n\n1.
