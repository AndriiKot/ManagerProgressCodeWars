  "description": "In this kata you have a `20` x `20` preloaded array of oil saturation in some region. Your task is to answer whether it is efficient to place the well at the given point. A well is efficient if its efficiency is bigger or equal to given threshold.\n\nInput parameters in that function are:\n<ul>\n<li> <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> integer coordinates of the well (indexes of 2D array, using <b>x</b> for rows, <b>y</b> for columns) </li>\n<li> efficiency threshold (float or integer) </li>\n</ul>\n  \nThe preloaded `FIELD` contains values from `0.00` to `0.99` inclusive, such as:\n```\n0.98, 0.65, 0.23, 0.39, 0.99...\n```\n(In Python and Ruby each value is stored as a `string`. In C each value is stored as a `double`)\n\nExamples of usage:\n```\nx = 10\ny = 10\nthreshold = 3.5\nexpected result => True / true\n\nx = 7\ny = 3\nthreshold = 4.5\nexpected result => False / false\n```\n\nTo calculate the current efficiency of a well, you should sum up all saturations of cells adjacent to the specified cell plus the saturation of the specified cell itself.\n\nThe efficiency of the marked point with `0.43` is `5.3` (sum of all cells in square).\n    \nIf you need to calculate the efficiency at the edge of the field, you should just take in account only cells in the field.\n\n\n",
