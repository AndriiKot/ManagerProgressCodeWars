  "description": "I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others. \n\nI would like for you to write me a function that, when given a number `n` (`n >= 1` ), returns the n<sup>th</sup> number in the Fibonacci Sequence.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\n   nthFibo(4) == 2\n```\n```coffeescript\n   nthFibo(4) == 2\n```\n```ruby\n   nth_fibonacci(4) == 2\n```\n```haskell\n   fib 4 == 2\n```\n```lambdacalc\n   nth-fibo 4 == 2\n```\n```python\n   nth_fib(4) == 2\n```\n```csharp\n   NthFib(4) == 2\n```\n```c\n   nth_fib(4) == 2\n```\n```julia\n   nthfibo(4) == 2\n```\n```lua\n   nth_fib(4) == 2\n```\n```nasm\n    mov edi, 4\n    call nth_fib\n    cmp rax, 2 ; should be equal\n```\n\nBecause 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.\n\nFor reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are `0` and `1`, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.\n\n~~~if: lua\nNote: Since the 94th term of the sequence would cause an overflow in Lua, n will be between 0 and 93 (inclusive).\n~~~\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n#### Encodings\n\n`numEncoding: BinaryScott`\n~~~\n",
