  "description": "We have `employees` table with the the following columns:\n\n* `employee_id`: A unique integer identifier for each employee.\n* `full_name`: A string representing the employee's full name.\n* `team`: A string that specifies which team the employee is part of. The team can be one of the following four: \"backend\", \"frontend\", \"devops\", or \"design\".\n* `birth_date`: A date that represents the employee's birthdate.\n\nYour task is to write an SQL query that retrieves the complete record for 3-rd oldest developer in the backend team.  Let's assume for this task that there are no employees who share the same birthdate - tests are written to ensure that.\n\nLIMIT/FETCH as well as usage of window functions is forbidden. Can you come up with something more witty?\n\nGLHF! \n\n### Desired Output\n\nThe desired output should look like this:\n\n<table><!----><tr><th>employee_id</th><th>full_name</th><th>team</th><th>birth_date</th></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Madlyn Lowe</td><td>backend</td><td>1969-08-15</td></tr></table>\n\n",
