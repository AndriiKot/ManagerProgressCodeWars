  "description": "### Happy Holidays fellow Code Warriors!\nSanta just finished taking a data structures course, and thought it would be a great idea to build a Binary Christmas Tree! All of Santa's helpers created a Binary Christmas Tree, but not all of them meet his requirements. Can you write some code to validate the Binary Christmas Trees?\n\n### Valid Binary Christmas Tree\nWrite a function `isValidTree` that accepts a Binary Tree, and returns true if it meets Santa's requirements, false otherwise. Since the tree is a binary tree, each node can have 0, 1, or 2 children. The `left` and `right` properties can be used to access the current nodes left and right children. All nodes have an `ornament` property, which is the name of the ornament, and a `color` property, which  represents the color of the `ornament`.\n\n### Santa's Binary Christmas Tree Requirements\nA valid Binary Christmas Tree will meet the following requirements:\n<ul>\n<li>Root node has a 'star' ornament</li>\n<li>Nodes with zero children (excluding the root node) have a 'blue' colored ornament</li>\n<li>Nodes with one or two children (excluding the root node) have a 'red' colored ornament</li>\n</ul>\n\n### Examples:\n```javascript\nisValidTree( {\n  ornament: 'star', \n  color: 'yellow'\n} )// => returns true\n\nisValidTree( {\n  ornament: 'star',\n  color: 'yellow',\n  left: {\n    ornament: 'candy cane',\n    color: 'blue'\n  }\n} )// => returns true\n\nisValidTree( {\n  ornament: 'star',\n  color: 'yellow',\n  right: {\n    ornament: 'stocking',\n    color: 'red'\n  }\n} )// => returns false\n\n```",
