  "description": "Unscramble the eggs.\n\nThe string given to your function has had an \"egg\" inserted directly after each consonant. \nYou need to return the string before it became eggcoded.\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nunscrambleEggs(\"Beggegeggineggneggeregg\")  =>  \"Beginner\"\n//             \"B---eg---in---n---er---\"\n```\n\nKata is supposed to be for beginners to practice reggular eggspressions, so commenting would be appreciated.",
