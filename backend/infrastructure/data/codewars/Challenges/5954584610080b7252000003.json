  "description": "# Task\n\nSome people have long queues in front of the cash machine. Some people need to withdraw money. They are ordinary people; Some people want to steal other people's money, yes, they are thieves ;-) Some people are policemen. They are looking for thieves.\n\nGiven a `queue` in string format, like this: `\"X1X#2X#XX\"`. `#` represents the ordinary people; \"X\" represents the thief; `digit 1-9` represents the\npoliceman. The numerical value represents the police's watching range. For example, 1 means the police could see 1 people in front of him and 1 people in the back.\n\nAll the thieves in the line of sight of the police will be caught!\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of thieves who have been caught.\n\n\n# Example\n\nFor `queue = \"X1X#2X#XX\"`, the output should be `3`.\n```\nX1X#2X#XX\n^ ^  ^  <--- These 3 thieves will be caught!\n```\n\nFor `queue = \"X5X#3X###XXXX##1#X1X\"`, the output should be `5`.\n```\nX5X#3X###XXXX##1#X1X\n^ ^  ^           ^ ^ <--- These 5 thieves will be caught!\n```\n\nFor `queue = \"X#X1#X9XX\"`, the output should be `5`.\n```\nX#X1#X9XX\n^ ^  ^ ^^ <--- All thieves will be caught!\n```",
