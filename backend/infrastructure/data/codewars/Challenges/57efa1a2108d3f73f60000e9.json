  "description": "Today was a sad day. Having bought a new beard trimmer, I set it to the max setting and shaved away at my joyous beard. Stupidly, I hadnt checked just how long the max setting was, and now I look like Ive just started growing it!\n\nYour task, given a beard represented as an arrayof arrays, is to trim the beard as follows:\n\n['|', 'J', '|', '|'],<br>\n['|', '|', '|', 'J'],<br>\n['...', '...', '...', '...'];<br>\n\nTo trim the beard use the following rules:<br>\n\ntrim any curled hair --> replace 'J' with '|'\ntrim any hair from the chin (last array) --> replace '|' or 'J' with '...'\n\nAll sub arrays will be same length. Return the corrected array of arrays",
