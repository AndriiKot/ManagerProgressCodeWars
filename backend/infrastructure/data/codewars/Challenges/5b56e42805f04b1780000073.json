  "description": "You are given a array which contains sub-arrays. Each sub-array represents a \npoint in a (2d) cartesian coordinate system.\n\nCreate a function which returns the distance of the two points which are farthest apart.\n\nAll distances are to be rounded to 2 decimal places.\nIf the array contains two points return the distance between them. There will always be at least two points.\n\n\n```python\nfurthest_distance([[1,2], [3,8], [4,3]]) # returns 6.32\n```\n\nDistances between\n\n`[1,2] [3,8]` : `6.32`\n\n`[3,8] [4,3]` : `5.10`\n\n`[1,2] [4,3]` : `3.16`\n\nThis [link](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/distform.htm) may help if you don't know how to work out the distance between two points.",
