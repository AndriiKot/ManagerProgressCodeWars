  "description": "# Description\n\nYou can paint an asperand by pixels in three steps:\n1. First you paint the inner square, with a side of ```k```.\n2. Then you need to paint one pixel, that's laying diagonally relative to the inner square that you just painted ( _the bottom-right corner of the inner square is touching the top-left corner of the pixel_ ). Let's call it the \"bridge\".\n3. Finally, you will need to paint the outer shape, connected diagonally to the \"bridge\" ( _see the picture for more information_ ).\n\nHere are some examples of this:\n\n![Examples for 0<k<5](https://justpaste.it/img/78b363ec3c92b9be234603fd8ca0b1e4.png)\n\nYour task is to find the number of pixels that need to be painted, for different `k`:\n\n```javascript\nk = 1 => 11\nk = 2 => 18\nk = 3 => 26\nk = 4 => 34\n\n# Limitations are 1 ≤ k ≤ 1e9\n```\n\n_The idea for this kata was taken from the Ukrainian Informatics Olympiad 2023._",
