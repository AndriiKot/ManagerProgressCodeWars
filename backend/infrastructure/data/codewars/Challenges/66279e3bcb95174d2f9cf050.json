  "description": "In this challenge, you have to create two functions to convert an emoji string to the \"emojicode\" format, and back.\n\n**Emoji strings** consist solely of Unicode emojis, and each of the emojis can be represented with a single Unicode code point. There is no combining characters, variant selectors, joiners, direction modifiers, color modifiers, groups of people, or any other emojis which consist of more than a single code point.\n\n**Emojicode** string is a string of space separated code points of Unicode emojis. Every code point is formatted as its **decimal** value, stringified into a sequence of **Unicode emoji keycap digits**.\n\n\n### Examples\n\nThe emoji **\"SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES\"** 😊 is encoded as `U+1F60A`. The decimal value of its code point is `128522`. After converting the value to a string and using emoji keycaps for digits, the emojicode is `\"1️⃣2️⃣8️⃣5️⃣2️⃣2️⃣\"`. \n\nThe three emojis **SEE-/HEAR-/SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY** are represented by code points `U+1F648`, `U+1F649`, and `U+1F64A`, which are decimal `128584`, `128585` and `128586`, respectively. Therefore, the string `\"🙈🙉🙊\"` after conversion to emojicode results in `\"1️⃣2️⃣8️⃣5️⃣8️⃣4️⃣ 1️⃣2️⃣8️⃣5️⃣8️⃣5️⃣ 1️⃣2️⃣8️⃣5️⃣8️⃣6️⃣\"`.\n\n### Tests size\n\nAt the moment of the writing, Unicode Emoji Standard includes ~1380 emojis which can be represented with a single Unicode code point (see **References** below). Each of these emojis is tested at least once for conversion in both directions, with fixed tests. Additionally, small random tests check 50 strings of 1-5 emojis and 200 strings of 20-50 emojis, for conversion in both directions.\n\n### References\n\n[List of Unicode emojis](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html)",
