  "description": "We are interested in obtaining two scores from a given integer:\n\n**First score**: The sum of all the integers obtained from the power set of the digits of the given integer that have the same order \n\nE.g:\n```\ninteger = 1234 ---> (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) + (12 + 13 + 14 + 23 + 24 + 34) + \n(123 + 124 + 134 + 234) + 1234 = 10 + 120 + 615 + 1234 = 1979\n```\n**Second score**: The sum of all the integers obtained from the all the contiguous substrings of the given integer as a string.\n\nE.g.\n```\ninteger = 1234 ---> (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) + (12 + 23 + 34) + (123 + 234) + 1234 = 10 + 69 + 357 + 1234 = 1670\n```\nThe first integer, higher than ```100```, that has both scores with ```3``` common divisors is ```204```. Its first score is ```258``` and the second one ```234```. The common divisors for both scores are ```2, 3, 6```.\n\nIn fact the integers ```294``` and ```468``` are the ones in the range ```[100, 500]```, that have both scores with ```7``` common divisors, the maximum amount of common factors in that range.\n\nYour task in this kata is to create a function that may find the integer or integers that have the maximum amount of common divisors for the scores described above.\n\nThe example given above will be:\n```python\nfind_int_inrange(100, 500) == [7, 294, 468]\n```\nAs you can see, the function should receive the limits of a range [a, b], and outputs an array with the maximum amount of factors, ```max_am_div``` and the found numbers sorted\n```\nfind_int_inrange(a, b) ----> [max_am_div, k1, k2, ...., kn] # k1 < k2 < ...< kn\n```\nThe function may output only one number.\n```python\nfind_int_inrange(100, 300) == [7, 294]\n```\nEnjoy it!\n\nFeatures of the random tests:\n```\n100 < a < b < 55000 \n```\n",
