  "description": "I'm creating a scoreboard on my game website, but I want the score to be displayed as tally marks instead of Roman numerals. Write a function that translates the numeric score into tally marks.\n\nMy tally mark font uses the letters a, b, c, d, e to represent tally marks for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively. I want a space and line break (\n) after each completed tally (5).\n\nAssume that the score you receive will be an integer. This function should return an HTML string that I can insert into my website that represents the correct score.",
