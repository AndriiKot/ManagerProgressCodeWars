  "description": "Imagine you are in a universe where you can just perform the following arithematic operations:\n* Addition (`+`)\n* Subtraction (`-`)\n* Multiplication (`*`)\n* Integer Division (`/`)\n\nA postfix expression is an expression where the operands come after the operator. Operators and operands are separared by a space.\n\nWrite a function that takes a string representing a postfix expression as input and returns what it evaluates to as an integer.\n\n* You can assume that the input is always valid.\n* You can assume there will be no divisions by zero\n\n### Examples\n* `25 45 +` is equivalent to `25 + 45` --> `70`\n* `20 40 + 60 *` is equivalent to `(20 + 40) * 60` --> `3600`\n* `20 40 60 + *` is equivalent to `20 * (40 + 60)` --> `2000`\n* ",
