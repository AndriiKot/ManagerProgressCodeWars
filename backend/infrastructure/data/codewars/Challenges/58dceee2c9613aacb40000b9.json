  "description": "This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.\n\n`Point` objects have `x`, `y`,  and `z` attributes. For Haskell there are `Point` data types described with record syntax with fields `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n\nWrite a function calculating distance between `Point a` and `Point b`.",
