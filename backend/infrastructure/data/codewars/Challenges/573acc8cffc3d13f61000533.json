  "description": "Create a rigged dice function that 22% of the time returns the number 6. The rest of the time it returns the integers 1,2,3,4,5 uniformly.\n\n---\n\nAbout the test case\n\nThere will only be one test case which calls the throw_rigged function 100k times and checks that 6 is returned in the range of 21700-22300 (inclusive) times. The test does not check that 1-5 is returned uniformly or randomly, but it does check that your function returns integers in the range 1-6 (inclusive).\n\nThe test works roughly 98% of the time, so you might want to run it twice if you are confident your solution is correct.\n\n\n```if:javascript\nIn JS version, test for:\n- return value should between 1-6;\n- return value should be randomly;\n- run your code 100000 times should produce 21700-22300 numbers 6\n```\n\nGood Luck!\n",
