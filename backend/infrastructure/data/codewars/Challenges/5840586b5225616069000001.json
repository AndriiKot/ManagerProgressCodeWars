  "description": "You will be given two ASCII strings, `a` and `b`. Your task is write a function to determine which one of these strings is \"worth\" more, and return it.\n\nA string's worth is determined by the sum of its ASCII codepoint indexes. So, for example, the string `HELLO` has a value of 372: H is codepoint 72, E 69, L 76, and O is 79. The sum of these values is 372.\n\nIn the event of a tie, you should return the first string, i.e. `a`.",
