  "description": "#About Caesar Cipher\n\nCaesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique based on shifting each character by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.\n\nFor example, if the shift is 3, an encoded version of phrase \"kata\" will be:\n```\nk + 3 = n\na + 3 = d\nt + 3 = w\na + 3 = d\n```\nIn a case when \"z\" is reached, the algorithm wraps back to \"a\".\nExample: \"zen\", key 3\n```\nz + 3 = c\ne + 3 = h\nn + 3 = q\n```\nThe key for this cipher can be any non-negative integer. However, because there are 26 letters in English alphabet, any key larger than 26 can be thought about as key = key % 26.\n\n#What to do\n\nYour task is to write a function that will *encrypt* a phrase using Caesar Cipher and a given shift key and return it as a string. However, **the key should be increased by 1 with every word in a phrase**. For example, if the function is called with a phrase \"divide et impera\" and key 3, the encoding should be as follows:\n```\n- Shift the word \"divide\" by the key of 3\n- Shift the word \"et\" by the key of 3 + 1 = 4\n- Shift the word \"impera\" by the key of 3 + 2 = 5\n```\n\n\n#Important things to note:\n- Guaranteed input will be of type string, **lowercase characters and spaces only**.\n- Key can be any non-negative integer.\n\nTo read more about Caesar Cipher, visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher",
