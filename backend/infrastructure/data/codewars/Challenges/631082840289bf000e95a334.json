  "description": "We have a positive integer ```N, N > 0```.\n\nWe have a special integer ```N1, N1 > N```, such that \n```N1 = c ‧ d``` and ```N = c + d``` with the constraint that ```c ≠ d```\n\nLet´s see an example:\n```\nN = 26 (starting integer)\n```\nThe next integer ```N1```, chained with this property  with ```N```, will be ```48```.\n\nBecause:\n```\nN1 = 2 x 24 = 48\nN = 2 + 24 = 26\n```\nBut there are another integers chained with ```N``` with the property shown above. In effect the next integer ```N2 = 69```\n\nLet´s see:\n```\nN2 = 3 x 23 = 69\nN = 3 + 23 = 26\n```\nThe next integer ```N3``` is ```88``` and you may figure out the values for ```c``` and ```d```.\n\nIf we continue working trying to find the successive values of ```Ni``` for our starting integer ```N = 26``` we will find the following chain.\n```\n26 (N) --> 48 (N1) --> 69 (N2) --> 88 (N3) --> ........... --> 160 (N9) --> 165 (N10) --> 168 (N11)\n```\nYou may work to obtain the intermediate values of the above incomplete chain for the starting integer```26```\n\nIn the example above ```169``` is discarded as a solution, because as we said before ```c``` and ```d``` should be different.\n\nThe task for this exercise is the following:\n\n*Given a starting integer you have to find the maximum chained integer that fulfills the property explained above*\n\nYour code should output an integer in all cases.\nYou will receive always an integer as an input.\n\nSpecial Cases\n\n* If your starting integer is less than ```5```, we do not have a result higher than your starting integer. In those cases your code should output ```-1```. As an example:\n\n```\ninput:4; output:-1\n```\nYou will see more examples in the fixed examples of the sample box.\nYou have to pass 200 random tests and the values for the starting ```N``` are in the following range:\n```c\n1000 < N < 1 * 10^9\n```\n```cpp\n1000 < N < 1 * 10^9\n```\n```js\n10 < N < 1 x 10^14\n```\n```cobol\n10 < N < 1 x 10^14\n```\n```csharp\n10 < N < 1 x 10^9\n```\n```java\n10 < N < 1 x 10^9\n```\n```python\n10 < N < 1 x 10^14\n```\n```ruby\n10 < N < 1 x 10^14\n```\n```typescript\n10 < N < 1 x 10^14\n```\n\nI hope that this challenge will be useful for all the coding lovers.\n\nSpecial Acknowledgements for two Codewarriors: Unnamed and macambira for their observations done in the beta phase.",
