  "description": "We need a function that receives two arrays, each of them with elements that occur only once. We need to know:\n*  Number of elements that are present in both arrays\n* Number of elements that are present in only one array\n* Number of remaining elements in `arr1` after extracting the elements  of `arr2`\n* Number of remaining elements in `arr2` after extracting the elements  of `arr1`\n\n\n## Example\n\n```\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\narr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]\n```\n\n The result is: `[4, 8, 5, 3]`\n\n* `4` elements present in both arrays: 2, 4, 6, 8\n* `8` elements present in only one array: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14\n* `5` elements remaning in `arr1`: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\n* `3` elements remaning in `arr2`: 10, 12, 14\n\nNo doubt, an easy kata to warm up before doing the more complex ones.\nEnjoy it!\n\n\n\n",
