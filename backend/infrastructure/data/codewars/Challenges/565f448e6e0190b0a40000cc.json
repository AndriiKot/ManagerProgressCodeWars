  "description": "[XKCD 1609]( http://xkcd.com/1609/) provides us with the following fun fact:\n\n![If anyone tries this on you, the best reply is a deadpan \"Oh yeah, that's a common potato chip flavor in Canada.\"](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/food_combinations.png)\n\n### Task:\n\nGiven an array containing a list of good foods, return a string containing the assertion that any two of the individually good foods are really good when combined.\n\neg: `\"You know what's actually really good? Pancakes and relish.\"`\n\n\n### Examples:\n```ruby\nGood_foods = [\"Ice cream\", \"Ham\", \"Relish\", \"Pancakes\", \"Ketchup\", \"Cheese\", \"Eggs\", \"Cupcakes\", \"Sour cream\", \"Hot chocolate\", \"Avocado\", \"Skittles\"]\n\nactually_really_good( Good_foods ) #  \"You know what's actually really good? Pancakes and relish.\"\n\nactually_really_good( ['Peanut butter'] ) #  \"You know what's actually really good? Peanut butter and more peanut butter.\"\n\nactually_really_good( [] ) #  \"You know what's actually really good? Nothing!\"\n\n```\n```javascript\nGood_foods = [\"Ice cream\", \"Ham\", \"Relish\", \"Pancakes\", \"Ketchup\", \"Cheese\", \"Eggs\", \"Cupcakes\", \"Sour cream\", \"Hot chocolate\", \"Avocado\", \"Skittles\"]\n\nactuallyReallyGood( Good_foods ) #  \"You know what's actually really good? Pancakes and relish.\"\n\nactuallyReallyGood( ['Peanut butter'] ) #  \"You know what's actually really good? Peanut butter and more peanut butter.\"\n\nactuallyReallyGood( [] ) #  \"You know what's actually really good? Nothing!\"\n```\n```python\nGood_foods = [\"Ice cream\", \"Ham\", \"Relish\", \"Pancakes\", \"Ketchup\", \"Cheese\", \"Eggs\", \"Cupcakes\", \"Sour cream\", \"Hot chocolate\", \"Avocado\", \"Skittles\"]\n\nactually_really_good( Good_foods ) #  \"You know what's actually really good? Pancakes and relish.\"\n\nactually_really_good( ['Peanut butter'] ) #  \"You know what's actually really good? Peanut butter and more peanut butter.\"\n\nactually_really_good( [] ) #  \"You know what's actually really good? Nothing!\"\n```\n\n### Notes:\nThere are many different valid combinations of 2 foods it doesn't matter which one you choose.  \nBut there should be 2 different foods listed **unless** there was only one food given in the input array.   \nCapitalization should be correct, the first given food should be capitalized, but the second should not.   \nThe input array should not be modified by the method.   \n\nThe test cases for this kata are fairly complicated, see if you can trick them. (Then let me know about it in the discourse.)   \n\nThe original kata language is *Ruby*\n\n### Bonus:\nIf you thought this kata was easy, try this one: [Testing 'Food combinations'](http://www.codewars.com/kata/testing-food-combinations) in which you get to write a method similar to the one the tests here use to check that a result is valid and returns any errors it has.\n",
