  "description": "For the numbers 1 to 1000, there are 1000 numbers that are evenly divided by the number 1, 500 numbers in that range that divide evenly by 2, and so forth.\n\n~~~if:cobol\nGiven a and b, your function should return a table of tuples which first elements are the numbers from 1 to b, and the second are the amount of numbers from 1 to a that can be divided by the key. The order of the tuples in the table doesn't matter.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\na = 1000, b = 25\n# should return [[1, 1000], [2: 500], ... [25, ?]]\n```\n~~~\n~~~if-not:cobol\nGiven a and b, your function should return a hash where they keys are the numbers from 1 to b, and the values are the amount of numbers from 1 to a that can be divided by the key.\nFor example:\n\n```\na = 1000, b = 25\n# should return { 1: 1000, 2: 500, ... 25: ? }\n```\n~~~\n",
