  "description": "A **prime number** (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nYou will be given the `lower` and `upper` limits: the program will look for any prime number that exists between the lower limit to the upper limit (included).\n\nYour objective is to sum all the primes between the given limits.\n* If the limits are primes, then they are included\n* -100000 <= `lower` < `upper` <= 100000\n* If `lower` is greater than `upper`, it should return `0`\n\n\n### Example\nYou are given a lower limit of `4` and an upper limit of `20`.\n\nSo the prime numbers from 4 to 20 will be: \n```5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19```\n\nand if you add them up, the result will be `72`.\n\n```python\nsum_primes(4, 20) = 72  # 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 = 72\n\nsum_primes(20, 4) = 0  # since lower is greater than upper\n\nsum_primes(2, 7) = 17  # 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17\n\nsum_primes(11, 11) = 11  # it consists of one prime number\n\nsum_primes(60, 60) = 0  # since 60 is not a prime number\n```",
