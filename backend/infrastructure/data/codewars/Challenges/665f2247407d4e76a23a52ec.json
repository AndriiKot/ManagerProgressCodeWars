  "description": "**<ins>Introduction</ins>**  \nIn certain games, you are tasked with creating a shape consisting of horizontally or vertically (not diagonally) adjacent same-valued cells by placing elements into a grid.  \n\n\n**<ins>Objective</ins>**  \nIn this Kata your objective is to, given a randomly sized rectangular grid populated with elements, **find the largest such shape and return its size**\n\nFor example, the following grid:\n```python\n[[1, 1, 1, 2],\n [1, 2, 1, 3],\n [2, 1, 3, 3]]\n```\nHas a 5-sized shape of cells of value ```1``` with coordinates ```(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2)``` in the format (row, column), and contains no larger shapes, and hence should return ```5```\n\n\n\n**<ins>Features of random tests:</ins>**  \n\n- The numbers of *rows and columns* in grid will always be inbetween ```4``` and ```20``` (inclusive)\n- every cell in the grid will always be *populated by positive integers* between ```1``` and ```5```  \n\n\n*Some further examples:*\n```python\n #The Following Grid\n[[1, 2, 1, 1, 2],\n [2, 2, 1, 3, 3],\n [3, 3, 4, 1, 1],\n [1, 4, 3, 2, 2]]\n #Should Return\n3\n\n #The Following Grid\n[[1, 2, 1],\n [1, 3, 1]]\n #Should Return\n2\n```",
