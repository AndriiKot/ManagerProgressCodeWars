  "description": "When we have a 2x2 square matrix we may have up to 24 different ones changing the positions of the elements.\n\nWe show some of them\n```\na  b   a  b    a  c    a  c   a  d    a  d    b  a    b  a\nc  d   d  c    d  b    b  d   b  c    c  b    c  d    d  c\n```\nYou may think to generate the remaining ones until completing the set of 24 matrices.\n\nGiven a certain matrix of numbers, that may be repeated or not, calculate the total number of possible matrices that may be generated, changing the position of the elements.\n\nE.g:\nCase one\n```\nA = [[1,2,3],\n     [3,4,5]]   #a 2x3 rectangle matrix with number 3 twice\n```     \ngenerates a set of ```360``` different matrices\n\nCase two\n```\nA = [[1,1,1], \n     [2,2,3], \n     [3,3,3]]\n```\ngenerates a set of ```1260``` different matrices.\n\nCase three\n```\nA = [[1,2,3],\n     [4,5,6],\n     [7,8,9]]\n```     \ngenerates a set of ```362880``` different matrices\n\nThis kata is not meant to apply a brute force algorithm to try to count the total amount of marices.\n\nFeatures of The Random Tests\n``` \nnumber of tests = 100\n2 ≤ m ≤ 9\n2 ≤ n ≤ 9\n``` \nEnjoy it!\n\nAvailable only in Python 2, Javascript and Ruby by the moment.",
