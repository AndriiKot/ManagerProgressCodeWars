  "description": "A happy number is a number defined by the following process: starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.\n\nThose numbers for which this process ends in 1 are **happy numbers**, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers) (Wikipedia).\n\nWrite a function that takes `n` as parameter and return `true` if and only if `n` is an happy number, `false` otherwise.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nFor example number `7` is happy because after a number of steps the computed sequence ends up with a 1: `7, 49, 97, 130, 10, 1 `\n\nWhile `3` is not, and would give us an infinite sequence: `3, 9, 81, 65, 61, 37, 58, 89, 145, 42, 20, 4, 16, 37, 58, 89, 145, 42, 20, 4, 16, 37, ...`\n\n\nHappy coding!\n",
