  "description": "Given a certain number, how many multiples of three could you obtain with its digits?\n\nSuposse that you have the number 362. The numbers that can be generated from it are:\n\n```\n362 ----> 3, 6, 2, 36, 63, 62, 26, 32, 23, 236, 263, 326, 362, 623, 632 \n```\n\nBut only ```3, 6, 36, 63``` are multiple of three.\n\n\nWe need a function that can receive a number and may output in the following order:\n\n- the amount of multiples\n\n- the maximum multiple\n\n\nLet's see a case the number has a the digit 0 and repeated digits:\n\n```\n6063 ----> 0, 3, 6, 30, 36, 60, 63, 66, 306, 360, 366, 603, 606, 630, 636, 660, 663, 3066, 3606, 3660, 6036, 6063, 6306, 6360, 6603, 6630\n```\n\nIn this case the multiples of three will be all except 0\n\n```\n6063 ----> 3, 6, 30, 36, 60, 63, 66, 306, 360, 366, 603, 606, 630, 636, 660, 663, 3066, 3606, 3660, 6036, 6063, 6306, 6360, 6603, 6630\n```\n\nSo the expected result given the above cases:\n\n```\nGiven 362, should return [4, 63]\n(amount of multiples = 4, maximum multiple = 63)\n\nGiven 6063, should return [25, 6630]\n(amount of multiples = 25, maximum multiple = 6630)\n```\n\nThe function will receive only positive integers (num > 0), and you don't have to worry for validating the entries.\n\nFeatures of the random tests:\n\n```\nNumber of test = 100\n1000 ≤ num ≤ 100000000\n```\n\nEnjoy it!!\n\n",
