  "description": "Is there enough ink for printing the image?\n\nYou will get an image and the level of ink for each primary color in the tank of the printer. The image is a matrix where each cell is the color of a pixel. The color is a string of a RGB hexadecimal notation (e.g white is `'ffffff'` and black is `'000000'`). Each primary color is a integer.\n\nA pixel with the color code `'fefdfc'` need 1 unit of Red, 2 units of Green and 3 units of Blue.\n\nA pixel with the color code `'00ff01'` need 255 units of Red, 0 units of Green and 254 units of Blue.\n\nThe image is two dimensional. E.g: image = `[[\"ffffff\", \"ffffff\"], [\"ffffff\", \"ffffff\"]]`\n\nYour task is to determine if they are enough ink in the tank to print the image.\n\nIf the ink is enough, the function should return True. False otherwise.\n\nHave fun!",
