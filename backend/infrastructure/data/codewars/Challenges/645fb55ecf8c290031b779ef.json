  "description": "A **latin square** is an n × n array filled with the integers 1 to n, each occurring once in each row and column.\n\nHere are examples of latin squares of size 4 and 7:\n```\n[[1, 4, 3, 2],      [[2, 3, 1, 7, 4, 6, 5], \n [4, 3, 2, 1],       [7, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4, 3], \n [3, 2, 1, 4],       [6, 7, 5, 4, 1, 3, 2], \n [2, 1, 4, 3]]       [4, 5, 3, 2, 6, 1, 7], \n                     [5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 2, 1], \n                     [1, 2, 7, 6, 3, 5, 4], \n                     [3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 7, 6]]\n```\n\nLatin squares have many practical uses, for example in error-correcting-codes and the design of agricultural experiments. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square for more details. Sudoku is a special type of 9 x 9 latin square, with additional conditions.\n\nTask: Write a function that returns a latin square for any positive integer n.\n\nYou might also enjoy [Latin Square Validator](https://www.codewars.com/kata/646254375cee7a000ffaa404) and [Euler Squares](https://www.codewars.com/kata/6470e15f4f0b26052c6151cd).\n",
