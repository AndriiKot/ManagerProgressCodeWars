  "description": "Your task is to write a function that does just what the title suggests (so, fair warning, be aware that you are not getting out of it just throwing a lame basic sorting method there) with a list of integers and the expected number `n` of smallest elements to return.\n\nAlso:\n\n* the number of elements to be returned cannot be higher than the list length;\n* elements can be duplicated;\n* in case of duplicates, just return them according to the original order (see third example for more clarity).\n\nSame examples and more in the test cases:\n\n| Array              |  N  | Expected\n| ------------------ | :-- | ----------\n| `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  | `3` | `[1, 2, 3]`\n| `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`  | `3` | `[3, 2, 1]`\n| `[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`  | `3` | `[1, 2, 1]`\n| `[1, 2, 3, -4, 0]` | `3` | `[1, -4, 0]`\n| `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  | `0` | `[]`\n\n[Performance version by FArekkusu](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5aeed69804a92621a7000077) also available.",
