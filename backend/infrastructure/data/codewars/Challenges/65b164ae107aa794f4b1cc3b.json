  "description": "## Debounce Function Overview\n\nThe `debounce` function is designed to enhance performance by controlling the frequency of function executions. It takes two parameters:\n\n1. **func**: The target function whose invocation frequency is to be optimized using the debounce technique. This function can accept any number of arguments.\n2. **delay**: Specifies the minimum time interval (in milliseconds) required between consecutive invocations of the function.\n\n### Functionality of Debounce\n\n- Returns a debounced variant of the provided function.\n- The debounced function, when invoked, will execute only if the time elapsed since the last call is greater than the specified delay.\n- Ensures that the original function's arguments and context (`this` value) are preserved and passed correctly when it is executed.\n",
