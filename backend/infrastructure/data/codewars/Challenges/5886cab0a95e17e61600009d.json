  "description": "# Task\n Let's call two integers A and B friends if each integer from the array divisors is either a divisor of both A and B or neither A nor B. If two integers are friends, they are said to be in the same clan. How many clans are the integers from 1 to k, inclusive, broken into?\n\n# Example\n\n For `divisors = [2, 3] and k = 6`, the output should be `4`\n\n The numbers 1 and 5 are friends and form a clan, 2 and 4 are friends and form a clan, and 3 and 6 do not have friends and each is a clan by itself. So the numbers 1 through 6 are broken into 4 clans.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer array `divisors`\n\n    A non-empty array of positive integers.\n\n    Constraints: `2 ≤ divisors.length < 10, 1 ≤ divisors[i] ≤ 10`.\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `k`\n\n    A positive integer.\n\n    Constraints: `5 ≤ k ≤ 50`.\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer",
