  "description": "The word `i18n` is a common abbreviation of `internationalization` in the developer community, used instead of typing the whole word and trying to spell it correctly. Similarly, `a11y` is an abbreviation of `accessibility`.\n\nWrite a function that takes a string and turns any and all \"words\" (see below) within that string of **length 4 or greater** into an abbreviation, following these rules:\n\n* A \"word\" is a sequence of alphabetical characters. By this definition, any other character like a space or hyphen (eg. \"elephant-ride\") will split up a series of letters into two words (eg. \"elephant\" and \"ride\").\n* The abbreviated version of the word should have the first letter, then the number of removed characters, then the last letter (eg. \"elephant ride\" => \"e6t r2e\").\n\n## Example\n\n```\n input: \"elephant-rides are really fun!\"\n          ^^^^^^^^*^^^^^*^^^*^^^^^^*^^^*\n words (^):   \"elephant\" \"rides\" \"are\" \"really\" \"fun\"\n                123456     123     1     1234     1\n ignore short words:               X              X\n\n abbreviate:    \"e6t\"     \"r3s\"  \"are\"  \"r4y\"   \"fun\"\n all non-word characters (*) remain in place\n                     \"-\"      \" \"    \" \"     \" \"     \"!\"\noutput: \"e6t-r3s are r4y fun!\"\n```",
