  "description": "# Sentence Smash\n\nWrite a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. **Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!**\n\n## Example\n\n```\n['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'\n```\n\n## Assumptions\n\n* You can assume that you are only given words.\n* You cannot assume the size of the array.\n* You can assume that you do get an array.\n\n## What We're Testing\n\nWe're testing basic loops and string manipulation. This is for beginners who are just learning loops and string manipulation.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis is for beginners so we want to test basic loops and string manipulation. Advanced users should easily be able to do this in one line.\n",
