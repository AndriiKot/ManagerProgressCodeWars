  "description": "You decided to sit down and make a nice simple program, little did you know your little sister has removed both of the shift buttons and the caps lock from your keyboard.\n\nIn other words:\nIn this this Kata you need to make your program without any capital letters or square brackets [].\n\nWhy no square brackets you ask?\n\nI don't know I felt like it ㄟ(o-o)ㄏ\n\n(In order to prevent cheating, \\ is not allowed either)\n\nThe program is simple, you only need to have three functions (you can have more if you want):\n\n**add**\n\n  Add should be able to get any of the following: int, char, float, double, boolean, String.\n  \n  If the input is an int it should store that number, oterwise just dont crash...\n  \n**avg**\n\n  Avg should return the average of all of the ints recived so far and then remove them all.\n  \n  Avg should return an int.\n  \n  Avg will never be called befor a valid int was added.\n  \n**get_amount_of**\n\n  Get_amount_of should return the amount of times the given number was entered \n   \n  Keep in mind that numbers are erased after avg and shouldn't be counted\n  \n\nThat's it! Have fun!",
