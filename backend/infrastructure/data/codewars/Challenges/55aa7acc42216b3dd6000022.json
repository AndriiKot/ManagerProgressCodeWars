  "description": "To pass the series of gates guarded by the owls, Kenneth needs to present them each with a highly realistic portrait of one.  Unfortunately, he is absolutely rubbish at drawing, and needs some code to return a brand new portrait with a moment's notice.\n\nAll owl heads look like this:\n\n    ''0v0''\n\nSuch beautiful eyes!\nHowever, they differ in their plumage, which is always symmetrical, eg.:\n\n       VVHVAV''0v0''VAVHVV\n\nor\n \n    YYAYAH8XH''0v0''HX8HAYAYY\n\nSo Kenneth needs a method that will take a garble of text generated by mashing at his keyboard (numbers and letters, but he knows how to avoid punctuation etc.) for a bit and give him a symmetrical owl with a lovely little face, with a truly symmetrical plumage made of uppercase letters and numbers.\n\n(To be clear, the acceptable characters for the plumage are 8,W,T,Y,U,I,O,A,H,X,V and M.)",
