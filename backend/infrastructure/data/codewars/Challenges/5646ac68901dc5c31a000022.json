  "description": "Given a certain integer ```n```, we need a function ```big_primefac_div()```, that give an array with the highest prime factor and the highest divisor (not equal to n).\n\nLet's see some cases:\n```python\nbig_primefac_div(100) == [5, 50]\nbig_primefac_div(1969) == [179, 179]\n```\nIf n is a prime number the function will output an empty list:\n```python\nbig_primefac_div(997) == []\n```\nIf ```n``` is an negative integer number, it should be considered the division with the absolute number of the value.\n```python\nbig_primefac_div(-1800) == [5, 900]\n```\n~~~if:javascript,python,ruby,julia\nIf ```n``` is a float type, will be rejected if it has a decimal part with some digits different than 0. The output \"The number has a decimal part. No Results\". But  ```n ``` will be converted automatically to an integer if all the digits of the decimal part are 0.\n\n```python\nbig_primefac_div(-1800.00) == [5, 900]\nbig_primefac_div(-1800.1) == \"The number has a decimal part. No Results\"\n```\n~~~\nOptimization and fast algorithms are a key factor to solve this kata.\nHappy coding and enjoy it!",
