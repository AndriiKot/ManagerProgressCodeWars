  "description": "The borrowers are tiny tiny fictional people. As tiny tiny people they have to be sure they aren't spotted, or more importantly, stepped on. \n\nAs a result, the borrowers talk very very quietly. They find that `capitals and punctuation` of any sort lead them to raise their voices and put them in danger. \n\nThe young borrowers have begged their parents to `stop using caps and punctuation`.\n\nChange the input text `s` to new borrower speak. Help save the next generation!",
