  "description": "Traditionally in FizzBuzz, multiples of 3 are replaced by \"Fizz\" and multiples of 5 are replaced by \"Buzz\". But we could also play FizzBuzz with any other integer pair `[n, m]` whose multiples are replaced with Fizz and Buzz. \n\nFor a sequence of numbers, Fizzes, Buzzes and FizzBuzzes, find the numbers whose multiples are being replaced by Fizz and Buzz. Return them as an array `[n, m]`\n\nThe Fizz and Buzz numbers will always be integers between 1 and 50, and the sequence will have a maximum length of 100. The Fizz and Buzz numbers might be equal, and might be equal to 1.\n\n## Examples\n* Classic FizzBuzz; multiples of 3 are replaced by Fizz, multiples of 5 are replaced by Buzz:\n```\n[1, 2, \"Fizz\", 4, \"Buzz\", 6]  ==>  [3, 5] \n```\n* Multiples of 2 are replaced by Fizz, multiples of 3 are replaced by Buzz:\n```\n[1, \"Fizz\", \"Buzz\", \"Fizz\", 5, \"FizzBuzz\"]  ==>  [2, 3]\n```\n* Multiples of 2 are replaced by Fizz and Buzz:\n```\n[1, \"FizzBuzz\", 3, \"FizzBuzz\", 5, \"FizzBuzz\"]  ==>  [2, 2]\n```\n* Fizz = 1, Buzz = 6:\n```\n[\"Fizz\", \"Fizz\", \"Fizz\", \"Fizz\", \"Fizz\", \"FizzBuzz\"]  ==>  [1, 6]\n```",
