  "description": "The [half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life) of a radioactive substance is the time it takes (on average) for one-half of its atoms to undergo radioactive decay.\n\n# Task Overview\nGiven the initial quantity of a radioactive substance, the quantity remaining after a given period of time, and the period of time, return the half life of that substance. \n\n# Usage Examples\n\n```\nInitial quantity: 10\nRemaining quantity: 5\nPeriod of time: 1\nHalf life --> 1.0\n(if quantity halves in 1 time period, half-life = 1)\n\nInitial quantity: 8\nRemaining quantity: 4\nPeriod of time: 2\nHalf life --> 2.0\n(if quantity halves in 2 time periods, half-life = 2)\n\nInitial quantity: 12\nRemaining quantity: 3\nPeriod of time: 2\nHalf life --> 1.0\n(if quantity is one-quarter after 2 time periods, half-life = 1)\n```",
