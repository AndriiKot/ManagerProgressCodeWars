  "description": "A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of symbols or elements, whose meaning may be interpreted the same way in either forward or reverse direction. Famous examples include \"Amore, Roma\", \"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\" and \"No 'x' in 'Nixon'\". - wikipedia\n\nOur goal is to determine whether or not a given string is a valid palindrome or not.\n\nLike the above examples, here are a few test cases which are also populated: \n\n    \"Amore, Roma\" => valid\n    \"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\" => valid\n    \"No 'x' in 'Nixon'\" => valid\n    \"Abba Zabba, you're my only friend\" => invalid\n\nYou can see that they are case insensitive and disregards non alphanumeric characters. In addition to a few predefined tests, your function will also be tested against a random string generator 50 times.\n\n**Notes**: \n\nThe empty string `\"\"` can be read forward or backward the same, it's a palindrome in our case.\n",
