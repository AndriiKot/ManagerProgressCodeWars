  "description": "Given an array of numbers, sort them in such a manner that all the odd numbers in the array are sorted in ascending order and the even numbers are sorted in descending order after the last odd number. For example\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] produces the output [1,3,5,7,9,8,6,4,2]. If the array contains decimals, round them down while checking for odd/even. The output must have the original numbers!\n\n`If there are no issues with the kata and you successfully completed it, please rank and upvote!`",
