  "description": "You are sending out a marketing campaign for your company, Code-o-matic. But you want to personalise the emails so that the people don't think they are being spammed!\n\nYou will be given a string of marketing text called `campaign` and a hash `person`. \n\nIn the string `campaign`, there will be three personalisable elements \n- `<NAME>`\n- `<CITY>`\n- `<FAVOURITE PRODUCTS>`.\n\nYou need to replace these elements with the personal details of the person to whom you are sending the email which are in the hash `person` (which may contain other information from the database, which you don't need).\n\nExamples:\n\nYou will be given this string called `campaign`:\n\n> \"Hello <NAME>, how is the weather in <CITY> today? We wanted to let you know that <FAVOURITE PRODUCTS> are on sale today only!\"\n\nYou will be given this hash:\n```ruby\nperson = {:name => \"Sally\", :city => \"Glasgow\", :favourite_product => \"toasters\"}.\n```\n```javascript\nperson = { name : \"Sally\", city : \"Glasgow\", favourite_products : \"toasters\"}.\n```\n\nYou should return this string:\n\n> \"Hello Sally, how is the weather in Glasgow today? We wanted to let you know that toasters are on sale today only!\"\n\nNote that the hash keys do not exactly match the tags, but there is a one to one mapping between them. \n\n```\n\n~~~ if:ruby\n\n| Tag | Key|\n|----------|\n| `<NAME>` | `:name`|\n| `<CITY>` | `:city`|\n| `<FAVOURITE PRODUCTS>` | `:favourite_product`|\n~~~\n\n~~~ if:javascript\n\n| Tag | Key|\n|----------|\n| `<NAME>` | `name`|\n| `<CITY>` | `city`|\n| `<FAVOURITE PRODUCTS>` | `favourite_products`|\n~~~\n\n",
