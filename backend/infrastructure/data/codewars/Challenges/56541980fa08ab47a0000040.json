  "description": "In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes\nthe printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity,\nare named with letters from `a to m`. \n\nThe colors used by the printer are\nrecorded in a control string. For example a \"good\" control string would be\n`aaabbbbhaijjjm` meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times\ncolor b, one time color h then one time color a...\n\nSometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a \"bad\" \ncontrol string is produced e.g. `aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm` with letters not from `a to m`.\n\nYou have to write a function `printer_error` which given a string will return\nthe error rate of the printer as a **string** representing a rational whose numerator \nis the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string.\nDon't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.\n\nThe string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters \nfrom `a`to `z`.\n\n#### Examples:\n\n```\ns=\"aaabbbbhaijjjm\"\nprinter_error(s) => \"0/14\"\n\ns=\"aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm\"\nprinter_error(s) => \"8/22\"\n\n```",
