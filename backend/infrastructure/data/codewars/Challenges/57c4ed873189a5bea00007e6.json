  "description": "We need to encode a message.\n\nOnly alpha characters will be encoded.  Non-alpha characters will be copied.  So, the message \" 0123. \" would be encoded to \" 0123. \".\n\nFor alpha characters, we will follow these rulse:\n\n    1.  All alpha characters will be treated as upper case\n    2.  The first alpha character will not change (except for switching to upper case).\n    3.  All subsequent alpha characters will be shifted toward 'Z' by the \n        alphabetical position of the previous alpha character.  \n        (wrap back to 'A' if 'Z' is passed)\n    \n\nFor example:  \"He1lo\" would be encoded as follows:\n\n    H -> H (first alpha character does not change)\n    e -> M (H is the previous alpha character, and is the 8th letter in the alphabet.  E + 8 = M)\n    1 -> 1 (non alpha characters do not change)\n    l -> Q (E is the previous alpha character, and is the 5th letter in the alphabet.  L + 5 = Q)\n    o -> A (L is the previous alpha character, and is the 12th letter in the alphabet.  O + 12 = A)\n    \nSo, \"He1lo\" would be encoded to \"HM1QA\"\n\nWrite two functions.  One to encode and one to decode. (Decoding \"HM1QA\" should yield \"HE1LO\")\n\nFor both functions, empty strings and null strings should return empty strings.",
