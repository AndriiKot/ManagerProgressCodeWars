  "description": "In this kata you have to write a method that folds a given array of integers by the middle x-times.\n\nAn example says more than thousand words:\n```\nFold 1-times:\n[1,2,3,4,5] -> [6,6,3]\n\nA little visualization (NOT for the algorithm but for the idea of folding):\n\n Step 1         Step 2        Step 3       Step 4       Step5\n                     5/           5|         5\\          \n                    4/            4|          4\\      \n1 2 3 4 5      1 2 3/         1 2 3|       1 2 3\\       6 6 3\n----*----      ----*          ----*        ----*        ----*\n\n\nFold 2-times:\n[1,2,3,4,5] -> [9,6]\n```\n\nAs you see, if the count of numbers is odd, the middle number will stay. Otherwise the fold-point is between the middle-numbers, so all numbers would be added in a way.\n\nThe array will always contain numbers and will never be null. The parameter runs will always be a positive integer greater than 0 and says how many runs of folding your method has to do.\n\nIf an array with one element is folded, it stays as the same array.\n\nThe input array should not be modified!\n\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) \n\nI have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.",
