  "description": "You're a kata author trying to prevent code warriors from using Ruby's built in random number generators because you want them to implement their own.\n\nPrevent the usage of random number generators by preventing calls to ```rand``` and ```srand``` in both the Kernel module and the Random class. Also prevent sneaky types from using ```sample``` and ```shuffle``` on arrays to get random numbers.\n\nThe test will require calls to these methods to throw an error.\n\nExtra points for discussion about ways to call random even after running solutions which pass the test.",
