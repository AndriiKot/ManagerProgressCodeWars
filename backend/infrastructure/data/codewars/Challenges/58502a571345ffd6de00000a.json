  "description": "In this Kata you have to sort through a pile of clothes and find your grandfathers pants. You have to wash the ones that don't smell fresh and store the fresh ones in the closet.\n\nEach piece of clothing will belong to a person. You have to call the wash() method on all the dirty grandpa's pants and store() on the clean ones. Any smell other than 'Fresh' will be considered to be dirty. Ignore any clothes that are not pants worn by your grandpa. For example, don't touch your grandpa's socks, no matter if they are clean or not.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> wash() and store() methods modify the inStorage and inWashing properties of the Clothes class. If you want, you can modify these directly.",
