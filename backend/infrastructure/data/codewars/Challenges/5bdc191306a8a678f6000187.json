  "description": "You are given two strings. In a single move, you can choose any of them, and delete the first (i.e. leftmost) character.\n\nFor Example:\n\n* By applying a move to the string `\"where\"`, the result is the string `\"here\"`.\n* By applying a move to the string `\"a\"`, the result is an empty string `\"\"`.\n\nImplement a function that calculates the minimum number of moves that should be performed to make the given strings equal.\n\n## Notes\n\n* Both strings consist of lowercase latin letters.\n* If the string is already empty, you cannot perform any more delete operations.",
