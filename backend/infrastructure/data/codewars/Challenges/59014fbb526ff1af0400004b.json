  "description": "### Task\n\nYou're given a `sentence`, where each word has different length. Swap the longest word with the shortest one, the 2nd shortest word with the 2nd longest one, and so on.\n\nNote that the resulting sentence should be correct, i.e. it should be capitalized and all words but the first one should contain only lowercase letters (except the word `\"I\"`).\n\n### Input/Output\n\n\n- `[input]` string `sentence`  \n  A non-empty string of English letters and whitespace characters.  \n  The words are separated by a single space character and there are no leading or trailing spaces.\n\n\n- `[output]` a string  \n  Correct sentence with words replaced. It should be capitalized and all words but the first one should contain only lowercase letters (except the word `\"I\"`).\n\n### Examples\n\nFor `sentence = \"I am the best\"`, the output should be `\"Best the am I\"`\n \nThe word `\"I\"` and word `\"best\"` exchanged their positions; The word `\"am\"` and word `\"the\"` exchanged their positions.\n \nFor `sentence = \"I am better than him\"`, the output should be `\"Better than I am him\"`\n \nThe word `\"I\"` and word `\"better\"` exchanged their positions; The word `\"am\"` and word `\"than\"` exchanged their positions; The middle length word `\"him\"` remain in its original position.",
