  "description": "The characters of Chima need your help. Their weapons got mixed up! They need you to write a program that accepts the name of a character in Chima then tells which weapon he/she owns.\n\nFor example: for the character `\"Laval\"` your program should return the solution `\"Laval-Shado Valious\"`\n\nYou must complete the following character-weapon pairs:\n\n* Laval-Shado Valious, \n* Cragger-Vengdualize, \n* Lagravis-Blazeprowlor, \n* Crominus-Grandorius, \n* Tormak-Tygafyre, \n* LiElla-Roarburn. \n    \nReturn `\"Not a character\"` for invalid inputs.",
