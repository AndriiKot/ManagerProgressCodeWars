  "description": "In this Kata, you will be given a number and your task will be to return the nearest prime number. \n\n```Haskell\nsolve(4) = 3. The nearest primes are 3 and 5. If difference is equal, pick the lower one. \nsolve(125) = 127\n```\n\nWe'll be testing for numbers up to `1E10`. `500` tests.\n\nMore examples in test cases. \n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you like Prime Katas, you will enjoy this Kata: [Simple Prime Streaming](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a908da30025e995880000e3)",
