  "description": "## Task\n In order to stop the Mad Coder evil genius you need to decipher the encrypted message he sent to his minions. The message contains several numbers that, when typed into a supercomputer, will launch a missile into the sky blocking out the sun, and making all the people on Earth grumpy and sad.\n\n You figured out that some numbers have a modified single digit in their binary representation. More specifically, in the given number `n` the `k`<sup>th</sup> bit from the right was initially set to 0, but its current value might be different. It's now up to you to write a function that will change the `k`<sup>th</sup> bit of `n` back to 0.\n\n## Example\n\n For n = 37 and k = 3, the output should be `33`.\n\n 37<sub>10</sub> = 100<font color='red'>1</font>01<sub>2</sub> ~> 100<font color='red'>0</font>01<sub>2</sub> = 33<sub>10</sub>\n\n For n = 37 and k = 4, the output should be 37.\n\n The 4<sup>th</sup> bit is 0 already (looks like the Mad Coder forgot to encrypt this number), so the answer is still 37.\n\n## Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` integer `n`\n\n Constraints: 0 ≤ n ≤ 2<sup>31</sup> - 1.\n\n - `[input]` integer `k`\n\n The `1-based` index of the changed bit (`counting from the right`).\n\n Constraints: 1 ≤ k ≤ 31.\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n## More Challenge\n - Are you a One-Liner? Please try to complete the kata in one line(no test for it) ;-)",
