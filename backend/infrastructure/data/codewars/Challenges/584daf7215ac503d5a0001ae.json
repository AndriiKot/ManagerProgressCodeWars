  "description": "In this kata your task is to differentiate a mathematical expression given as a string in prefix notation. The result should be the derivative of the expression returned in prefix notation.\n\nTo simplify things we will use a simple list format made up of parentesis and spaces. \n\n- The expression format is (func arg1) or (op arg1 arg2) where op means operator, func means function and arg1, arg2 are aguments to the operator or function. For example (+ x 1) or (cos x)\n\n- The expressions will always have balanced parentesis and with spaces between list items.\n\n- Expression operators, functions and arguments will all be lowercase.\n\n- Expressions are single variable expressions using ```x``` as the variable.\n\n- Expressions can have nested arguments at any depth for example ```(+ (* 1 x) (* 2 (+ x 1)))```\n\nExamples of prefix notation in this format:\n\n``` \n(+ x 2)        // prefix notation version of x+2\n\n(* (+ x 3) 5)  // same as 5 * (x + 3)\n\n(cos (+ x 1))  // same as cos(x+1)\n\n(^ x 2)        // same as x^2 meaning x raised to power of 2\n```\n\n\nThe operators and functions you are required to implement are ```+ - * / ^ cos sin tan exp ln``` where ```^``` means raised to power of. ```exp``` is the exponential function (same as `e^x`) and ```ln``` is the natural logarithm (base e). \n\nExample of input values and their derivatives:\n\n``` \n(* 1 x) => 1\n\n(^ x 3) => (* 3 (^ x 2))\n\n(cos x) => (* -1 (sin x))\n```\n\nIn addition to returning the derivative your solution must also do *some* simplifications of the result but only what is specified below. \n\n- The returned expression should not have unecessary 0 or 1 factors. For example it should not return ```(* 1 (+ x 1))``` but simply the term ```(+ x 1)``` similarly it should not return ```(* 0 (+ x 1))``` instead it should return just 0\n\n- Results with two constant values such as for example ```(+ 2 2)``` should be evaluated and returned as a single value 4\n\n- Any argument raised to the zero power should return 1 and if raised to 1 should return the same value or variable. For example (^ x 0) should return 1 and (^ x 1) should return x\n\n- No simplifications are expected for functions like cos, sin, exp, ln... (but their arguments might require a simplification).\n\nThink recursively and build your answer according to the [rules of derivation](http://www.rapidtables.com/math/calculus/derivative.htm) and sample test cases.\n\nIf you need to diff any test expressions you can use [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/) however remember we use prefix format in this kata.\n\nBest of luck !\n",
