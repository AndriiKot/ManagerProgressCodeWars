  "description": "Two numbers are **relatively prime** if their greatest common factor is 1; in other words: they cannot be divided by any other common numbers than 1.\n\n`13, 16, 9, 5, and 119` are all relatively prime because they share no common factors, except for 1. To see this, I will show their factorizations:\n\n```\n 13: 13\n 16: 2 * 2 * 2 * 2\n  9: 3 * 3\n  5: 5\n119: 17 * 7\n```\n\n  \nComplete the function that takes 2 arguments: a number (`n`), and a list of numbers (`arr`). The function should return a list of all the numbers in `arr` that are relatively prime to `n`. All numbers will be positive integers.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\nn = 8\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n>> [1, 3, 5, 7]\n\nn = 15\narr = [72, 27, 32, 61, 77, 11, 40]\n>> [32, 61, 77, 11]\n\nn = 210\narr = [15, 100, 2222222, 6, 4, 12369, 99]\n>> []\n```",
