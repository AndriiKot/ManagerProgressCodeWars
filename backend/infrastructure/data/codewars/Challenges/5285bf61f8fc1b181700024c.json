  "description": "Implement a function that normalizes out of range sequence indexes (converts them to 'in range' indexes) by making them repeatedly 'loop' around the array. The function should then return the value at that index. Indexes that are not out of range should be handled normally and indexes to empty sequences should return undefined/None/null depending on the language.\n\nFor positive numbers that are out of range, they loop around starting at the beginning, i.e.\n\n```\nindex = (length of array)     => return: first element of an array;\nindex = (length of array) + 1 => return: second element of an array;\nindex = (length of array) + 2 => return: third element of an array;\n...\nindex = 2 * (length of array) => return: first element of an array.\n```\n\nFor negative numbers, they loop starting from the end, i.e.\n\n```\nindex = -1                 => return: last element of an array;\nindex = -2                 => return: second to last element of an array;\nindex = -3                 => return: third to last element of an array;\n...\nindex = -(length of array) => return: last element of an array.\n```\n",
