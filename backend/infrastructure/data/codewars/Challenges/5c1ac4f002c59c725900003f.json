  "description": "Credits go to the fantastic Numberphile YouTube channel for the inspiration behind this kata - the specific video for it can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP-Ipsat90c&t=545s\n\nYour challenge in this Kata is to code a function ```check_sequence``` that checks a sequence of coin flip results for specific 'streak' patterns of Heads and Tails. Streaks are consecutive occurences of results -- a streak of length 3 would be ```'HHH'``` or ```'TTT'```. \n\nGiven a sequence such as ```'HTHHHHTTH'```, an integer ```l```, and integer ```n```, we want to check the existence of STRICTLY ```n```-number of streaks that are STRICTLY of length ```l``` in the sequence.\n\nBy STRICTLY of a certain length, we mean that those streaks are not greater than or less than that length ```l```. For instance, sequences such as 'HHHH' or 'TTTT' are streaks of length 4, and do not count as streaks of length 3, 2, or 1 even though those streaks might be contained within them.\n\nLikewise, we are looking for STRICTLY ```n``` occurences of streaks of a given length -- NOT more or less than the value of N.\n\nThe function ```check_sequence``` should return ```True``` if the sequence conforms to  this pattern, or ```False``` otherwise.\n\nFor example, ```check_sequence('HTHHHTTH', 3, 1)``` should return ```True```, because there is ```1``` streak of exactly length ```3``` ('HHH'). Likewise, ```check_sequence('HTHHHTTTHHHHT', 3, 2)``` should return ```True``` because there exists ```2``` streaks of exactly length ```3``` ('HHH' and 'TTT').\n\nTest cases are a mix of static cases and randomly generated cases. For the randomly generated cases:\n\n1. Coin flip sequences (e.g. 'HTHHT') are from character lengths of 5 to 70 inclusive\n2. L can take any integer value from 2 to 8 inclusive\n3. N can take any integer value from 1 to 8 inclusive\n\nBest of luck!",
