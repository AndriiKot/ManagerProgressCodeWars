  "description": "Laura really hates people using acronyms in her office and wants to force her colleagues to remove all acronyms before emailing her. She wants you to build a system that will edit out all known acronyms or else will notify the sender if unknown acronyms are present.\n\nAny combination of <b>three or more letters in upper case</b> will be considered an acronym. Acronyms will not be combined with lowercase letters, such as in the case of 'KPIs'. They will be kept isolated as a word/words within a string.\n\nFor any string: \n\n<li>All instances of 'KPI' must become \"key performance indicators\" </li>\n<li>All instances of 'EOD' must become \"the end of the day\" </li>\n<li>All instances of 'TBD' must become \"to be decided\"</li>\n<li>All instances of 'WAH' must become \"work at home\"</li>\n<li>All instances of 'IAM' must become \"in a meeting\"</li>\n<li>All instances of 'OOO' must become \"out of office\"</li>\n<li>All instances of 'NRN' must become \"no reply necessary\"</li>\n<li>All instances of 'CTA' must become \"call to action\"</li>\n<li>All instances of 'SWOT' must become \"strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats\"</li>\n<br>If there are any unknown acronyms in the string, Laura wants you to return <b>only</b> the message:</br>\n<li>'[acronym] is an acronym. I do not like acronyms. Please remove them from your email.'</li>\n\n<br>So if the acronym in question was 'BRB', you would return the string:</br>\n<li>'BRB is an acronym. I do not like acronyms. Please remove them from your email.'</li>\n\n<br>If there is more than one unknown acronym in the string, return <b>only the first</b> in your answer.</br>\n\nIf all acronyms can be replaced with full words according to the above, however, return <b>only</b> the altered string.\n\nIf this is the case, ensure that sentences still start with capital letters. '!' or '?' will not be used.",
