  "description": "You are given a case of n stacks, each of which contains n pennies, for some integer n. You are also given the expected weight of each individual penny.\n\nBut, you also know that one of these stacks contains only counterfeit pennies, whose weight is less than the weight of the legitimate pennies.\n\nCalculate the index of the counterfeit stack, which satisfies 0 <= index < size.\n\nThe weight of the pennies is private with no exposed getter, so you may wish to do this using the Penny.measure method, which accepts a List of pennies, and returns their total weight. However, you may only use this method once!\n\nThe method's input variables are \n  - pennies: A list of list of pennies. Each sublist represents a stack. The number of                pennies in a stack is equal to the total number of stacks.\n  - weight: The expected weight of each penny.\n  - cWeight: The weight of each counterfeit penny.\n  \n  Good luck! :)",
