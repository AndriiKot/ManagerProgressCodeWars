  "description": "Generate and return **all** possible increasing arithmetic progressions of six primes `[a, b, c, d, e, f]` between the given limits. Note: the upper and lower limits are inclusive.\n\nAn arithmetic progression is a sequence where the difference between consecutive numbers is the same, such as: 2, 4, 6, 8.\n\nA prime number is a number that is divisible only by itself and 1 (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)\n\nYour solutions should be returned as lists inside a list in ascending order of the first item (if there are multiple lists with same first item, return in ascending order for the second item etc) are the e.g: `[ [a, b, c, d, e, f], [g, h, i, j, k, l] ]` where `a < g`. If there are no solutions, return an empty list: `[]`\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\n0, 200    ==> [ [7, 37, 67, 97, 127, 157] ]\n\n150, 1000 ==> [ [157, 307, 457, 607, 757, 907],\n                [239, 359, 479, 599, 719, 839],\n                [281, 401, 521, 641, 761, 881],\n                [359, 389, 419, 449, 479, 509],\n                [503, 593, 683, 773, 863, 953],\n                [541, 571, 601, 631, 661, 691],\n                [641, 701, 761, 821, 881, 941] ]\n```",
