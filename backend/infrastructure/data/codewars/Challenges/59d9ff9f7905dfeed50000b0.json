  "description": "Consider the word `\"abode\"`. We can see that the letter `a` is in position `1` and `b` is in position `2`. In the alphabet, `a` and `b` are also in positions `1` and `2`. Notice also that `d` and `e` in `abode` occupy the positions they would occupy in the alphabet, which are positions `4` and `5`. \n\nGiven an array of words, return an array of the number of letters that occupy their positions in the alphabet for each word. For example,\n```\nsolve([\"abode\",\"ABc\",\"xyzD\"]) = [4, 3, 1]\n```\nSee test cases for more examples.\n\nInput will consist of alphabet characters, both uppercase and lowercase. No spaces.\n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you like this Kata, please try: \n\n[Last digit symmetry](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59a9466f589d2af4c50001d8)\n\n[Alternate capitalization](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59cfc000aeb2844d16000075)\n\n~~~if:fortran\n## Fortran-Specific Notes\n\nDue to how strings and arrays work in Fortran, some of the strings in the input array will inevitably contain trailing whitespace.  **For this reason, please [trim](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.3.4/gfortran/TRIM.html) your input strings before processing them.**\n~~~",
