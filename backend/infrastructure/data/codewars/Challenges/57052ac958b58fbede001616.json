  "description": "Check if given chord is minor or major.\n\n### Rules\n\n1. Basic minor/major chord have three elements.\n2. A chord is *minor* when the interval between first and second element = 3 and between second and third = 4\n3. A chord is *major* when the interval between first and second element = 4 and between second and third = 3\n4. In a minor/major chord the interval between first and third element is always = 7\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nThere is a preloaded list of the 12 notes of a chromatic scale built on C. This means that there are (almost) all allowed note' s names in music:\n\n```python\n['C', ['C#', 'Db'], 'D', ['D#', 'Eb'], 'E', 'F', ['F#', 'Gb'], 'G', ['G#', 'Ab'], 'A', ['A#', 'Bb'], 'B']\n```\n\nNote that e.g. 'C#' - 'C' = 1, 'C' - 'C#' = 1, 'Db' - 'C' = 1 and 'B' - 'C' = 1. \n\nInput:\nString of notes separated by whitespace, e. g. `'A C# E'`\n\nOutput:\nString message: `'Minor'`, `'Major'` or `'Not a chord'`",
