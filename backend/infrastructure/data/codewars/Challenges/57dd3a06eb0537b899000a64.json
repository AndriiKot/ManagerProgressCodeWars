  "description": "Oh No! \n\nThe song sheets have been dropped in the snow and the lines of each verse have become all jumbled up. \n\n<h1>Task</h1>\n\n```if-not:python\nYou have to write a comparator function which can sort the lines back into their correct order, otherwise Christmas will be cancelled!\n```\n\n```if:python\nYou have to write a sorting function which can organize the lines back into their correct order, otherwise Christmas will be cancelled!\n```\nReminder: Below is what the final verse *should* look like\n```\nOn the 12th day of Christmas my true love gave to me\n12 drummers drumming,\n11 pipers piping, \n10 lords a leaping, \n9 ladies dancing, \n8 maids a milking,\n7 swans a swimming, \n6 geese a laying, \n5 golden rings, \n4 calling birds,\n3 French hens, \n2 turtle doves and \na partridge in a pear tree.\n```\n\n<h1>Background</h1>\n\nA `Java` [comparator function](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html)  is described as below. Other languages are similar:\n\n> `int compare(T o1, T o2)`\nCompares its two arguments for order. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.",
