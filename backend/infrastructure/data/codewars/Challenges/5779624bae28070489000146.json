  "description": "Our AAA company is in need of some software to help with logistics: you will be given the width and height of a map, a list of x coordinates and a list of y coordinates of the supply points, starting to count from the top left corner of the map as 0.\n\nYour goal is to return a two dimensional array/list with every item having the value of the distance of the square itself from the closest supply point expressed as a simple integer.\n\nQuick examples:\n\n```python\nlogistic_map(3,3,[0],[0])\n#returns\n#[[0,1,2],\n# [1,2,3],\n# [2,3,4]]\nlogistic_map(5,2,[0,4],[0,0])\n#returns\n#[[0,1,2,1,0],\n# [1,2,3,2,1]]\n```\n```ruby\nlogistic_map(3,3,[0],[0])\n#returns\n#[[0,1,2],\n# [1,2,3],\n# [2,3,4]]\nlogistic_map(5,2,[0,4],[0,0])\n#returns\n#[[0,1,2,1,0],\n# [1,2,3,2,1]]\n```\n```javascript\nlogisticMap(3,3,[0],[0])\n//returns\n//[[0,1,2],\n// [1,2,3],\n// [2,3,4]]\nlogisticMap(5,2,[0,4],[0,0])\n//returns\n//[[0,1,2,1,0],\n// [1,2,3,2,1]]\n```\n```csharp\nLogisticMap(3,3,{0},{0})\n//returns\n//{{0,1,2},\n// {1,2,3},\n// {2,3,4}}\nLogisticMap(5,2,{0,4},{0,0})\n//returns\n//{{0,1,2,1,0},\n// {1,2,3,2,1}}\n```\n```dart\nlogisticMap(3,3,[0],[0])\n//returns\n//[[0,1,2],\n// [1,2,3],\n// [2,3,4]]\nlogisticMap(5,2,[0,4],[0,0])\n//returns\n//[[0,1,2,1,0],\n// [1,2,3,2,1]]\n```\n\nRemember that our company is operating with trucks, not drones, so you can simply use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry\">Manhattan distance</a>. If supply points are present, they are going to be within the boundaries of the map; if no supply point is present on the map, just return `None`/`nil`/`null` in every cell.\n\n```python\nlogistic_map(2,2,[],[])\n#returns\n#[[None,None],\n# [None,None]]\n```\n```ruby\nlogistic_map(2,2,[],[])\n#returns\n#[[None,None],\n# [None,None]]\n```\n```javascript\nlogisticMap(2,2,[],[])\n//returns\n//[[None,None],\n// [None,None]]\n```\n```csharp\nLogisticMap(2,2,{},{})\n//returns\n//{{-1,-1},\n// {-1,-1}}\n```\n```dart\nlogisticMap(2,2,[],[])\n//returns\n//[[null,null],\n// [null,null]]\n```\n\n**Note:** this one is taken (and a bit complicated) from a problem a real world AAA company [whose name I won't tell here] used in their interview. It was done by a friend of mine. It is nothing that difficult and I assume it is their own version of the FizzBuzz problem, but consider candidates were given about 30 mins to solve it.",
