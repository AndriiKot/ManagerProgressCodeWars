  "description": "#It's show time!\nArchers have gathered from all around the world to participate in the Arrow Function Faire. But the faire will only start if there are archers signed and if they all have enough arrows in their quivers - at least 5 is the requirement! Are all the archers ready?\n\n#Reference\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions\n\n#Argument\n`archers` is an array of integers, in which each element corresponds to the number of arrows each archer has.\n\n#Return\nYour function must return `true` if the requirements are met or `false` otherwise.\n\n#Examples\n`archersReady([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])` returns `false` because there are archers with not enough arrows.\n\n`archersReady([5, 6, 7, 8])` returns `true`.",
