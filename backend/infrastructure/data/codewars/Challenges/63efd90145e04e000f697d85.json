  "description": "This story will be about intervals.\n\nSo, in this kata your task is to write a program which, given a list of intervals and a list of numbers, determines for each number the appropriate intervals it belongs to and returns a string using the expected formatting (see below).\n\n### Inputs\n\n* Intervals are given as a list of tuples. Both boundaries of an interval are exclusive: `(3,11)` means any value `x` so that `3 < x < 11`.\n* the second argument is a list of values (integers)\n\n### Output\n\n* For one value in the list of numbers, identify all the inervals it belongs to and build a single string with the following notations:\n  - `2` belong to the interval `(1,4)`, so the output would be: `\"2 ∈ (1;4)\"`. Note the semi colon in the string representation of the interval.\n  - With the intervals: `(1,3)`, `(3,5)` and `(2,9)`, `4` belongs to the two last only, so the output would be: `\"4 ∈ (3;5) ∩ (2;9)\"`\n  - The intervals are handled in the order of the list of intervals argument.\n* When several numbers are given:\n  - Strings are concatenated together, separated by `and`:\n    ```\n    intervals: [(2,5), (3,8)]\n    numbers:   [4, 6]\n    output:    \"4 ∈ (2;5) ∩ (3;8) and 6 ∈ (3;8)\"\n    ```\n  - Numbers are handled in the order of the argument.\n\n* Numbers that don't belong to any intervals are omitted from the output\n\nEnjoy <span style=\"color: pink\">/ᐠ｡.｡ᐟ\\\\</span>",
