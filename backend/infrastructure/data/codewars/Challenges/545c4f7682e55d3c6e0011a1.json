  "description": "There are a **n** balls numbered from 0 to **n-1** (0,1,2,3,etc). Most of them have the same weight, but one is heavier. Your task is to find it.\n\nYour function will receive two arguments - a `scales` object, and a ball count. The `scales` object has only one method:\n\n```javascript\n    getWeight(left, right)\n```\n```python\n    get_weight(left, right)\n```\n```ocaml\n    get_weight left right\n```\n\nwhere `left` and `right` are arrays (or lists, vectors ...) of numbers of balls to put on left and right pan respectively.\n\nIf the method returns `-1` - left pan is heavier\n\nIf the method returns `1` - right pan is heavier\n\nIf the method returns `0` - both pans weigh the same\n\nSo what makes this the \"ubermaster\" version of this kata? First, it's not restricted to 8 balls as in the previous versions - your solution has to work for 8-500 balls. \n\nSecond, you can't use the scale any more than mathematically necessary. Here's a chart:\n\n    ball count | uses\n    -----------------\n             1 |    0\n           2-3 |    1\n           4-9 |    2\n         10-27 |    3\n         28-81 |    4\n        82-243 |    5\n       244-500 |    6\n\nToo hard?
