  "description": "A bug lives in a world which is a cuboid and has to walk from one corner of the cuboid to the opposite corner (see the picture below).\n\n\n<img src=\"https://www.technologyuk.net/mathematics/geometry/images/geometry_0161.gif\"\n     alt=\"Google 'Cuboid Space Diagonal' \"\n     style=\"float: right; margin-right: 10px;\" />\n\n### Task\nDefine a function which takes 3 arguments: the length `a` , width `b`, and height `c` of the bug's \"world\", and finds the shortest distance needed to **walk** from start to finish. The dimensions will be positive numbers.\n\n**Note**: The bug cannot fly and has to maintain contact with a surface at all times but can walk up walls.\n\n### Example\n\n```\na=1, b=2, c=3: distance=4.242640687119285\n```\n\n___\n\n### Hints\n\n**Hint 1**: Consider how many different routes can be made to get from start to finish. If stuck for where to start, click\n[here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/141856599@N06/42176717300/in/dateposted-public/) \nfor general guidance.\n\n**Hint 2**: Consider using paper and opening up the net of a cuboid (and think if there are multiple ways this can be viewed) and play around with it to find the shortest length.",
