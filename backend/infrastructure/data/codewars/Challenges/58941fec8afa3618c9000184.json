  "description": "### Task\n Each day a plant is growing by `upSpeed` meters. Each night that plant's height decreases by `downSpeed` meters due to the lack of sun heat. Initially, plant is 0 meters tall. We plant the seed at the beginning of a day. We want to know when the height of the plant will reach a certain level.\n\n### Example\n\n For `upSpeed = 100, downSpeed = 10 and desiredHeight = 910`, the output should be `10`.\n \n ```\n After day 1 --> 100\n After night 1 --> 90\n After day 2 --> 190\n After night 2 --> 180\n After day 3 --> 280\n After night 3 --> 270\n After day 4 --> 370\n After night 4 --> 360\n After day 5 --> 460\n After night 5 --> 450\n After day 6 --> 550\n After night 6 --> 540\n After day 7 --> 640\n After night 7 --> 630\n After day 8 --> 730\n After night 8 --> 720\n After day 9 --> 820\n After night 9 --> 810\n After day 10 --> 910 \n ```\n \n For `upSpeed = 10, downSpeed = 9 and desiredHeight = 4`, the output should be `1`.\n \n Because the plant reach to the desired height at day 1(10 meters).\n \n ```\n After day 1 --> 10\n ```\n\n### Input/Output\n\n```if-not:sql\n - `[input]` integer `upSpeed`\n\n    A positive integer representing the daily growth.\n\n    Constraints: `5 ≤ upSpeed ≤ 100.`\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `downSpeed`\n\n    A positive integer representing the nightly decline.\n\n    Constraints: `2 ≤ downSpeed < upSpeed.`\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `desiredHeight`\n\n    A positive integer representing the threshold.\n\n    Constraints: `4 ≤ desiredHeight ≤ 1000.`\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\n    The number of days that it will take for the plant to reach/pass desiredHeight (including the last day in the total count).\n```\n```if:sql\n## Input\n\n~~~\n-----------------------------------------\n|     Table     |    Column      | Type |\n|---------------+----------------+------|\n| growing_plant | down_speed     | int  |\n|               | up_speed       | int  |\n|               | desired_height | int  |\n-----------------------------------------\n~~~\n\n### Columns\n* `up_speed`: A positive integer representing the daily growth.
