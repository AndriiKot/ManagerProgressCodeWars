  "description": "There is a game called SET, where the goal is to find 3 cards that match some criterias. Each card has 4 attributes:\n\n- count: 1, 2 or 3\n- colour: red, blue or green\n- shape: rectangular, oval or wave\n- filling: plain, shaded or empty\n\nEvery possible combination is represented (except if you loose a card, but this is a computer game, so no lost cards!), so in total there are 3 ^ 4 = 81 cards.\n\nIn order for 3 cards to form a set, EACH of the attributes of the three cards has to be either the same or completely different. So you can have for the color\n\n- red + red + red\n- red + green + blue\n\nbut NOT\n\n- red + red + blue\n\nSome examples for all 4 attributes:\n\n- SET: 1 red plain rect + 2 red plain rect + 3 red plain rect\n- SET: 1 red plain rect + 1 green plain rect + 1 blue plain rect\n- NOT a SET: 1 red plain rect + 2 red plain rect + 3 red plain oval -> 2 rectangulars and 1 oval\n- NOT a SET: 1 red plain rect + 1 green plain rect + 1 blue shaded rect -> 2 plain and 1 shaded\n\nIn the game a total of 12 cards are laid on the table, in a 4 x 3 grid, and the goal is to find as many NON-OVERLAPPING SETS as possible.\n\nA card is defined as\n```ruby\nCard = Struct.new( :count, :color, :shape, :filling )\n```\n```javascript\n[ count, color, shape, filling ]\n```\n```kotlin\nintArray( count, color, shape, filling )\n```\nand every attribute is either 1, 2 or 3.\n\nYour method has to take a 2D-array of cards and return an array of solutions. The 2D-array is set up as\n\n```\ncards[x][y]\nwith\n0 <= x <= 3\nand\n0 <= y <= 2\n```\n\nand the result has to return [ x, y ] - tuples. Here are some possible results:\n\n- [] - no SET found\n- [ [ [ 0,0 ], [ 1,2 ], [1,3 ] ] ] - found 1 SET\n- [ [ [ 0,0 ], [ 1,2 ], [1,3 ] ], [ [ 2,2 ], [ 3,2 ], [1,1 ] ] ] - found 2 SETs\n\nThe following IS NOT A VALID RESULT, because the card at [1,2] is used twice!\n\n- [ [ [ 0,0 ], [ 1,2 ], [1,3 ] ], [ [ 2,2 ], [ 3,2 ], [1,2 ] ] ] - found 2 SETs\n\nTake care to\n\n- not use cards twice\n- have as much solutions as possible (there are cases where you could have different number of solutions...)\n- make it simple ;)\n\nThe testing algorithm tries very hard to be fair, that is, to accept as many results as possible. Your solution for a given set is considered correct, if:\n\n- you return the maximum number of solutions\n- every given solution is correct\n- no card is used twice",
