  "description": "We define the score of permutations of combinations, of an integer number (the function to obtain this value:```sc_perm_comb```) as the total sum of all the numbers obtained from the permutations of all the possible combinations of its digits.\nFor example we have the number 348.\n```python\nsc_perm_comb(348) = 3 + 4 + 8 + 34 + 38 + 48 + 43 + 83 + 84 + 348 + 384 + 834 + 843 + 438 + 483  = 3675\n```\nIf the number has a digit 0, the numbers formed by a leading 0 should be discarded:\n```python\nsc_perm_comb(340) = 3 + 4 + 34 + 30 + 40 + 43 + 340 + 304 + 430 + 403 = 1631\n```\nDuplicate permutations can occur if the number has more than once the same digit, but they should be added only once in the result:\n```python\nsc_perm_comb(333) = 3 + 33 + 333 = 369\n```\nIf the number has only one digit its score is the same number:\n```python\nsc_perm_comb(6) = 6\nsc_perm_comb(0) = 0\n```\n\nEnjoy it!!\n",
