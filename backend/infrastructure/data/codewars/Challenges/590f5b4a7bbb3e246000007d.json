  "description": "You will be given two inputs: a string of words and a letter. For each string, return the alphabetic character after every instance of letter(case insensitive). \n\nIf there is a number, punctuation or underscore following the letter, it should not be returned. \n\n```\nIf letter = 'r':\n\"are you really learning Ruby?\" # => \"eenu\"\n\"Katy Perry is on the radio!\"   # => \"rya\"\n\"Pirates say arrrrrrrrr.\"       # => \"arrrrrrrr\"\n\"r8 your friend\"                # => \"i\"\n```\n\nReturn an empty string if there are no instances of `letter` in the given string.\n\nAdapted from: [Ruby Kickstart](https://github.com/JoshCheek/ruby-kickstart/blob/master/session1/challenge/7_string.rb)",
