  "description": "A database entry specialist goofed up and hence made duplicate entries of the marks obtained by a few students. You need to clean it up and make sure the data has only single entries per user\n\nCreate a method that returns these values and while you are at it, sort it in increasing order of the score\n\nThe input values can be nil or an array of arrays.\nThe first element of the array is the username and the last element is the marks. Elements in the middle are just additional way of user identification.\n\nThe names are case sensitive. 'a' and 'A' are different\n\nExample\n\n```ruby\n\ndataclean(nil)                               #returns nil\n\ndataclean([['a',5],['b',3],['a',5]])         # returns [['b',3],['a',5]]\n\ndataclean([['a',5],['a',5]])                 # returns [['a',5]]\n\ndataclean([['a',2],['b',3],['a',2]])         # returns [['a',2],['b',3]]\n\n```\n",
