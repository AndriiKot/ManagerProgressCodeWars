  "description": "For this challenge you need to create a simple query to display each unique clan with their total points and ranked by their total points.\n\n### people table schema\n- name\n- points\n- clan  \n\nYou should then return a table that resembles below\n### select on\n- rank\n- clan\n- total_points\n- total_people\n\nThe query must rank each clan by their total_points, you must return each unqiue clan and if there is no clan name (i.e. it's an empty string) you must replace it with `[no clan specified]`, you must sum the total_points for each clan and the total_people within that clan.\n\n##Note\nThe data is loaded from the live leaderboard, this means values will change but also could cause the kata to time out retreiving the information.\n\n> NOTE: You're solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.",
