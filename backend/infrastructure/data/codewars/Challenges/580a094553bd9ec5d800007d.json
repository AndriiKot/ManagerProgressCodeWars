  "description": "# Backstory\n<img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BQRHvcFCQAABGH6.jpg\">\n\nAs a treat, I'll let you read part of the script from a classic 'I'm Alan Partridge episode:\n```\nLynn: Alan, there’s that teacher chap.\nAlan: Michael, if he hits me, will you hit him first?\nMichael: No, he’s a customer. I cannot hit customers. I’ve been told. I’ll go and get some stock.\nAlan: Yeah, chicken stock.\nPhil: Hello Alan.\nAlan: Lynn, hand me an apple pie. And remove yourself from the theatre of conflict.\nLynn: What do you mean?\nAlan: Go and stand by the yakults. The temperature inside this apple turnover is 1,000 degrees. If I squeeze it, a jet of molten Bramley apple is going to squirt out. Could go your way, could go mine. Either way, one of us is going down.\n```\nAlan is known for referring to the temperature of the apple turnover as `Hotter than the sun!`. According to  <a href=\"http://www.space.com/17137-how-hot-is-the-sun.html\">space.com</a> the temperature of the sun's corona is 2,000,000 degrees Celsius, but we will ignore the science for now. \n\n# Task\nYour job is simple, if `x` squared is more than 1000, return `It's hotter than the sun!!`, else, return `Help yourself to a honeycomb Yorkie for the glovebox.`\n\n**Note: Input will either be a positive integer (or a string for untyped languages).**\n\n# Other katas in this series:\n<a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/alan-partridge-i-partridge-watch\">Alan Partridge I - Partridge Watch</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/alan-partridge-iii-london\">Alan Partridge III - London</a>\n",
