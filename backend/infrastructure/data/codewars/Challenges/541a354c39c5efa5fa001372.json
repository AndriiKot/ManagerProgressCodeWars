  "description": "An [IPv4 address](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) is a 32-bit number that identifies a device on the internet.\n\nWhile computers read and write IP addresses as a 32-bit number, we prefer to read them in dotted-decimal notation, which is basically the number split into 4 chunks of 8 bits, converted to decimal, and delmited by a dot.\n\nIn this kata, you will create the function `ipToNum` (or `ip_to_num`, depending on the language) that takes an `ip` address and converts it to a number, as well as the function `numToIp` (or `num_to_ip`) that takes a number and converts it to an IP address string.  Input will always be valid.\n\n## Conversion Example\n```javascript\n//original IP address\n192.168.1.1\n\n//breaks down into 4 binary octets\n11000000 . 10101000 . 00000001 . 00000001\n\n//which are merged together (unsigned 32-bit binary)\n11000000101010000000000100000001\n\n//and finally converted to base 10\n3232235777\n ```\n\nNote that the binary octets are *unsigned* (so we can't have negative numbers).\n\n```if:javascript,coffeescript,typescript,purescript\nBe careful: JavaScript does bitwise arithmetic on *signed* 32-bits integers.\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### ipToNum / ip_to_num\n```\n'192.168.1.1' converts to 3232235777\n'10.0.0.0'    converts to  167772160\n'176.16.0.1'  converts to 2953838593\n```\n    \n### numToIp / num_to_ip\n```\n3232235777 converts to '192.168.1.1'\n 167772160 converts to    '10.0.0.0'\n2953838593 converts to  '176.16.0.1'\n```\n",
