  "description": "Create a class called `Code` that allows to store arbitrary \"named code\" as in the example below:\n\n```ruby\nCode.green = '00FF00'\nCode.red = 0xFF0000\n\nCode.green # => known code, return exactly as spcified: '00FF00'\nCode.red   # => known code, return exactly as spcified: 0xFF0000\nCode.blue  # => unknown code, raise exception\n```\n\nBasically, it starts from a blank slate. If you try to call any method on it, it raises an exception. \n\nThen, whenever somebody specifies a new code by calling `Code.<name-of-the-code> = <something>`, it remembers that, and the next time somebody calls the `<name-of-the-code>` method, it returns the stored value (`<something>`). Note that this value can be anything - a string, a number, any object, including `nil`. \n\nIf a method is called for an unknown code, an exception should still be raised.",
