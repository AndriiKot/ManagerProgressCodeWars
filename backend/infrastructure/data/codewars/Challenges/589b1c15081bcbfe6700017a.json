  "description": "Fast & Furious Driving School's (F&F) charges for lessons are as below: \n\n<p><table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Time</th>\n    <th>Cost</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Up to 1st hour</td>\n    <td>$30</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Every subsequent half hour**</td>\n    <td>$10</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n  <td><h6>** Subsequent charges are calculated by rounding up to nearest half hour.</h6></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<p>For example, if student X has a lesson for 1hr 20 minutes, he will be charged $40 (30+10) for 1 hr 30 mins and if he has a lesson for 5 minutes, he will be charged $30 for the full hour. \n\nOut of the kindness of its heart, F&F also provides a 5 minutes grace period. So, if student X were to have a lesson for 65 minutes or 1 hr 35 mins, he will only have to pay for an hour or 1hr 30 minutes respectively. \n\nFor a given lesson time in minutes (min) , write a function <i>cost</i> to calculate how much the lesson costs. Input is always > 0.\n",
