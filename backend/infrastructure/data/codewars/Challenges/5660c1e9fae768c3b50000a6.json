  "description": " [Ermahgerd girl](http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/10/ermahgerd-girl-true-story 'ermahgerd girl') wants you to write a function that translates english into **ermahgerd language**!! There are many different subtleties to the translation but for this Kata we'll focus on just a few core ones:\n\n<p style=\"color: #5CE8A4\">For this specific translation it's probably best to implement these features in the order below:</p>\n\n* Ermahgerd girl is ALWAYS very excited so everything needs to be in **UPPERCASE!**\n\n* Each **vowel** should be replaced with: `'ER'`\n\n* Double \"ER\"s --->`'ERER'` and the letters `'ERH'` should be replaced with just `'ER'`\n\n* The letters `'MY'` (as a word or part of a word) should be replaced with: `'MAH'`\n\n\n<p style=\"color: #5CE8A4\">And to help with readability:</p>\n\n* Duplicate `'RR's` should become a single `'R'`\n\n* After these steps are complete words `longer than 4 letters` that end in `\"ER\"` should have the `\"ER\"` trimmed off (the tricky bit is to make sure it can handle commas or spaces)\n\n\n Ermahgerd girl is VERY excited to see your solutions!\n\n![ermagherd](http://s14.postimg.org/5nbvfil6p/ermahgerd.jpg)",
