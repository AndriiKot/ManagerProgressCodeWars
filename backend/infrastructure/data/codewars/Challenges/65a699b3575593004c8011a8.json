  "description": "Imagine we have a table named `products` with columns `product_id` and `features`. In this case, features is a string containing various single-character codes that represent different attributes or features of a product. For instance, each character could stand for a feature like 'waterproof', 'rechargeable', 'wireless', etc. There are no duplicate symbols within the features column for each product - each character in the `features` string is unique for that product (both uppercase and lowercase are allowed, but no repetitions).\n\nThe table structure is\n\n* `product_id` (varchar, primary key)\n* `features` (varchar(50))\n\nExample Data:\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>product_id</th><th>features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>P001</td><td>AB</td></tr><tr><td>P002</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>P003</td><td>ADE</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\nIn this scenario, we want to break down the features string into individual characters so that we can analyze or operate on each feature separately.\n\nWrite a query that will produce a result where each row represents a single feature of a product. For instance, for a product with 'AB' in the features column, there will be two rows in the output: one for 'A' and one for 'B'. This is useful for analyzing, reporting, or even joining with another table that explains what each feature code stands for.\n\nResults need to have 2 columns (`product_id` and `feature`) and should be ordered by `product_id` (asc) and then by the sequence of the letters as they appear in the features string for each product.\n\n#### Desired Output\n\nThe desired output should look like this:\n\n<table><!----><tr><th>product_id</th><th>feature</th></tr><tr><td>P001</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>P001</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>P002</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>P003</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>P003</td><td>D</td></tr><tr><td>P003</td><td>E</td></tr></table>\n\nGLHF!",
