  "description": "The following code was thought to be working properly, however when the code tries to access the age of the person instance it fails. \n\n```ruby\nperson = Person.new('Yukihiro', 'Matsumoto', 47)\nputs person.full_name\nputs person.age\n```\n```python\nperson = Person('Yukihiro', 'Matsumoto', 47)\nprint(person.full_name)\nprint(person.age)\n```\n\nFor this exercise you need to fix the code so that it works correctly.\n\nNote: the order of the person's full name is first name and last name.",
