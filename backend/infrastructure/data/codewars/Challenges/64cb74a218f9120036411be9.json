  "description": "You are given a table called `customer_purchases` that contains information about customer purchases. You are required to write an SQL query to find the number of new unique customers (as `num_new_customers` column) on each date. A new customer is defined as one making their first purchase. \n\nTable schema:\n\n* `customer_id` (integer) - The unique identifier for each customer\n* `date` (date) - The date of the purchase\n* `product` (varchar) - The product purchased by the customer\n\nHere's an example of what the data table might look like:\n\n```\ncustomer_id |    date    | product\n------------+------------+----------\n      1     | 31-08-2023 | Orange\n      1     | 31-08-2023 | Orange\n      3     | 31-08-2023 | Apple\n      1     | 24-09-2023 | Apple\n      4     | 25-09-2023 | Orange\n```\n\nThe result should be:\n\n```\n    date     | num_new_customers |\n-------------+--------------------\n 31-08-2023  | 2                 |\n 25-09-2023  | 1                 |\n``` \n\nResultant query should be ordered by `date` in ascending order\n\nGLHF!\n      \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n",
