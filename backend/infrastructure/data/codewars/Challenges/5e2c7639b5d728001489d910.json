  "description": "You need to write a code that will return product ID from string representing URL for that product's page in your online shop.\n\nAll URLs are formatted similarly, first there is a domain `exampleshop.com`, then we have name of a product separated by dashes(`-`), then we have letter `p` indicating start of product ID, then an actual ID (no limit on length), and lastly 8-digit long representation of date when product got added followed by `.html`.It can look like this:\n\n`exampleshop.com/fancy-coffee-cup-p-90764-12052019.html` >> productID is `90764`\n\n`exampleshop.com/dry-water-just-add-water-to-get-water-p-147-24122017.html` >> productID is 147\n\n`exampleshop.com/public-toilet-proximity-radar-p-942312798-01012020.html` >> productID is `942312798`\n\n(NOTE: Product name can also contain letter p or digits)\n\nYour code needs to return the Product ID as a string. All URLs will be valid product URLs and all will follow above structure.",
