  "description": "John keeps a backup of his old personal phone book as a text file. On each line of the file\nhe can find the phone number (formated as `+X-abc-def-ghij` where X stands for one or two digits), the corresponding name\nbetween `<` and `>` and the address. \n\nUnfortunately everything is mixed, things are not always in the same order; parts of lines are cluttered with non-alpha-numeric characters\n(except inside phone number and name).\n\nExamples of John's phone book lines:\n\n`\"/+1-541-754-3010 156 Alphand_St. <J Steeve>\\n\"`\n\n`\" 133, Green, Rd. <E Kustur> NY-56423 ;+1-541-914-3010!\\n\"`\n\n`\"<Anastasia> +48-421-674-8974 Via Quirinal Roma\\n\"`\n\nCould you help John with a program that, given the lines of his phone book and a phone number `num`\nreturns a string for this number : `\"Phone => num, Name => name, Address => adress\"`\n\n#### Examples:\n\n```\ns = \"/+1-541-754-3010 156 Alphand_St. <J Steeve>\\n 133, Green, Rd. <E Kustur> NY-56423 ;+1-541-914-3010!\\n\"\n\nphone(s, \"1-541-754-3010\") should return \"Phone => 1-541-754-3010, Name => J Steeve, Address => 156 Alphand St.\"\n\n```\n- It can happen that there are many people for a phone number `num`, then return : `\"Error => Too many people: num\"` \n\n- or it can happen that the number `num` is not in the phone book, in that case \nreturn: `\"Error => Not found: num\"`\n\n#### Notes\n- Codewars stdout doesn't print part of a string when between `<` and `>`\n- You can see other examples in the test cases.\n\n- JavaScript random tests completed by @matt c.",
