  "description": "Given an non-empty list or array (depending on language) of non-empty uppercase words, compute the minimum number of words, which, when removed from the list, leaves the rest of the list in strictly ascending lexicographic order.\n\nExamples:\n\n[\"THE\",\"QUICK\",\"BROWN\",\"FOX\",\"JUMPS\",\"OVER\",\"THE\",\"LAZY\",\"DOG\"] should return 4, because removing \"THE\", \"QUICK\", \"LAZY\" & \"DOG\" leaves the sorted list [\"BROWN\",\"FOX\",\"JUMPS\",\"OVER\",\"THE\"].\n\n[\"JACKDAW\",\"LOVE\",\"MY\",\"BIG\",\"SPHINX\",\"OF\",\"QUARTZ\"] should return 2, because removing \"BIG\" & \"SPHINX\" leaves the sorted list [\"JACKDAW\",\"LOVE\",\"MY\",\"OF\",\"QUARTZ\"].\n\n[\"A\",\"A\",\"A\",\"A\"] should return 3, because equal elements are NOT regarded as sorted, so all but one of them need to be removed.\n\nSource: Programming Competition at the [Midwest Instructional Computing Symposium 2011](http://micsymposium.org/)\n\nSomewhat similar, but harder, kata are [Make an increasing sequence](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5848f4f2d8543bf3c7000602) and [Find the Longest Increasing or Decreasing Combination in an Array](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5715508de1bf8174c1001832)",
