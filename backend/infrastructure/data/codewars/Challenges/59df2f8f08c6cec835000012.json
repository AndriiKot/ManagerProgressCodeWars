  "description": "John has invited some friends. His list is:\n```\ns = \"Fred:Corwill;Wilfred:Corwill;Barney:Tornbull;Betty:Tornbull;Bjon:Tornbull;Raphael:Corwill;Alfred:Corwill\";\n```\n\nCould you make a program that \n- makes this string uppercase\n- gives it sorted in alphabetical order by last name. \n\nWhen the last names are the same, sort them by first name.\nLast name and first name of a guest come in the result between parentheses separated by a comma.\n\nSo the result of function `meeting(s)` will be:\n```\n\"(CORWILL, ALFRED)(CORWILL, FRED)(CORWILL, RAPHAEL)(CORWILL, WILFRED)(TORNBULL, BARNEY)(TORNBULL, BETTY)(TORNBULL, BJON)\"\n```\nIt can happen that in two distinct families with the same family name two people have the same first name too.\n\n#### Notes\n- You can see another examples in the \"Sample tests\".\n\n",
