  "description": "Description:   \nAt 'We Rate Dogs', we try our best to give dogs accurate ratings, which will always be above 10/10. Because they're good dogs. Over the weekend Bront has come in and hacked our system, lowering the ratings of dogs to below 10/10. \nPlease help to fix Brant's bad system and give the dogs their original ratings. _They're good dogs Brent._\n\nTask:  \nThe `function weRateDogs(str, rating)` takes a string and an integer as the inputs. Within the string is an incorrect rating x/y. \n\nYou will need to change the incorrect rating `x/y` to the correct rating `rating/10`. The given string may contain numbers and letters, but no special characters other than `/`. \n\nFor example:  \nif you are given the following string:  \n`'This is Max99. She has one ear that is always s1ightly higher than the other 4/10 wonky af'`  \nAnd the following rating: `11`\nreturn: `'This is Max99. She has one ear that is always s1ightly heigher than the other 11/10 wonky af'`",
