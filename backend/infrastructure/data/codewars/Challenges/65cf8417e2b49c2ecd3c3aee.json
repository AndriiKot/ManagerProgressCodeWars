  "description": "You are given a positive integer *n*.\n\n\nThe task is to calculate how many binary numbers without leading zeros (such that their length is *n* and they do *not* contain two zeros in a row) there are. Note that zero itself (\"0\") *meets* the conditions (for n = 1). \n\n\nFor example, there are three eligible binary numbers of length 3:\n1) *101*\n2) *110*\n3) *111*\n*100 is not suitable.*\n\n\nRemember that *n* may be fairly big (up to 10^4). Good luck! ",
