  "description": "## Problem\n\nDetermine whether a non-negative integer number is **colorful** or not.\n\n`263` is a colorful number because `[2, 6, 3, 2*6, 6*3, 2*6*3]` are all different; whereas  \n`236` is not colorful, because `[2, 3, 6, 2*3, 3*6, 2*3*6]` has `6` twice.\n\nSo take all consecutive subsets of digits, take their products, and ensure all the products are different.\n\n## Examples\n\n```ruby\n263  -->  true\n236  -->  false\n```",
