  "description": "## Welcome to the Codewars Bar!\n\nCodewars Bar recommends you drink 1 glass of water per standard drink so you're not hungover tomorrow morning.\n\nYour fellow coders have bought you several drinks tonight in the form of a string. Return a string suggesting how many glasses of water you should drink to not be hungover.\n\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n\"1 beer\"  -->  \"1 glass of water\"\nbecause you drank one standard drink\n\n\"1 shot, 5 beers, 2 shots, 1 glass of wine, 1 beer\"  -->  \"10 glasses of water\"\nbecause you drank ten standard drinks\n```\n\nNote:\n\nTo keep the things simple, we'll consider that any \"numbered thing\" in the string is a drink. Even `\"1 bear\"` -> `\"1 glass of water\"`; or `\"1 chainsaw and 2 pools\"` -> `\"3 glasses of water\"`...\n",
