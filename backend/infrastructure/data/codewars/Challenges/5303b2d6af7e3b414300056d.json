  "description": "Make a utility function to clone a regex object that will give exactly the same results as the original. The functionality should be able to be used in two methods: `RegExp.clone(/regex/)` and `(/regex/).clone()`. Just because. ;P\n\n> NOTE: any time a regex is \"run\" (using match, replace, exec, etc.), its state may change such that the next time it is run, a different result is produced.",
