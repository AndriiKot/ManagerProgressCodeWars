  "description": "# Task\n\nYou are given a string `s`. Your task is to count the number of each letter (A-Z), and make a vertical histogram as result. Look at the following examples to understand the rules.\n\n# Example\n\nFor `s = \"XXY YY ZZZ123ZZZ AAA BB C\"`, the output should be:\n```\n          *\n          *\n          *\n*       * *\n* *   * * *\n* * * * * *\nA B C X Y Z\n```\n# Rules\n\n- You just need to count the uppercase letters. Any other character will be ignored.\n- Using `*` to represent the number of characters. \n- The order of output is form A to Z. Characters that do not appear in the string are ignored.\n- To beautify the histogram, there is a space between every pair of columns.\n- There are no extra spaces at the end of each row. Also, use \"\\n\" to separate rows.\n- Happy Coding `^_^`\n",
