  "description": "In this Kata your task will be to return the count of pairs that have consecutive numbers as follows:\n```Haskell\npairs([1,2,5,8,-4,-3,7,6,5]) = 3\nThe pairs are selected as follows [(1,2),(5,8),(-4,-3),(7,6),5]\n--the first pair is (1,2) and the numbers in the pair are consecutive; Count = 1\n--the second pair is (5,8) and are not consecutive\n--the third pair is (-4,-3), consecutive. Count = 2\n--the fourth pair is (7,6), also consecutive. Count = 3. \n--the last digit has no pair, so we ignore.\n```\n\nMore examples in the test cases. \n\nGood luck!\n\nPlease also try [Simple time difference](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b76a34ff71e5de9db0000f2)",
