  "description": "Given some positive integers, I wish to print the integers such that all take up the same width by adding a minimum number of leading zeroes. No leading zeroes shall be added to the largest integer.\n\nFor example, given `1, 23, 2, 17, 102`, I wish to print out these numbers as follows:\n\n```\n001\n023\n002\n017\n102\n```\n\nWrite a function that takes a variable number of integers and returns the string to be printed out.",
