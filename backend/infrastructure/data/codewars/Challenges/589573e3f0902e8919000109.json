  "description": "## Task\n A noob programmer was given two simple tasks: sum and sort the elements of the given array `arr` = [a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>]. \n \n He started with summing and did it easily, but decided to store the sum he found in some random position of the original array which was a bad idea. Now he needs to cope with the second task, sorting the original array arr, and it's giving him trouble since he modified it.\n\n Given the array `shuffled`, consisting of elements a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>, and their sumvalue in random order, return the sorted array of original elements a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>.\n\n## Example\n\n For `shuffled = [1, 12, 3, 6, 2]`, the output should be `[1, 2, 3, 6]`.\n\n `1 + 3 + 6 + 2 = 12`, which means that 1, 3, 6 and 2 are original elements of the array.\n\n For `shuffled = [1, -3, -5, 7, 2]`, the output should be `[-5, -3, 2, 7]`.\n\n## Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer array `shuffled`\n\n    Array of at least two integers. It is guaranteed that there is an index i such that shuffled[i] = shuffled[0] + ... + shuffled[i - 1] + shuffled[i + 1] + ... + shuffled[n].\n\n    Constraints:\n\n    `2 ≤ shuffled.length ≤ 30,`\n\n    `-300 ≤ shuffled[i] ≤ 300.`\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer array\n\n    A `sorted` array of shuffled.length - 1 elements.",
