  "description": "The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people wrongly overestimate their knowledge or ability in a specific area. This tends to occur because a lack of self-awareness prevents them from accurately assessing their skills.\n\nAssume you have a PostgreSQL database with a table named \"users\". The \"users\" table has the following columns:\n\n* `id` (integer): a unique identifier for each user.\n* `name` (text): the name of the user.\n* `perceived_skill_level` (integer): the user's self-assessed skill level, from 1 to 10.\n* `actual_skill_level` (integer): the user's actual skill level, measured objectively, from 1 to 10.\n\nYour task is to write an SQL query that does the following: \n\n* Selects only those users where the perceived skill level is greater than the actual skill level.\n* For each of these users, calculates the difference between the perceived skill level and actual skill level as \"skill_overestimation\".\n* Adds a \"overconfidence_category\" message based on the degree of skill overestimation*\n    * 'Mild case of overconfidence': skill overestimation is 2 or less\n    * 'Moderate case of overconfidence': skill overestimation is greater than 2 and up to 5\n    * 'Serious case of overconfidence': skill overestimation is greater than 5 and up to 7\n    * 'Extreme case of Dunning-Kruger effect detected!': skill overestimation is more than 7\n    \nYou should return the following columns: \n\n* `id`: A unique identifier for each user. Used for sorting if overconfidence levels are equal.\n* `name`: The user's name. Included for easy identification of each result.\n* `skill_overestimation`: The computed difference between a user's perceived and actual skill levels. It measures the degree of overconfidence.\n* `overconfidence_category`: categorization of overconfidence, as described above\n\nThe query should order the result first by skill overestimation in descending order, and in the case of a tie, by user id in descending  order.  \n\nTo make a task a bit funnier, for random tests, I scrapped the usernames of the current top 100 Codewars users - let's see which of the Codewars stars have an extreme case of Dunning-Kruger effect :-)\n\nGLHF! \n\n### Desired Output\n\nThe desired output should look like this:\n\n<table><!----><tr><th>id</th><th>name</th><th>skill_overestimation</th><th>overconfidence_category</th></tr><tr><td>98</td><td>dcieslak</td><td>9</td><td>Extreme case of Dunning-Kruger effect detected!</td></tr><tr><td>95</td><td>dinglemouse</td><td>9</td><td>Extreme case of Dunning-Kruger effect detected!</td></tr><tr><td>69</td><td>monadius</td><td>8</td><td>Extreme case of Dunning-Kruger effect detected!</td></tr></table>\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
