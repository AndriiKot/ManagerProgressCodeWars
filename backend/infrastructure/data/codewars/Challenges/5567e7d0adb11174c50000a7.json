  "description": "This kata is about singly-[linked lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list).\nA linked list is an ordered set of data elements, each containing a link to its successor (and sometimes its predecessor, known as a double linked list).  You are you to implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element.\n\n`k` will be an integer greater than or equal to `1`.\n\n## Example\nFor example given the following linked list:\n`a -> b -> c -> d`\n\n* if k = 1 then d should be returned\n* if k = 2 then c should be returned\n* if k = 3 then b should be returned\n* if k = 4 then a should be returned\n* if k exceeds the length of the list then `None`(Python) or `null`(Java, JavaScript) or `false` (C) should be returned\n\nEach item in the linked list is a `Node` containing two fields:\n* data - the value of the node\n* next - pointing to the next node in the list, or to a null reference (null/NULL/None, depending on your language) for the last Node.\n\nAn empty list is represented as a null reference.",
