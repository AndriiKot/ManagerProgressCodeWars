  "description": "Your job is to change the given string `s` using a non-negative integer `n`.\n\nEach bit in `n` will specify whether or not to swap the case for each alphabetic character in `s`: if the bit is `1`, swap the case; if its `0`, leave it as is. When you finish with the last bit of `n`, start again with the first bit.\n\nYou should skip the checking of bits when a non-alphabetic character is encountered, but they should be preserved in their original positions.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nswap(\"Hello world!\", 11)  -->  \"heLLO wORLd!\"\n```\n\n...because `11` is `1011` in binary, so the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th and 9th alphabetical characters have to be swapped:\n\n```\nH e l l o   w o r l d !\n1 0 1 1 1 x 0 1 1 1 0 x\n^   ^ ^ ^    ^ ^ ^\n```\n\n## More examples\n\n```\nswap(\"gOOd MOrniNg\", 7864)        -->  \"GooD MorNIng\"\nswap(\"\", 11345)                   -->  \"\"\nswap(\"the lord of the rings\", 0)  -->  \"the lord of the rings\"\n```",
