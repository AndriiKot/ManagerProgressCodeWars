  "description": "For this challenge you need to create a UNION statement, there are two tables `ussales` and `eusales` the parent company tracks each sale at its respective location in each table, you must all filter the sale price so it only returns rows with a sale greater than `50.00`. You have been tasked with combining that data for future analysis. Order by location (US before EU), then by id.\n\n### (us/eu)sales table schema\n- id\n- name\n- price\n- card_name\n- card_number\n- transaction_date\n\n### resultant table schema\n- location (EU for eusales and US for ussales)\n- id\n- name\n- price (greater than 50.00)\n- card_name\n- card_number\n- transaction_date\n\n> NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.",
