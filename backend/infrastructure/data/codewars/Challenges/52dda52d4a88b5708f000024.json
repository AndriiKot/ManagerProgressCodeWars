  "description": "**Introduction**\n\nOrdinal numbers are used to tell the position of something in a list. Unlike regular numbers, they have a special suffix added to the end of them.\n\n\n**Task**\n\nYour task is to write the `ordinal(number, brief)` function. `number` will be an integer. You need to find the ordinal suffix of said number.\n\n`brief` is an optional parameter and defaults to `false`. When using brief notation, `nd` and `rd` use `d` instead. All others are the same.\n\n`ordinal(number, brief)` should return a string containing those two characters (or one character) that would be tagged onto the end of the number.\n\nThe last two digits determine the ordinal suffix.\n\n**Notation for general notation**\n<pre>\n0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\nth st nd rd th th th th th th\n</pre>\n\n**Notation for brief notation**\n<pre>\n0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\nth st d  d th th th th th th\n</pre>\n\n**However, when the last two digits of the number are 11, 12, or 13, `th` is used instead of `st`,`nd`,`rd` respectively.**\n\n**Examples**\n<pre>\n*General\n1 - 1st\n2 - 2nd\n3 - 3rd\n5 - 5th\n11- 11th\n149 - 149th\n903 - 903rd\n</pre>\n<pre>\n*Brief\n1 - 1st\n2 - 2d\n3 - 3d\n5 - 5th\n11- 11th\n149 - 149th\n903 - 903d\n</pre>\n\n**Notes**\n\n- Numbers might be passed in replacement of booleans, so `false` may be passed in as `0` and true may be passed in as `1`.",
