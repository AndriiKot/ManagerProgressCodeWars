  "description": "John wants to decorate the walls of a room with wallpaper.\nHe wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.\n\nJohn knows that the rectangular room has a length of `l` meters, a width of `w` meters, a height of `h` meters.\nThe standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is `52` centimeters. The \nlength of a roll is `10` meters.\nHe bears in mind however, that it’s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length `15%` greater than the one he needs.\n\nLast time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John? \n\n#### Task\nYour function `wallpaper(l, w, h)` should return as a plain English word\nin lower case the number of rolls he must buy.\n\n#### Example:\n\n`wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return \"ten\"`\n\n`wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return \"zero\"`\n\n#### Notes:\n\n- all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge \n- 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers); it can happens that `w * h * l` is zero\n- the integer `r` (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20\n\n- FORTH: the number of rolls will be a *positive or null integer* (not a plain English word; this number can be greater than 20)\n\n- In Coffeescript, Javascript, Python, Ruby and Scala the English numbers are preloaded and can be accessed as:\n```\nnumbers = [\"zero\", \"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\", \"seven\", \"eight\", \"nine\", \"ten\", \"eleven\", \"twelve\",\"thirteen\", \"fourteen\", \"fifteen\", \"sixteen\", \"seventeen\", \"eighteen\", \"nineteen\", \"twenty\"]\n```\n\n- For other languages it is not preloaded and you can instead copy the above list if you desire.\n\n",
