  "description": "Given a list of longs, you must calculate and return the sum of all those that are prime relative (or coprime) to any other in the list.\n\nTwo integers are relatively prime (or coprime) if there is no integer greater than one that divides them both (that is, their greatest common divisor is one). For example, 12 and 13 are relatively prime, but 12 and 14 are not.\n\nFor example given a list with [10,7,8,11,5] the result is 11+7 =18 because 10 and 5 are not coprime (%5) and neither are 8 and 10 (%2).\n\nValue 1 is not permited and the size of the list is at least 2.\n\nIt must work with large divisors and efficiency is a important fact.",
