  "description": "\n### Description\nYou are using a search engine and type some keywords. For the sake of simplicity, we simplify all the keywords into one letter. For example, \"abc\" represents three keywords: a, b and c. We have a lot of search results, please pick out the results that contain all the keywords.\n\nExample:\n```\nkeywords=\"abc\", searchResult=[\"ab\",\"abc\",\"abcd\",\"bcd\"]\nYou should return: [\"abc\",\"abcd\"]\n```\nKey words can have different order, also may not be continuous and You don't need to sort them out or to remove the same result:\n```\nkeywords=\"abc\", \nsearchResult=[\"ab\",\"cba\",\"abc\",\"axbxc\",\"ddd\",\"abc\",\"cxab\",\"aabbcc\"]\nYou should return: [\"cba\",\"abc\",\"axbxc\",\"abc\",\"cxab\",\"aabbcc\"]\n```\nKey words may contains uppercase letters:\n```\nkeywords=\"Yes\", \nsearchResult=[\"yes\",\"Yes\",\"Yeah\",\"Yestoday\"]\nYou should return: [\"Yes\",\"Yestoday\"]\n```\nOK, that's all. I guess this is a 7kyu kata. If you agree, please rank it as 7kyu and vote `very`;-) If you think this kata is too easy or too hard, please `shame me` by rank it as you want and vote `somewhat` or `none` :[\n\n### Task\nComplete function `finalResult` that accepts two arguments `keywords` and `searchResult`, return all valid results that contains all keywords.\n\n Argument `keywords` is always a string that contains uppercase or lowercase letters; Argument `searchResult` is always a string array that contains any strings.\n",
