  "description": "### Help Kiyo きよ solve her problems LCM Fun!\n\nKiyo has been given a series of problems and she needs your help to \nsolve them!\n\nYou will be given a two-dimensional array such as the one below.\n\n```\na = \n[\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n]\n\nRemove everything but odd integers from each sub-array.\n\nSum the remaining odd integers of each sub-array. \n\nSum of odds ( a[0] = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 ) = 25\n       \nFind the Least common multiple of the arrays.\n\n (25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25)\n  ^                                ^ \n  |                                |\na[0]-----------------------------a[8]\n\nexample : lcm( 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25 ) = 25\n\nexample : lcm( 37, 29, 19, 38, 31, 28, 15, 24, 9 ) = 1592632440\n\n```\nIntegers are between 0 and 9. Sub-array size is always 9. The number of sub-arrays varies between 9 and 18. \n\nWatch out for non-integers mixed in the arrays. If all arrays are empty return 0.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple",
