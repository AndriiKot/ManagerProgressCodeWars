  "description": "The Ackermann function is a famous function that played a big role in computability theory as the first example of a total computable function that is not primitive recursive.\n\nSince then the function has been a bit simplified but is still of good use. Due to its definition in terms of extremely deep recursion it can be used as a benchmark of a compiler's ability to optimize recursion. \n\nThe goal of this kata is to code a function which will be given two inputs, m and n, and will return the Ackermann number A(m,n) defined by:\n\n```\nA(m,n) = n+1                          if m=0  \nA(m,n) = A(m-1,1)                     if m>0 , n=0\nA(m,n) = A(m-1,A(m,n-1))              if m,n > 0\n```\n\n~~~if-not:c\n`m`,`n` should be non-negative integers, the function should return null (Javascript, Dart), None (Python), or nil (Ruby) for other type, non-integer and negative numbers. In C, input is restricted to integer type.\n~~~\n\n~~~if:c\nIf m or n is negative, return -1.\n~~~\n",
