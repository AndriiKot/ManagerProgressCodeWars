  "description": "An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.\n\n```if-not:rust\nExample: \n - The starting array sequence is `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`\n - The mixed array with one deleted number is `[3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]`\n - Your function should return the int `5`.\n \nIf no number was deleted from the starting array, your function should return the int `0`.\n```\n\n```if:rust\nExample: \n - The starting array sequence is `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`\n - The mixed array with one deleted number is `[3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]`\n - Your function should return `Some(5)`.\n \nIf no number was deleted from the starting list, your function should return `None`.\n```\n\n**Note**: N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be `[]`).",
