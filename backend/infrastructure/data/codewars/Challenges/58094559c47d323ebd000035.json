  "description": "For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the `people` table, and join to the `sales` table so that you can return the COUNT of all sales and RANK each person by their sale_count.\n\n### people table schema\n- id\n- name\n\n### sales table schema\n- id\n- people_id\n- sale\n- price\n\nYou should return all people fields as well as the sale count as \"sale_count\" and the rank as \"sale_rank\".\n\n> NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.",
