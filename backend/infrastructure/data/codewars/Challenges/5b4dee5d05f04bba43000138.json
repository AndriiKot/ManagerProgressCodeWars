  "description": "The ```digit root``` of a number ```(dr)``` is the sum of the digits of a number.\nFor example, the integer ```749```, has a digit root equals to ```20```.\n\nIn effect: ```7 + 4 + 9 = 20```.\n\nWe define here the ```deeper square double digit root``` of an integer ```n```, ```(dsddr)```, the sum of the squares of every digit of the digit root of ```n```.\n\nThe ```dsddr``` of ```749``` will be ```4```:\n2<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> = 4\n\nWe define the function ```f```, like:\n```\nf(n) = dr(n) + dsddr(n) \n```\nNow we receive two arrays of positive integers, ``` arr1``` , ```arr2``` of different lengths. They have common elements. The task is to output an array, res, with the common elements occurring once and sorted by their corresponding value of f in descending order. If there is a coincidence in the value of f(res[i]), the lowest number goes first.\n\nExample:\n``` \narr1 = [5, 56, 28, 35, 12, 27, 64, 99, 18, 31, 14, 6]\narr2 = [28, 17, 31, 63, 64, 5, 18, 17, 95, 56, 37, 5, 28, 16]\n``` \nThe common elements of arr1 and arr2 are:\n```[64, 5, 18, 56, 28, 31]``` \n\nThe table for their corresponding value of f is:\n``` \nn        f(n)\n64        11\n 5        30\n18        90\n56        13\n28        11\n31        20\n``` \nSo the output will be:\n```[18, 5, 31, 56, 28, 64]``` \n\nYou do not have to worry about the inputs, arr1 and arr2, will be always valid arrays and all of their terms, positive integers.\n\nFeatures of the random tests:\n```\nlengths of arrays for the input up to 500.000.\nThe values of the integers between 1 and 1.500.000\nAmount of tests almost 150\n```\nSee more examples in the Example tests",
