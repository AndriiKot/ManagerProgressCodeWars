  "description": "Mad Libs is a game where you switch out words in a sentence.\n\nFor this kata, you will create a method `madlib(name)` for `String` objects that replaces every 3rd person singular pronoun (case insensitive) with `name`.\n\nThe pronouns are:\n- He\n- She\n- It\n- Her\n- Him\n\nFor example:\n\n```ruby\n\"He is short\".madlib(\"Bob\")\n=> \"Bob is short\"\n\n\"I gave it a round of applause\".madlib(\"the show\")\n=> \"I gave the show a round of applause\"\n\n\"I high-fived her\".madlib(\"your mom\")\n=> \"I high-fived your mom\"\n\n\"It fell on it's face\".madlib(\"chuck Norris\")\n=> \"Chuck Norris fell on chuck Norris's face\"\n```\n\nNotes:\n\n* The first character of the resulting string should be capitalized.\n* Do not mutate the original object, return a fresh one.",
