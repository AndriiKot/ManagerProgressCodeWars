  "description": "Task\n=======\n\nMake a custom esolang interpreter for the language Tick. Tick is a descendant of [Ticker](https://www.codewars.com/kata/esolang-ticker) but also very different data and command-wise.\n\nSyntax/Info\n========\n\nCommands are given in character format. Non-command characters should be ignored. Tick has an potentially infinite memory as opposed to Ticker(which you have a special command to add a new cell) and only has 4 commands(as opposed to 7). Read about this esolang [here](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Tick).\n\nCommands\n========\n\n`>`: Move data selector right\n\n`<`: Move data selector left(infinite in both directions)\n\n`+`: Increment memory cell by 1. 255+1=0\n\n`*`: Add ascii value of memory cell to the output tape.\n\nExamples\n========\n\n**Hello world!**\n\n```\n'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++**>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*<<*>>>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*<<<<*>>>>>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*'\n```",
