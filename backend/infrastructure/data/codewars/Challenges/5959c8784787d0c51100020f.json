  "description": "**Get Indices of Item Weights**\n\nGiven a package with a weight limit ```limit``` and an array ```arr``` of item weights, implement a method (ruby)/function (javascript) that finds two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit ```limit```. Your method/function should return a pair ```ex. [i, j]``` of the indices of the item weights. If such a pair doesn’t exist, return ```nil/null```.\n\n\n**Challenge Complete in under ```O(n^2) a.k.a. quadratic time complexity```**\n\n**Constraints: Returned Array elements could not be the same index position\nso ```[1, 1]``` would not be acceptable...**\n\nReturn the first pair, a.k.a lexographically speaking, that sums up to the ```limit```\n\n[input] array.integer arr  ```2 ≤ arr.length ≤ 100```\n\n[input] integer limit\n\n[output] array.integer",
