  "description": "# <span style='color:orange'>Background</span>\n\nIt is the middle of the night.\n\nYou are jet-lagged from your long cartesian plane trip, and find yourself in a rental car office in an unfamiliar city.\n\nYou have no idea how to get to your hotel. \n\nOh, and it's raining. \n\nCould you be any more miserable?\n\nBut the friendly rental-car dude behind the desk says not to worry! He kindly pre-programs the car **Sat Nav** system with your destination. He smiles and assures you that the device works OK. What excellent service! What a nice man! \n\nMaybe things are not so bad after all.\n\nThen he sniggers...\n\n\n# <span style='color:orange'>City streets</span>\n\nThe city extends as far as the eye can see in all directions, and is laid out as a giant grid where all blocks are `1km` across.\n\nNotice that [x,y] coordinates are described with units of `100m`\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6MFbhPO.png\" title=\"satnav city streets\" />\n\n\n# <span style='color:orange'>Kata task</span>\n\nYour starting point is `[0,0]`\n\nSimply follow the Sat Nav directions!\n\nWhen you arrive at the destination return the final [x,y] coordinates.\n\n# <span style='color:orange'>Sat Nav directions</span>\n\nThe device gives directions as text messages:\n\n<span style='color:red'>*The first message*</span>\n* `Head <NORTH,EAST,SOUTH,WEST>`\n \n<span style='color:red'>*The en-route messages*</span>\n* `Take the <NEXT,2nd,3rd,4th,5th> <LEFT,RIGHT>`\n* `Go straight on for <100,200,300,...,900>m`\n* `Go straight on for <1.0,1.1,1.2,...,5.0>km`\n* `Turn around!`\n\n<span style='color:red'>*The last message*</span>\n* `You have reached your destination!`\n\n<span style='color:orange'>NOTES</span>\n* First and last messages are always present\n* There may be any number of *en-route* messages\n* Messages are always formatted corrrectly\n* A `NEXT` turn message means you must to proceed to the *next* cross-street even if you are currently at an intersection\n* But `Turn around` does not need to be done at an intersection. Just do a U-turn wherever you are!\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n<span style='color:gray'>Good Luck!<br/>DM</span>\n\n",
