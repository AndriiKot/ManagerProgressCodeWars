  "description": "I need to save some money to buy a gift. I think I can do something like that:\n\nFirst week (W0) I save nothing on Sunday, 1 on Monday, 2 on Tuesday... 6 on Saturday,\nsecond week (W1) 2 on Monday... 7 on Saturday and so on according to the table below where the days are numbered from 0 to 6.\n\nCan you tell me how much I will have for my gift on Saturday evening after I have saved 12? (Your function finance(6) should return 168 which is the sum of the savings in the table). \n\nImagine now that we live on planet XY140Z-n where the days of the week are numbered from 0 to n (integer n > 0) and where\nI save from week number 0 to week number n included (in the table below n = 6).\n\nHow much money would I have at the end of my financing plan on planet XY140Z-n?\n\n\n\n  -- |Su|Mo|Tu|We|Th|Fr|Sa|\n   --|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n  W6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |12|\n  W5 |  |  |  |  |  |10|11|\n  W4 |  |  |  |  |8 |9 |10|\n  W3 |  |  |  |6 |7 |8 |9 |\n  W2 |  |  |4 |5 |6 |7 |8 |\n  W1 |  |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 |7 |\n  W0 |0 |1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 |\n  \n#### Example:\n```\nfinance(5) --> 105\nfinance(6) --> 168\nfinance(7) --> 252\nfinance(5000) --> 62537505000\n```\n#### Note: \nyour solution will be nicer without loops.\n",
