  "description": "## Task\n\nFind the sum of the first `n` elements in the Recamán Sequence.\n\nInput range:\n\n```javascript\n1000 tests\n0 <= n <= 1,000,000\n```\n```python\n1000 tests\n0 <= n <= 2,500,000\n```\n```haskell\n0 <= n <= 1 000 000\n1 000 tests\n```\n\n---\n\n## Sequence\n\nThe sequence is formed using the next formula:\n\n* We start with `0`\n* At each step `i`, we subtract `i` from the previous number\n* If the result is not negative, and not yet present in the sequence, it becomes the `i`th element of the sequence\n* Otherwise the `i`th element of the sequence will be previous number plus `i`\n\nThe beginning of the sequence is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 2, ...]` because:  \n\n0) `0` <- we start with `0`\n1) `1` <- `0 - 1` is negative, hence we choose `0 + 1`\n2) `3` <- `1 - 2` is negative, hence we choose `1 + 2`\n3) `6` <-`3 - 3` is not negative, but we already have a `0` in the sequence, hence we choose `3 + 3`\n4) `2` <- `6 - 4` is positive, and is not present in the sequence yet, so we go for it\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nrec(0) == 0\nrec(1) == 0\nrec(2) == 1\nrec(3) == 4\nrec(4) == 10\nrec(5) == 12\n```",
