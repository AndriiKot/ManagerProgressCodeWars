  "description": "Write a function that takes as its parameters *one or more numbers which are the diameters of circles.* \n\nThe function should return the *total area of all the circles*, rounded to the nearest integer in a string that says \"We have this much circle: xyz\". \n\nYou don't know how many circles you will be given, but you can assume it will be at least one.\n\nSo: \n```javascript\nsumCircles(2) == \"We have this much circle: 3\"\nsumCircles(2, 3, 4) == \"We have this much circle: 23\"\n```\n```python\nsum_circles(2) == \"We have this much circle: 3\"\nsum_circles(2, 3, 4) == \"We have this much circle: 23\"\n```\n```ruby\nsum_circles(2) == \"We have this much circle: 3\"\nsum_circles(2, 3, 4) == \"We have this much circle: 23\"\n```\n\nTranslations and comments (and upvotes!) welcome!",
