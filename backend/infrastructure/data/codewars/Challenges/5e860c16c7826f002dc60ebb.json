  "description": "## **Task**\n\nYou are given a positive integer (`n`), and your task is to find the largest number **less than** `n`, which can be written in the form `a**b`, where `a` can be any non-negative integer and `b` is an integer greater than or equal to `2`. Try not to make the code time out :)\n\nThe input range is from `1` to `1,000,000`.\n\n## **Return**\n\nReturn your answer in the form `(x, y)` or (`[x, y]`, depending on the language ), where `x` is the value of `a**b`, and `y` is the number of occurrences of `a**b`. By the way ** means ^ or power, so 2 ** 4 = 16.\nIf you are given a number less than or equal to `4`, that is not `1`, return `(1, -1)`, because there is an infinite number of values for it: `1**2, 1**3, 1**4, ...`.  \nIf you are given `1`, return `(0, -1)`.\n\n## **Examples**\n\n```\n 3  -->  (1, -1)  # because it's less than 4\n 6  -->  (4, 1)   # because the largest such number below 6 is 4,\n                  # and there is only one way to write it: 2**2\n65  -->  (64, 3)  # because there are three occurrences of 64: 2**6, 4**3, 8**2\n90  -->  (81, 2)  # because the largest such number below 90 is 81,\n                  # and there are two ways of getting it: 3**4, 9**2\n```\nBy the way, after finishing this kata, please try some of my other katas: [here.](https://www.codewars.com/collections/tonylicodings-authored-katas)",
