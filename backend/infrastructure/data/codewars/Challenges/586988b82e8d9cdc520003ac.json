  "description": "You're operating behind enemy lines, but your decryption device took a bullet and no longer operates.  You need to write a code to unscramble the encrypted messages coming in from headquarters.  Luckily, you remember how the encryption algorithm works.\n\nEach message you receive is a single string, with the blocks for each letter separated by a space. The blocks encoding the characters are made up of seemingly random characters and are of a variable length. For example, a two character word might look like:\n```python\n\"x20*6<xY y_r9L\"\n```\nTo decode this string, you add up only the numbers in each block:\n```python\nsum of integers in \"x20*6<xY\" --> 2 + 0 + 6 = 8\nsum of integers in \"y_r9L\" --> 9\n```\nThen map these numbers to the corresponding letters of the alphabet, with 0 representing a space:\n```python\n0  : ' '\n1  : 'a'\n2  : 'b'\n...\n26 : 'z'\n```\nSo we have:\n```python\n\"x20*6<xY y_r9L\" --> \"8 9\" --> \"hi\"\n```\nNote also, if the sum of the digits goes over 26, loop back to zero (standard modulo / remainder function, such that 27 == 0, 28 == 1, etc.). As such the previous code could have also been:\n```python\n\"x20*6<xY y875_r97L\" --> \"8 36\" --> \"8 9\" --> \"hi\"\n```\n",
