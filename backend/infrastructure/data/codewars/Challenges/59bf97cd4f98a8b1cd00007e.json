  "description": "Consider the following:\n\n* The divisors of `6` are: `1, 2, 3 & 6` and their sum is `12`. Now, `12/6 = 2`.\n* The divisors of `28` are `1, 2, 4, 7, 14 & 28` and their sum is `56`. Now, `56/28 = 2`.\n* The divisors of `496` are `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124, 248, 496` and their sum is `992`. Now, `992/496 = 2`.\n\nWe shall say that `(6,28,496)` is a grouping with a ratio of `2`.  \n\nSimilarly, consider the grouping `(30,140)`: \n* The divisors of `30` are: `1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15 & 30` and their sum is `72`. Now, `72/30 = 12/5 = 2.4`.\n* The divisors of `140` are `1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 28, 35, 70, 140` and their sum is `336`. Now, `336/140 = 12/5 = 2.4`.\n\nWe shall say that `(30,140)` is a grouping with a ratio of `12/5`. \n\n`(6,28)` and `(30,140)` are the only groupings in which `every member of a group is 0 <= n < 200`. The sum of the smallest members of each group is `6 + 30 = 36`. \n\nGiven a `range(a,b),` return the sum of the smallest members of each group. As illustrated above:\n* every member of a group must be greater than or equal to `a` and less than `b`. \n* a group must have `2` or more members. \n\n```\nExamples:\nsolve(1,200) = 36, the sum of [6,30] as explained above\nsolve(1,250) = 168, the sum of [6, 12, 30, 40, 80]\nsolve(1,500) = 498, the sum of [6, 12, 30, 40, 66, 78, 80, 84, 102]\n\nAs you can see, for \"solve(1,500)\", we do not include all (6,28) & (6,496) & (28,496). We count the group once by including 6 only.\n```\n\nIf there are no groups, return `0`. Upper limit is `2000`.\n\nGood luck!\n\nif you like this Kata, please try:\n\n[Simple division](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59ec2d112332430ce9000005)\n\n[Sub-array division](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59eb64cba954273cd4000099)",
