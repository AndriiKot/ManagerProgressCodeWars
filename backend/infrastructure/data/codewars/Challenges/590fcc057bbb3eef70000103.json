  "description": "# Task\nA new parking lot just opened in your city. Its rates are:\n```\n- The first 30 minutes (inclusive) of parking are free;\n- From 31 minutes to 2 hours, every 10 minutes costs $1;\n- Every 10 minutes over 2 hours costs $2.```\nSince you are charged for every `10` minutes, you should round the number \nof minutes spent in the parking lot up to the `nearest multiple of 10`. For example, if you've been in the parking lot for `43` minutes, you will pay for `50` minutes.\n\nYou are given 2 strings: The time you typically arrive at your usual parking lot, and the time you typically leave it. Now you want to know how much you'll have to pay at the new parking lot.\n\nIf `timeOut` is earlier than `timeIn`, you can assume that `timeOut` is on the next day.\n\n\n\n# Input/Output\n\n`[input]` string `timeIn`\n\nThe time you usually arrive at the parking lot, in the format hh:mm.\n\n`[input]` string `timeOut`\n\nThe time you usually leave the parking lot, in the format hh:mm.\n\n`[output]` an integer\n\nThe number of dollars you'll need to pay.\n\n\n# Example\n\nFor `timeIn = \"14:11\" and timeOut = \"14:39\"`, the output should be `0`.\n\nYou usually spend `28` minutes in the parking lot, so you won't have to pay anything.\n\nFor `timeIn = \"07:02\" and timeOut = \"07:42\"`, the output should be `1`.\n\nYou spend `40` minutes in the parking lot, so you'll need to pay for the first `10` minutes after the free half hour.\n\nFor `timeIn = \"12:20\" and timeOut = \"14:54\"`, the output should be `17`.\n\nYou spend `2 hours and 34 minutes` in the parking lot, so you'll need to pay `$9` for the first `2 hours` (there are 90 minutes between `30 minutes` and `2 hours`, each `10` minutes of which cost `$1`) and `4 * 2 = $8` for the next 34 minutes, for a total of `8 + 9 = 17`.\n\nFor `timeIn = \"23:50\" and timeOut = \"00:30\"`, the output should be `1`.\n\nYou spend `40` minutes in the parking lot, so you'll need to pay for the first `10` minutes after the free half hour.",
