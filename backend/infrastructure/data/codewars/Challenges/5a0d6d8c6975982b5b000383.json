Both are years, and indicates a range.\n\nYour work is to return the number of times a month ends with a Friday. \n\nIf there is only one year provided, return the number of times a month ends on Friday on that year. Range bounds are inclusive in every case!\n\nFor example, between 1901 and 2000, a month ends on Friday 171 times.",
