  "description": "In this Kata, you will validate a NIF, which consists of an ID that allows people to be identified to carry out commercial activities in Spain.\n\nGiven an string of letter/s and numbers, return ```True``` if it is a valid NIF, and ```False``` if is not.\n\nA NIF is valid if:\n* Contains exactly 8 digits and 1 letter, in that order.\n* The letter is capital letter.\n* The result of the modulus of **the number composed by the digits** and **23** is equal to the index of the letter of the NIF, within this string: ```\"TRWAGMYFPDXBNJZSQVHLCKE\"```\n**Examples**\n* ```39961129D``` is valid\n  * 39961129 % 23 = 9\n  * 'D' is at the index ```9``` of the letters.\n  ```\"TRWAGMYFPDXBNJZSQVHLCKE\"```\n* ```64942774W``` is not valid\n  * 64942774 % 23 = 20\n  * 'W' is not at the index ```20```, 'C' would be the correct letter for this NIF instead.\n                              ",
