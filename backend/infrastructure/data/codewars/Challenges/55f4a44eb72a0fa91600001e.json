  "description": "Implement a function that receives a string, and lets you extend it with repeated calls. When no argument is passed you should return a string consisting of space-separated words you've received earlier.\n\n**Note**: There will always be at least 1 string; all inputs will be non-empty.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\ncreateMessage(\"Hello\")(\"World!\")(\"how\")(\"are\")(\"you?\")() === \"Hello World! how are you?\"\n```\n```python\ncreate_message(\"Hello\")(\"World!\")(\"how\")(\"are\")(\"you?\")() == \"Hello World! how are you?\"\n```\n\nTip (helpful, but not necessary): Try using classes! \n\nGood luck and happy coding!",
