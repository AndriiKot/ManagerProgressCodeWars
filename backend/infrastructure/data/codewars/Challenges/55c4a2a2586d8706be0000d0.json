  "description": "### Background\n\nIn the world of investment banking, when the quantities bought and sold are so large that pricing is significant at less then the smallest available unit of 'real' currency.\n\nThis is why you'll often see things quoted with a pair of buy-sell prices for a single producty that are less than a cent.\n\nOnce of the niceties of trading this way is a format to display these extra small fractions.  By convention, some products will be quoted not to decimal places, but to pre-agreed fractions.\n\nFor example, if a product is quoted to the 16th of a cent you might see a price displayed like this: `109.28/7` which means $109.28 <sup>7</sup>/<sub>16</sub>\n\nInternally within these systems the price will still be in cents and fractions of a cent like so: `10928.4375`.\n\n### Kata\n\nIn this kata you must write a class to convert between internal and display values.\n\nWhen constructed the class is supplied with the fractional denominator to be used in the conversion, if none is supplied, use `16` as a default.\n\n**Note:** You can assume that all inputs are valid for conversion.  Further, all denominators will be a power of two so no need to worry about floating point approximations.",
