The order of the currency strength is as follows:\n\n\"EUR\", \"GBP\", \"AUD\", \"NZD\", \"USD\", \"CAD\", \"CHF\", \"JPY\"\n\nSo for AUD the currency matrix would be as follows\nEURAUD, GBPAUD, AUDNZD, AUDUSD, AUDCAD, AUDCHF, AUDJPY\n\nYour goal is to generate this currency matrix for a given currency. You can assume that the passed in currency is a valid one.",
