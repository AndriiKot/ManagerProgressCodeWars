  "description": "Adding tip to a restaurant bill in a graceful way can be tricky, thats why you need make a function for it.\n\nThe function will receive the restaurant bill (always a positive number) as an argument. You need to 1) **add at least 15%** in tip, 2) round that number up to an *elegant* value and 3) return it.\n\nWhat is an *elegant* number? It depends on the magnitude of the number to be rounded. Numbers below 10 should simply be rounded to whole numbers. Numbers 10 and above should be rounded like this:\n\n10 - 99.99... ---> Round to number divisible by 5\n\n100 - 999.99... ---> Round to number divisible by 50\n\n1000 - 9999.99... ---> Round to number divisible by 500\n\nAnd so on...\n\nGood luck!\n\n## Examples\n```\n 1  -->    2\n 7  -->    9\n12  -->   15\n86  -->  100\n```",
