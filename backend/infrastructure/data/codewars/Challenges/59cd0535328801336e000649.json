  "description": "**Simple interest** on a loan is calculated by simply taking the initial amount (the principal, `p`) and multiplying it by a rate of interest (`r`) and the number of time periods (`n`). \n\n**Compound interest** is calculated by adding the interest after each time period to the amount owed, then calculating the next interest payment based on the principal PLUS the interest from all previous periods.\n\nGiven a principal *p*, interest rate *r*, and a number of periods *n*, return an array `[ total owed under simple interest, total owed under compound interest ]`\n\n**Notes:**\n* Round all answers to the nearest integer\n* Principal will always be an integer between 0 and 9999\n* interest rate will be a decimal between 0 and 1\n* number of time periods will be an integer between 0 and 50 \n\n\n## Examples\n\n```\ninterest(100, 0.1,  1)  =  [110, 110]\ninterest(100, 0.1,  2)  =  [120, 121]\ninterest(100, 0.1, 10)  =  [200, 259]\n```\n  \n---\n\nMore on [Simple interest, compound interest and continuous interest](https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-simple-compound-and-continuous-interest-rates/)\n",
