  "description": "Your task is to write an SQL query for a PostgreSQL database. The database includes a table named `split_titles`, which consists of titles as concatenated strings. Each string is comprised of elements separated exclusively by the '+' character. Your objective is to extract the last element from each concatenated string in the title column. If the title does not contain the '+' symbol, display `NULL` for the last part.\n\n`split_titles`:\n\n* `id` (int): primary key\n* `title`: (string): Contains concatenated titles separated by '+'\n\nRequirements:\n\n1) Write an SQL query to select each title from the `split_titles` table.\n2) Extract and display the last element from each `title` after splitting it by the '+' character.\n3) If the `title` does not contain the '+' symbol, display NULL as the `last_part`.\n4) Order the results by the `id` column in descending order.\n5) Your result set should include two columns:\n    * The original `title`.\n    * The extracted last element or NULL, labeled as `last_part`.\n    \n  \n#### Desired Output\n\nThe desired output should look like this:\n\n<table><!----><tr><th>title</th><th>last_part</th></tr><tr><td>HHHH</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>F+G+H+I</td><td>I</td></tr><tr><td>D+EEE</td><td>EEE</td></tr><tr><td>A+B+CC</td><td>CC</td></tr></table>\n",
