  "description": "You are given a matrix ```M```, of positive and negative integers. It should be sorted in an up and down column way, starting always with the lowest element placed at the top left position finishing with the highest depending on ```n``` value: at the bottom right position if the number of columns,```n```,  is odd, or placed at the top right, if ```n``` is even.\n\nE.g.:\n```\nM = [[-20, -4, -1],\n     [  1,  4,  7], \n     [  8, 10, 12]]\n     \nM_ = [[-20, 7, 8],\n      [-4, 4, 10],\n      [-1, 1, 12]]\n```      \nIn order to be more understandable we show the directions of the sorting for the new matrix with arrows:\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/owCZAeI\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/owCZAeI.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nCreate the function ```up_down_col_sort()``` that receives a matrix as an argument and may do this kind of sorting.\n\nYour function will be tested with square or rectangular matrices of ```m``` rows and ```n``` columns\nFeatures of the random tests:\n```\nNumber of tests = 120\n10 <= m <= 200\n10 <= n <= 200\n-1000 <= M[i,j] <= 1000\n```\nThe kata is available at Python 2, Typescript, Javascript and Ruby at the moment.\nTranslations into another languages will be released soon.\n     \n",
