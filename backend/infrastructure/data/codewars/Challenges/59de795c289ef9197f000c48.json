  "description": "It happened decades before Snapchat, years before Twitter and even before Facebook. Targeted advertising was a bit of a challenge back then. One day, the marketing professor at my university told us a story that I am yet to confirm using reliable sources. Nevertheless, I retold the story to dozens of my students already, so, sorry BMW if it is all a big lie.\n\nAllegedly, BMW, in an attempt to target the educated, produced billboard posters featuring the English alphabet with three letters missing: B, M and W. Needless to say, many were confused, some to the extent of road accidents.\n\nYour task is to write a function that takes one parameter str that MUST be a string and removes all capital and small letters B, M and W.  \nIf data of the wrong data type was sent as a parameter the function must throw an error with the following specific message: \n\n```python\nTypeError(\"This program only works for text.\")\n```\n```javascript\nnew Error(\"This program only works for text.\");\n```\n```ruby\n\"This program only works for text.\"\n```\n```groovy\nnew IllegalArgumentException(\"This program only works for text.\")\n```\n\nFor Python [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html)'s a good resource you might need for the exception type ;) \n",
