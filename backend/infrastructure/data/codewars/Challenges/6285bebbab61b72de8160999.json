The catch with this kata though is that it uses`channels` to communicate with your Solution rather than the typical single function call and return.\n\n\n## Details\n\n### Customer Dialogue:\n- The customer will always open the conversation with `place an order`\n- The customer may ask for a `price {item}`\n- The customer confirms they want an item by saying `order {item}`\n- The customer may ask for an item that is not on the menu\n- The order ends when the customer says `that is all`\n\n### Expected Responses:\n- Respond with `ok` for\n  - `place an order`\n  - `order {item}` - (`unavailable` if not on the menu)\n- Respond with the price as a string for\n  - `price {item}` - (`unavailable` if not on the menu)\n  - `that is all`\n- Respond to `goodbye` with `goodbye`\n\n### When to stop\nYou should continue to take orders until you receive on the `done` channel. You can assume that you will not receive on the `done` channel while you are also receiving on `hear`, it is one or the other. You can also assume that you won't receive on `done` in the middle of an order.\n\n### Example Phone Call\nEach newline is a receive on the `hear` channel, tabbed in lines are responses\n```\nplace an order\n    ok\nprice chicken bento box\n    12.99\nprice spring roll\n    1.99\norder spring roll\n    ok\norder spring roll\n    ok\norder chicken bento box\n    ok\nprice pizza\n    unavailable\nthat is all\n    16.97\ngoodbye\n    goodbye\n```",
