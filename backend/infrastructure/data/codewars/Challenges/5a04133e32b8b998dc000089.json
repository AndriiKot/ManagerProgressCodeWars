  "description": "An element in an array is dominant if it is greater than all elements to its right. You will be given an array and your task will be to return a list of all dominant elements. For example:\n```\nsolve([1,21,4,7,5]) = [21,7,5] because 21, 7 and 5 are greater than elments to their right. \nsolve([5,4,3,2,1]) = [5,4,3,2,1]\n\nNotice that the last element is always included. All numbers will be greater than 0.\n```\n\nMore examples in the test cases.\n\nGood luck!",
