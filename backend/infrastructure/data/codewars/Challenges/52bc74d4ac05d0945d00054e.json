  "description": "Write a function named `first_non_repeating_letter`<sup>†</sup> that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.\n\nFor example, if given the input `'stress'`, the function should return `'t'`, since the letter *t* only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string.\n\nAs an added challenge, upper- and lowercase letters are considered the **same character**, but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter.  For example, the input `'sTreSS'` should return `'T'`.\n\n~~~if-not:rust\nIf a string contains *all repeating characters*, it should return an empty string (`\"\"`);\n~~~\n~~~if:rust\nIf a string contains *all repeating characters*, it should return `None`.\n~~~\n\n<sup>†</sup> Note: the function is called `firstNonRepeatingLetter` for historical reasons, but your function should handle any Unicode character.\n",
