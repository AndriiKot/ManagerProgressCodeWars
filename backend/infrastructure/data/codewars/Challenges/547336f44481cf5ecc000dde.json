After how many years will his birthday fall on Friday again? (That would be 11 years)\n```if:javascript\n## Note\n\nMonth is zero-indexed\n```\n```javascript\nnextBirthdayOfTheWeek(new Date(1990, 9, 16)) //11\nnextBirthdayOfTheWeek(new Date(2012, 5, 20))  //6\nnextBirthdayOfTheWeek(new Date(1975, 2, 22))  //5\n```\n```ruby\nnext_birthday_of_the_week(Date.new(1990, 10, 16)) # 11\nnext_birthday_of_the_week(Date.new(2012, 5, 20))  # 6\nnext_birthday_of_the_week(Date.new(1975, 2, 22))  # 5\n```\n\n\n",
