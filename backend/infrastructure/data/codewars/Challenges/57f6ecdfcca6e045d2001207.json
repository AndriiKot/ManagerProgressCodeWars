  "description": "Write a function that will compare two values, one will be a number and one will be a string. Return ```true``` if they are the same character (regardless of their different data types) and return ```false``` if they are not.\n\nTo make this challange harder and to promp the challenger to read up about coercion I have disabled some of the built in methods including ```.toString()```, ```.join()```, ```.split()```, ```parseInt``` and ```.Number()```.",
