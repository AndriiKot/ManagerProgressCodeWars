  "description": "This kata is inspired by [problem #50 from Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=50). \n\nThe prime `$41$` is the sum of many consecutive primes:\n\n`$41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13$`\n\nFurthermore, `$41$` is the prime `$p \\mid p \\lt 100$` with the longest chain of consecutive prime addends (6 addends).\n\nFor primes `$p \\mid p \\lt 500$`, the prime with the largest chain of consecutive prime addends is `$499$` with 17 addends.\n\n`$499 = 3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23+29+31+37+41+43+47+53+59+61$`\n\nWrite a function that takes an integer `$n$` as an argument and returns a sorted list of prime numbers `$p \\mid p \\lt n$` that have the longest chain of consecutive prime addends.\n\nLet's see some cases (Input -> Output):\n\n```\n* 100 -> [41]\n* 500 -> [499]\n* 499 -> [379, 491]\n```\n\nRandom tests use values of `$n$` in the range `$100 \\le n \\le 500000$`\n\nEnjoy it!",
