  "description": "The number 1089 is the smallest one, non palindromic,  that has the same prime factors that its reversal.\nThus,\n```python\nprime factorization of 1089 with 3, 3, 11, 11 -------> 3, 11\n\nprime factorization of 9801 with  3, 3, 3, 3, 11, 11 -------> 3, 11\n```\nThe task for this kata is to create a function same_factRev(), that receives a nMax, to find all the numbers with the above property, bellow nMax.\n\nthe function same_factRev(), will output a sorted list with the found numbers bellow nMax\n\nLet'se some cases\n```python\nsame_factRev(1100) -----> [1089]\n\nsame_factRev(2500) -----> [1089, 2178]\n```\n(Palindromic numbers are like: 171, 454, 4224, these ones should be discarded)\n\nHappy coding!!\n\n(The sequence of these kind of numbers is registered in OEIS as A110819)\n",
