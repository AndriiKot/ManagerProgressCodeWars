  "description": "Consider the prime number `23`. If we sum the square of its digits we get:\n`2^2 + 3^2 = 13`, then for `13: 1^2 + 3^2 = 10`, and finally for `10: 1^2 + 0^2 = 1`. \n\nSimilarly, if we start with prime number `7`, the sequence is: `7->49->97->130->10->1`.\n\nGiven a range, how many primes within that range will eventually end up being `1`? \n\nThe upperbound for the range is `50,000`. A range of `(2,25)` means that: `2 <= n < 25`. \n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you like this Kata, please try:\n\n[Prime reversion](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59b46276afcda204ed000094)\n\n[Domainant primes](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59ce11ea9f0cbc8a390000ed)",
