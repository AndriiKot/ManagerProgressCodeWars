In each step, one can apply one of the operations\ngiven below:\n\n• Divide by three. This operation can be applied only if the number is divisible by three.\n\n• Divide by two. This operation can be applied only if the number is divisible by two.\n\n• Subtract one\n\n**Code size must be less than 116 characters.**\n\n**Code must be one line.**\n\nTESTS:\n\n- Easy: 1 to 100\n- Normal: 500 to 2000\n- Hard: 2000 to 10000\n- Insane: 10^6 to 10^7\n- Unhuman: 10^50 to 10^51",
