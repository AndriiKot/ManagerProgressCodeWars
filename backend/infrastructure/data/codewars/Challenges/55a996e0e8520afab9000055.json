  "description": "For this problem you must create a program that says who ate the last cookie. If the input is a string then \"Zach\" ate the cookie. If the input is a float or an int then \"Monica\" ate the cookie. If the input is anything else \"the dog\" ate the cookie. The way to return the statement is:\n\"Who ate the last cookie? It was (name)!\"\n\nEx: Input = \"hi\" --> Output = \"Who ate the last cookie? It was Zach!\n(The reason you return Zach is because the input is a string)\n\nNote: Make sure you return the correct message with correct spaces and punctuation.\n\nPlease leave feedback for this kata.\nCheers!",
