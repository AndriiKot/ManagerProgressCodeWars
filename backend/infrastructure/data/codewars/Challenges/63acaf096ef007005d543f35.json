  "description": "Copy rectangular region between two 2-dimensional arrays. Input parameters:\n - `src` source array\n - `srcRow` starting row in source array\n - `srcCol` starting column in source array\n - `dest` destination array\n - `destRow` starting row in destination array\n - `destCol` starting column in destination array\n - `height` number of rows to copy\n - `width` number of columns to copy\n\nInput parameters are guaranteed to be valid - both arrays are completely initialized and copied region is within bounds. Source array must not be changed. Destination array must keep all elements outside the area unchanged. Source array and destination array are always **not the same**. Source and destination do not necessary have same dimensions.\n\n#### Example\nCopying [3x6] from [6x10]@(1; 2) to [3x12]@(0; 1)\n\n```\n  . . . . . . . . . .\n  . . x x x x x x . .      \n  . . x x x x x x . .      . x x x x x x . . . . .\n  . . x x x x x x . .  ->  . x x x x x x . . . . .\n  . . . . . . . . . .      . x x x x x x . . . . .\n  . . . . . . . . . .\n  \n```\n\n#### Constraints\n - dimensions of arrays do not exceed 1000\n - source and destination regions are within bounds\n - 0 <= `width` < 1000 (additionally limited by arrays' dimensions)\n - 0 <= `height` < 1000 (additionally limited by arrays' dimensions)\n - `src` and `dest` are not the same array\n - consider elements as integers between -100 and 100 (doesn't matter for copying purposes)\n",
