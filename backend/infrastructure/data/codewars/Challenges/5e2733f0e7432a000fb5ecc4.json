  "description": "# How many urinals are free?\nIn men's public toilets with urinals, there is this unwritten rule that you leave at least one urinal free\nbetween you and the next person peeing. \nFor example if there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, you will choose the\nurinal on the right and not the one in the middle.\nThat means that a maximum of 3 people can pee at the same time on public toilets with \n5 urinals when following this rule (Only 2 if the first person pees into urinal 2 or 4).\n\n![Imgur Urinals](https://i.imgur.com/imZE6xm.png)\n\n## Your task:\nYou need to write a function that returns the maximum of free urinals as an integer according to the unwritten rule.\n\n### Input\nA String containing 1s and 0s (Example: `10001`) (1 <= Length <= 20)  \nA one stands for a taken urinal and a zero for a free one. \n\n### Examples\n\n`10001` returns 1 (10101)  \n`1001` returns 0 (1001)  \n`00000` returns 3 (10101)  \n`0000` returns 2 (1001)  \n`01000` returns 1 (01010 or 01001) \n\n### Note\nWhen there is already a mistake in the input string (for example `011`), then return `-1`\n\nHave fun and don't pee into the wrong urinal ;)\n",
