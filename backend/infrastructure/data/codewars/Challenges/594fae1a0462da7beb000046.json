  "description": "Jump is a simple one-player game:\n\nYou are initially at the first cell of an array of cells containing non-negative integers;\n\nAt each step you can jump ahead in the array as far as the integer at the current cell, or any smaller number of cells.\nYou win if there is a path that allows you to jump from one cell to another, eventually jumping past the end of the array, otherwise you lose.\n\nFor instance, if the array contains the integers \n\n`[2, 0, 3, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0]`,\n\nyou can win by jumping from **2**, to **3**, to **5**, to **3**, to **3**, then past the end of the array.\n\nYou can also directly jump from from the initial cell(first cell) past the end of the array if they are integers to the right of that cell.\n\nE.g \n\n`[6, 1, 1]` is winnable\n\n`[6]` is **not** winnable\n\nNote: You can **not** jump from the last cell!\n\n`[1, 1, 3]` is **not** winnable\n\n## -----\n\nYour task is to complete the function that determines if a given game is winnable.\n\n### More Examples\n\n```\n[5] => false (you can't jump from the last cell)\n[2, 5] => true\n[3, 0, 2, 3] => true (3 to 2 then past end of array)\n[4, 1, 2, 0, 1] => false\n[5, 0, 0, 0] => true\n[1, 1] => false\n```\n\n",
