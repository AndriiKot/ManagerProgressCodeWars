  "description": "Positive integers that are divisible exactly by the sum of their digits are called [Harshad numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshad_number). \nThe first few Harshad numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, ...\n\nWe are interested in Harshad numbers where the product of its digit sum `s` and `s` with the digits reversed, gives the original number `n`. For example consider number 1729:\n\n* its digit sum, `s` = 1 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 19\n* reversing `s` = 91\n* and 19 \\* 91 = 1729 --> the number that we started with.\n\n\nComplete the function which tests if a positive integer `n` is Harshad number, and returns `True` if the product of its digit sum and its digit sum reversed equals `n`; otherwise return `False`.",
