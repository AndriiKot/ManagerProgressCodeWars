  "description": "**Task:** Find the number couple with the greatest difference from a list of number-couples.\n\n**Input:** A list of number-couples, where each couple is represented as a string containing two positive integers separated by a hyphen (\"-\").\n\n**Output:** The number couple with the greatest difference, or `False` if there is no difference among any of the couples or in case of an empty list.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- All number couples will be given as strings.\n- All numbers in the couples are positive integers.\n- If multiple couples have the same greatest difference, return the first one encountered in the input list.\n- If there is no difference (both numbers in a couple are equal), return `False`.",
