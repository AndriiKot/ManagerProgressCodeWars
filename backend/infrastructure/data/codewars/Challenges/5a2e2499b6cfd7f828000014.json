  "description": "Hello, my name is Anna, and I'm the director of elementary school. Every month I accept applications for schooling from new guys and when I process it manually, I get a little tired. Сould you help me and automate this process?\n\nIf so, you have information about the ages of all these new pupils (```array``` of ages - only positive digital numbers). Your goal is to sort sort these ages by grade. Your function ```schoolSelection``` needs to return an object where ```key``` is grade level and ```value``` is a number of convenient ages. \n\nAdditional information: \n\n```\nLevel           -> age\n\nKindergarten\t -> 5\n1st grade\t    -> 6\n2nd grade\t    -> 7\n3rd grade\t    -> 8\n4th grade\t    -> 9\n\n```\n\n\nExample:\n\n```\nschoolSelection([5, 7, 4, 9, 10, 5, 15, 9, 5])\n\nOutput: \n{\n  'Kindergarten': 3,\n  '1st grade': 0,\n  '2nd grade': 1, \n  '3rd grade': 0, \n  '4th grade': 2,\n}\n\n```\n",
