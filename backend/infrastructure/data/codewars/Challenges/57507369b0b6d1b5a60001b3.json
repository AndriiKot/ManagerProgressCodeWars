  "description": "In genetics a reading frame is a way to divide a sequence of nucleotides (DNA bases) into a set of consecutive non-overlapping triplets (also called codon). Each of this triplets is translated into an amino-acid during a translation process to create proteins.\n\nInput\n---\nIn a single strand of DNA you find 3 Reading frames, take for example the following input sequence:\n\n    AGGTGACACCGCAAGCCTTATATTAGC\n    \nOutput\n---\nFor the output we are going to take the combinations and show them in the following manner:\n\n````\nFrame 1: AGG TGA CAC CGC AAG CCT TAT ATT AGC\nFrame 2: A GGT GAC ACC GCA AGC CTT ATA TTA GC\nFrame 3: AG GTG ACA CCG CAA GCC TTA TAT TAG C\n````\n\nFor frame 1 split all of them in groups of three starting by the first base (letter).\n\nFor frame 2 split all of them in groups of three starting by the second base (letter) but having the first base (letter) at the beggining.\n\nFor frame 3 split all of them in groups of three starting by the third letter, but having the first and second bases (letters) at the beginning in the same order.\n\nSeries\n---\n\n1.
