  "description": "Compute the [complex logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_logarithm) at any given **complex number**, accurate to at least `1 in 10^-12`. The imaginary part should be inside the interval `(−π, π]` (i.e if the imaginary part is exactly `π`, keep it as is).\n\nNote: You shouldn't try to compute the value of this function at the poles. Please return `null`/`NULL`/`nil`/`None` (C#: throw an `ArgumentException`, Java: throw an `ArithmeticException`) if this happens.\n\n~~~if:csharp\n`System.Numerics` is disallowed in this Kata.\n~~~",
