  "description": "**Background**\n\nA geometric progression / series is the sum of a geometric sequence. \n\nA geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers that scale by a common ratio, usually denoted as `r`. To get the next term, multiply the current term by this value. *The first term is provided for this kata.*\n\nFor example, the first 4 terms of the geometric sequence with first term `2` and ratio `3` is `2, 6, 18, 54`. Notice that, given any term, it is `3` times larger than the last term for this case.\n\nA geometric series is just the first `n` terms of the sequence summed together. For instance, the sum of the first four terms of the example provided above is `$2 + 6 + 18 + 54 = 80$`.\n\n**Kata Task**\n\nComplete the function which will help you compute a geometric progression / series.\n\nThe parameters provided are as follows:\n- `a` is the first term\n- `r` is the common ratio\n- `n` is the amount of terms\n\nExample:\n\n`a = 2, r = 3, n = 5` should return 242.\n\nInput constraints:\n\n- `a`: 1 - 10\n- `r`: -10 - 10\n- `n`: 2 - 15\n\nTests:\n\n- 5 fixed tests\n- 50 random tests\n\nFor tests with decimal values your solution must have precision of `1e-9`.\n\nMore info:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_progression",
