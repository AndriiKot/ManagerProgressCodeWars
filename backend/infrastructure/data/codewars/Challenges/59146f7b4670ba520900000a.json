  "description": "### Story\n\nYou are a h4ck3r n00b: you \"acquired\" a bunch of password hashes, and you want to decypher them. Based on the length, you already guessed that they must be SHA-1 hashes. You also know that these are weak passwords: maximum 5 characters long and use only lowercase letters (`a-z`), no other characters.\n\nHappy hacking!\n\n**Notes:**\n* pre-generating the full hash table is not advised, due to the time-limit on the CW platform\n* there will be only a few tests for 5-letter words *(hint: start from the beginning of the alphabet)*\n* if your solution times out, try running it again - the CW runner is sometimes a bit slow(er)\n\n---\n\n### My other katas\n\nIf you enjoyed this kata then please try [my other katas](https://www.codewars.com/users/anter69/authored)! :-)\n\n#### *Translations are welcome!*",
