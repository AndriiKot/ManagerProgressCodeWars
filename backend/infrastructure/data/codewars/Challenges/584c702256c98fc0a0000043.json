  "description": "*I know that there are quite a few fizz-buzz problems already out there but this one does have a twist [(you may find this useful)](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp)*\n\n## Task\nYou need to implement a function that applies the standard fizz buzz test:\n\n- If a number is divisible by 3, return `Fizz`\n- If it is divisible by 5, return `Buzz`\n- If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, return `FizzBuzz`\n- If it is not divisible by 3 or 5, return the number itself\n\nHowever, when making the function, **you cannot** use `if` (meaning `else` is also not an option).\n\n## Input\n- A number will always be provided\n- The number provided will always be positive and an integer\n\n## Examples\n- `6` should return `Fizz`\n- `10` should return `Buzz`\n- `15` should return `FizzBuzz`\n- `17` should return `17`",
