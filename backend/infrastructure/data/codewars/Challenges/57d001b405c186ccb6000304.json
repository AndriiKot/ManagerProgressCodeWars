It hurts... trust me.\n\nYour task is to take a distance that an athlete is through the race, and return one of the following:\n\nIf the distance is zero, return `'Starting Line... Good Luck!'`.\n\nIf the athlete will be swimming, return an object with `'Swim'` as the key, and the remaining race distance as the value.\n\nIf the athlete will be riding their bike, return an object with `'Bike'` as the key, and the remaining race distance as the value.\n\nIf the athlete will be running, and has more than 10 miles to go, return an object with `'Run'` as the key, and the remaining race distance as the value.\n\nIf the athlete has 10 miles or less to go, return return an object with `'Run'` as the key, and `'Nearly there!'` as the value.\n\nFinally, if the athlete has completed te distance, return `\"You're done! Stop running!\"`.\n\nAll distance should be calculated to two decimal places.\n",
