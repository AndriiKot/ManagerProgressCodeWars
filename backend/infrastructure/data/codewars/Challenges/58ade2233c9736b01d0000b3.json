  "description": "You need to write a password generator that meets the following criteria:\n\n* 6 - 20 characters long\n* contains at least one lowercase letter\n* contains at least one uppercase letter\n* contains at least one number\n* contains only alphanumeric characters (no special characters)\n\nReturn the random password as a string.\n\n**Note**: \"randomness\" is checked by counting the characters used in the generated passwords - all characters should have less than 50% occurance. Based on extensive tests, the normal rate is around 35%.\n\n",
