  "description": "The function sigma 1, σ1 in mathematics, is known as the one that gives the sum of the divisors of an integer number.\n\nFor example for the number 10,\n```\nσ1(10) = 18 - because the divisors of 10 are: 1, 2, 5, 10\n\nσ1(10) = 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 18\n```\nYou can see the graph of this important function up to 250:\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/PPn4EGC\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/PPn4EGC.jpg?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nThe number 528 and its reversed, 825 have equal value for the function σ1.\n```\nσ1(528) = σ1(825)\n\ndivisors of 528 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, 16, 22, 24, 33, 44, 48, 66, 88, 132, 176, 264 and 528\n\nthe sum of the divisors of 528 is 1488\n\ndivisors of 825 are: 1, 3, 5, 11, 15, 25, 33, 55, 75, 165, 275 and 825\n\nthe sum of the divisors of 825 is 1488\n```\nIn fact 528 is the smallest non palindromic integer that has this property.\n\nWe need a function that may collect all the positive integers that fulfill the property described above.\n\n\nThis function receives an upper limit as argument and outputs the total sum of these numbers and its reversed that are less or equal to this upper limit.\n\nLet's see some cases:\n```\nupper limit: 100 --> 0 - There are no numbers.\n\nupper limit: 1000 --> 1353 - 528 and its reversed 825 were found, 528 +  825 = 1353\n\nupper limit: 2000 --> 4565 - There are four numbers: 528 + 825 + 1561 + 1651 = 4565\n\nupper limit: 1600 --> 2914 - Now we have three numbers: 528 + 825 + 1561 = 2914\n\nupper limit: 1561 --> 2914\n```\n\n### Note\n- The upper limit will be tested up to 10000.\n- The palindromic numbers (like 88, 808, 929), numbers that are equal to its reversed should be discarded.\n\nHappy coding!!\n\n(For more information about the general sigma function see at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_function)\n",
