  "description": "## Task\n Pac-Man got lucky today! Due to minor performance issue all his enemies have frozen. Too bad Pac-Man is not brave enough to face them right now, so he doesn't want any enemy to see him. \n \n Given a gamefield of size `N` x `N`, Pac-Man's position(`PM`) and his enemies' positions(`enemies`), your task is to count the number of coins he can collect without being seen.\n\n An enemy can see a Pac-Man if they are standing on the same row or column. \n \n It is guaranteed that no enemy can see Pac-Man on the starting position. There is a coin on each empty square (i.e. where there is no Pac-Man or enemy).\n\n## Example\n\n For `N = 4, PM = [3, 0], enemies = [[1, 2]]`, the result should be `3`.\n```\nLet O represent coins, P - Pac-Man and E - enemy.\nOOOO\nOOEO\nOOOO\nPOOO\n```\nPac-Man cannot cross row 1 and column 2. \n\n He can only collect coins from points `(2, 0), (2, 1) and (3, 1)`, like this:\n ```\nx is the points that Pac-Man can collect the coins.\nOOOO\nOOEO\nxxOO\nPxOO\n ```\n\n## Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `N`\n\n  The field size.\n\n\n - `[input]` integer array `PM`\n\n  Pac-Man's position (pair of integers)\n\n\n - `[input]` 2D integer array `enemies`\n\n  Enemies' positions (array of pairs)\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\n  Number of coins Pac-Man can collect.\n  \n  \n# More PacMan Katas\n\n - [Play PacMan: Devour all](https://www.codewars.com/kata/575c29d5fcee86cb8b000136)\n\n - [Play PacMan 2: The way home](https://www.codewars.com/kata/575ed46e23891f67d90000d8)",
