  "description": "### Problem Description\n\nYou're a fisherman by the peaceful riverside, and you've set up a bunch of fishing rods along the riverbank. Each rod has a unique name, and each rod catches a certain number of fish over a period of time. Your task is to write a function that calculates the total number of fish caught by all the rods combined.\n\n### Input\n\nYou will be given a list of fishing rods, where each rod is represented by a tuple of its name (a `String`) and the number of fish it has caught (an `i32`).\n\n```rust\nlet rods = vec![\n    (\"Rod1\".to_string(), 5),\n    (\"Rod2\".to_string(), 7),\n    (\"Rod3\".to_string(), 3),\n];\n```\n\n### Output\n```rust\n15\n```\n",
