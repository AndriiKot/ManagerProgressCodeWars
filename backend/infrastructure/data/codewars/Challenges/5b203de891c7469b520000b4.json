  "description": "You are the Dungeon Master for a public DnD game at your local comic shop and recently you've had some trouble keeping your players' info neat and organized so you've decided to write a bit of code to help keep them sorted!\n\nThe goal of this code is to create an array of objects that stores a player's name and contact number from a given string.\n\nThe method should return an empty array if the argument passed is an empty string or `nil`/`None`/`null`.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```ruby \nplayer_manager(\"John Doe, 8167238327, Jane Doe, 8163723827\") returns [{player: \"John Doe\", contact: 8167238327}, {player: \"Jane Doe\", contact: 8163723827}]\nplayer_manager(nil) returns []\nplayer_manager(\"\") returns []\n```\n```python\nplayer_manager(\"John Doe, 8167238327, Jane Doe, 8163723827\") returns [{\"player\": \"John Doe\", \"contact\": 8167238327}, {\"player\": \"Jane Doe\", \"contact\": 8163723827}]\nplayer_manager(None) returns []\nplayer_manager(\"\")   returns []\n```\n```\nplayerManager(\"John Doe, 8167238327, Jane Doe, 8163723827\") returns [{player: \"John Doe\", contact: 8167238327}, {player: \"Jane Doe\", contact: 8163723827}]\nplayerManager(null) returns []\nplayerManager(\"\")   returns []\n```\n\nHave at thee!",
