  "description": "# Story\n\nDue to lack of maintenance the minute-hand has fallen off Town Hall clock face.\n\nAnd because the local council has lost most of our tax money to an elaborate email scam there are no funds to fix the clock properly. \n\nInstead, they are asking for volunteer programmers to write some code that tell the time by only looking at the remaining hour-hand!\n\nWhat a bunch of cheapskates!\n\nCan you do it?\n\n# Kata\n\nGiven the ```angle``` (in degrees) of the hour-hand, return the time in 12 hour HH:MM format. Round _down_ to the nearest minute.\n\n# Examples\n\n* ```12:00``` = 0 degrees\n\n\n* ```03:00``` = 90 degrees\n\n\n* ```06:00``` = 180 degrees\n\n\n* ```09:00``` = 270 degrees\n\n\n* ```12:00``` = 360 degrees\n\n# Notes\n\n* 0 <= ```angle``` <= 360\n  \n* Do not make any AM or PM assumptions for the HH:MM result. They are indistinguishable for this Kata.\n\n  * 3 o'clock is ```03:00```, not ```15:00```\n  * 7 minutes past midnight is ```12:07```\n  * 7 minutes past noon is also ```12:07```\n\n",
