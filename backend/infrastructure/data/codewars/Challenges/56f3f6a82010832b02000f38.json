  "description": "# Be Concise I - The Ternary Operator\n\nYou are given a function that takes a parameter ```age``` (which will always be a **positive integer**) and does the following:\n\n1. If the age is ```12``` or lower, it ```return \"You're a(n) kid\"```\n2. If the age is anything between ```13``` and ```17``` (inclusive), it ```return \"You're a(n) teenager\"```\n3. If the age is anything between ```18``` and ```64``` (inclusive), it ```return \"You're a(n) adult\"```\n4. If the age is ```65``` or above, it ```return \"You're a(n) elderly\"```\n\n~~~if-not:python\nYour task is to shorten the code as much as possible. Note that submitting the given code will not work because there is a character limit of **137**.\n~~~\n~~~if:python\nYour task is to shorten the code as much as possible. Note that submitting the given code will not work because there is a character limit of **145**.\n~~~\n\nI'll give you a few hints:\n\n1. The title itself is a hint - if you're not sure what to do, **always** research any terminology in this description that you have not heard of!\n2. Don't you think the whole ```\"You're a(n) <insert_something_here>\"``` is very repetitive? ;)  Perhaps we can shorten it?\n3. Write everything in one line, `\\n` and other whitespaces counts.\n\n**Whatever you do, do not change what the function does.**  Good luck :)",
