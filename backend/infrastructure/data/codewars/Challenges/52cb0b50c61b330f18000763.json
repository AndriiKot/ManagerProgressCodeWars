  "description": "## Background\nReceiving an unknown number of records through AJAX, you want to order these according to your own criteria. The AJAX request does support sorting, so you have to build it by hand.\n\nTo make matters worse, the records may have the same field values and when this happens you want to order them by a secondary field - and continue to third, fourth and so on.\n\n## Task\n\nAn order specification could look like this: \n```javascript\nvar order = [\n  {key: \"job\", direction: \"ascending\"},\n  {key: \"age\", direction: \"descending\"}\n];\n```\n\nThat is, an ordering key (field name) and the direction of the ordering.\n\nFor the records:\n```javascript\nvar records = [\n  {name:\"christian\", age:40, job:\"developer\"},\n  {name:\"andrew\", age:48, job:\"developer\"},\n  {name:\"elisabeth\", age:31, job:\"floor manager\"},\n  {name:\"oscar\", age:61, job:\"floor manager\"},\n  {name:\"gisela\", age:51, job:\"area manager\"},\n  {name:\"buffy\", age:27, job:\"trainee\"},\n  {name:\"carl\", age:23, job:\"trainee\"}\n];\n```\n\nThe output of calling \"multilevelsort(records,order)\" should be:\n```javascript\n[ \n  {name:\"andrew\", age:48, job:\"developer\"},\n  {name:\"buffy\", age:27, job:\"trainee\"},\n  {name:\"carl\", age:23, job:\"trainee\"},\n  {name:\"christian\", age:40, job:\"developer\"},\n  {name:\"elisabeth\", age:31, job:\"floor manager\"},\n  {name:\"gisela\", age:51, job:\"area manager\"},\n  {name:\"oscar\", age:61, job:\"floor manager\"}\n]\n```\n\n## Test Submission\nFor the test fixture, a random record set and a random order set is generated. The number of entries (key-value pairs) in the \"order\" object will vary from test to test as will the number of records.",
