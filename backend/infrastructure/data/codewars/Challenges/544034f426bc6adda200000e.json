  "description": "There are 8 balls numbered from 0 to 7. \nSeven of them have the same weight. One is heavier. Your task is to find its number.\n\nYour function `findBall` will receive single argument - `scales` object. The `scales` object contains an internally stored array of 8 elements (indexes 0-7), each having the same value except one, which is greater. It also has a public method named `getWeight(left, right)` which takes two arrays of indexes and returns -1, 0, or 1 based on the accumulation of the values found at the indexes passed are heavier, equal, or lighter.\n\n`getWeight` returns:\n\n`-1` if **left** pan is heavier\n\n`1` if **right** pan is heavier\n\n`0` if both pans weigh the same\n\nExamples of `scales.getWeight()` usage:\n\n`scales.getWeight([3], [7])` returns `-1` if ball 3 is heavier than ball 7, `1` if ball 7 is heavier, or `0` i these balls have the same weight.\n\n`scales.getWeight([3, 4], [5, 2])` returns `-1` if weight of balls 3 and 4 is heavier than weight of balls 5 and 2 etc.\n\nSo where's the catch, you may ask. Well - the scales is very old. You can use it only **TWICE** before the scale breaks.\n\n``` if:python,ruby,crystal\n**Note** - Use `scales.get_weight()` in the Python, Crystal and Ruby versions.\n```\n``` if:ocaml\n**Note** - Use `scales#get_weight` in the OCaml version.\n```\n```if:c\nIn C `findBall()` takes no argument, and `getWeight()` is accessible directly as a function instead of a method.\n```\n\nToo hard ? Try lower levels:\n\n* [novice](http://www.codewars.com/kata/544047f0cf362503e000036e)\n* [conqueror](http://www.codewars.com/kata/54404a06cf36258b08000364)\n\nStill too easy ?
