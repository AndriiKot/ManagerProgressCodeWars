  "description": "You know combinations: for example, \nif you take `5` cards from a `52` cards deck you have `2,598,960` different combinations.\n\nIn mathematics the number of `x` combinations you can take from a set of `n` elements\nis called the *binomial coefficient of n and x*, or more often `n choose x`.\nThe formula to compute `n choose x` is:\n\n`n! / (x! * (n - x)!)`\n\nwhere `!` is the factorial operator.\n\nYou are a renowned poster designer and painter. You are asked to provide `6` posters \nall having the same design each in `2` colors. Posters must all have a different color combination and you have the choice of `4` colors: `red, blue, yellow, green`. \nHow many colors can you choose for each poster?\n\nThe answer is **two** since `4 choose 2 = 6`. The combinations will be:\n`{red, blue}, {red, yellow}, {red, green}, {blue, yellow}, {blue, green}, {yellow, green}`.\n\nNow same question but you have `35` posters to provide and `7` colors available. How many colors for each poster?\nIf you take combinations `7 choose 2` you will get `21` with the above formula.\nBut `21` schemes aren't enough for `35` posters. If you take `7 choose 5` combinations you will get `21` too.\nFortunately if you take `7 choose 3` or `7 choose 4` combinations you get `35` and so each poster will have a different combination of\n`3` colors or `4` colors. You will take `3` colors because it's less expensive.\n\n#### Hence the problem: \n\nKnowing `m` (number of posters to design) and `n` (total number of available colors), \nlet us search `x`, the number of colors for each poster so that each poster has a unique combination of colors and the number of combinations is exactly the same as the number of posters `m`.\n\nIn other words, you must find `x` such that:\n\n`n choose x = m` \n\nfor a given `m >= 0` and a given `n > 0`.\nIf there are several solutions, return the smallest. If there are no solutions, return `-1`.\n\n#### Examples:\n```\n(m =  6, n = 4) -->  2\n(m =  4, n = 4) -->  1\n(m =  4, n = 2) --> -1\n(m = 35, n = 7) -->  3\n(m = 36, n = 7) --> -1\n\na = 47129212243960\n(m = a,     n = 50) --> 20\n(m = a + 1, n = 50) --> -1\n```\n",
