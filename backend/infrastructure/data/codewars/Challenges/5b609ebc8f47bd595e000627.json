  "description": "Your job is to find the gravitational force between two spherical objects (obj1 , obj2).\n\ninput\n====\n\nTwo arrays are given : \n\n- arr_val (value array), consists of 3 elements\n    - 1st element : mass of obj 1\n    - 2nd element : mass of obj 2\n    - 3rd element : distance between their centers\n- arr_unit (unit array), consists of 3 elements\n    - 1st element : unit for mass of obj 1\n    - 2nd element : unit for mass of obj 2\n    - 3rd element : unit for distance between their centers\n\nmass units are : \n    \n- kilogram (kg)\n- gram (g)\n- milligram (mg)\n- microgram (μg)\n- pound (lb)\n\ndistance units are : \n\n- meter (m)\n- centimeter (cm)\n- millimeter (mm)\n- micrometer (μm)\n- feet (ft)\n\nNote\n====\n\n\nvalue of G = 6.67 × 10<sup>−11</sup> N⋅kg<sup>−2</sup>⋅m<sup>2<sup> \n\n1 ft = 0.3048 m\n\n1 lb = 0.453592 kg\n\nreturn value must be Newton for force (obviously)\n\n`μ` copy this from here to use it in your solution \n",
