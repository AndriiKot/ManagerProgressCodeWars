  "description": "# Task\n Consider the following ciphering algorithm:\n```\nFor each character replace it with its code.\nConcatenate all of the obtained numbers.\n```\nGiven a ciphered string, return the initial one if it is known that it consists only of lowercase letters.\n\n Note: here the character's code means its `decimal ASCII code`, the numerical representation of a character used by most modern programming languages.\n\n# Example\n\n For `cipher = \"10197115121\"`, the output should be `\"easy\"`.\n\n Explanation: \n ```\n charCode('e') = 101, \n charCode('a') = 97, \n charCode('s') = 115 \n charCode('y') = 121.\n```\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` string `cipher`\n\n   A non-empty string which is guaranteed to be a cipher for some other string of lowercase letters.\n\n\n - `[output]` a string",
