  "description": "# Task\n\nWrite a function that accepts `msg` string and returns local tops of string from the highest to the lowest.  \nThe string's tops are from displaying the string in the below way:\n\n```\n                                                      3\n                              p                     2   4\n            g               o   q                 1\n  b       f   h           n       r             z\na   c   e       i       m          s          y\n      d           j   l             t       x\n                    k                 u   w\n                                        v\n```\nThe next top is always 1 character higher than the previous one. \nFor the above example, the solution for the `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234` input string is `3pgb`.\n\n- When the `msg` string is empty, return an empty string.\n- The input strings may be very long. Make sure your solution has good performance.\n\nCheck the test cases for more samples.\n\n~~~if:cpp\n## Note\n\nDo not post an issue in my solution without checking if your returned string doesn't have some invisible characters. You read most probably outside of `msg` string.\n~~~",
