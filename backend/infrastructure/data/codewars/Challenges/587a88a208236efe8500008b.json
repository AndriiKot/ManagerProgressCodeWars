  "description": "As the title suggests, this is the hard-core version of <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-a-sequence/\" target=\"_blank\"> another neat kata</a>.\n\nThe task is simple to explain: simply sum all the numbers from the first parameter being the beginning to the second parameter being the upper limit (possibly included), going in steps expressed by the third parameter:\n\n```javascript\nsequenceSum(2,2,2) === 2\nsequenceSum(2,6,2) === 12 // 2 + 4 + 6\nsequenceSum(1,5,1) === 15 // 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5\nsequenceSum(1,5,3) === 5 // 1 + 4\n```\n```python\nsequence_sum(2, 2, 2) # 2\nsequence_sum(2, 6, 2) # 12 (= 2 + 4 + 6)\nsequence_sum(1, 5, 1) # (= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)\nsequence_sum(1, 5, 3) # 5 (= 1 + 4)\n```\n```ruby\nsequence_sum(2, 2, 2) # 2\nsequence_sum(2, 6, 2) # 12 (= 2 + 4 + 6)\nsequence_sum(1, 5, 1) # (= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)\nsequence_sum(1, 5, 3) # 5 (= 1 + 4)\n```\n```crystal\nsequence_sum(2, 2, 2) # 2\nsequence_sum(2, 6, 2) # 12 (= 2 + 4 + 6)\nsequence_sum(1, 5, 1) # (= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)\nsequence_sum(1, 5, 3) # 5 (= 1 + 4)\n```\n```csharp\nSequenceSum(2, 2, 2) # 2\nSequenceSum(2, 6, 2) # 12 (= 2 + 4 + 6)\nSequenceSum(1, 5, 1) # (= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)\nSequenceSum(1, 3, 5) # 1\n```\n\nIf it is an impossible sequence (with the beginning being larger the end and a positive step or the other way around), just return `0`. See the provided test cases for further examples :)\n\n**Note:** differing from the other base kata, much larger ranges are going to be tested, so you should hope to get your algo optimized and to avoid brute-forcing your way through the solution.",
