  "description": "You have a natural number ```m```. \n\nYou need to write a function ```f(m)``` which finds the smallest positive number ```n``` such that\n`$\nn^n\\equiv 0 \\mod m\n$`.\n\nIn other words `$n^n$` is divisible by ```m```.\n\nFor example:\n```\nf(13) = 13\nf(420) = 210\nf(666) = 222\nf(1234567890) = 411522630\n```\n\nIn this kata all the tests will be with \n`$\n1 \\leqslant m \\leqslant 10^{24}\n$`\n\nKeep in mind that ```n <= m```, so iterating over ```n``` and cheking ```pow(n,n,m) == 0``` in total for `$O(nlog(n))$` operations is not an option.\n",
