Each person is given a hat. None of them can see their own hat, but person `a` can see the hats of `b` and `c`, while person `b` can see the hat of person `c`. Neither `c` nor `d` can see any hats.\n\nOnce a person figures out the color of their hat, they shout it.\n \n![Four men, in decreasing height, standing behind each other, wearing black and white colored hats, with the last man on the right hidden behind the wall.](https://i.imgur.com/m6wvteb.jpg)\n \nYour task is to return the person who will guess their hat first.
