  "description": "## Description:\n\nIn this kata, your task is to reduce values in the input array which are poker card symbols or their codes.  \nReduction is about getting card symbols or card codes without the offset which is added by card color (symbols: `['c','d','h','s']` -> club, diamond, heart, spade).  \n\nThis kind of transformation (getting the root value of a card) is very helpful for evaluating a poker hand, which is the subject of a future kata 'Calculating poker hand'.  \n\nBase (reduced) card codes and symbols are (index: code, value: human-readable symbol): `['A','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','T','J','Q','K']`\n\n## Requirements:\n\nYou can get four types of input:\n\n1. Non-array argument - you must return null\n2. Empty array - you must return an empty array\n3. Array of symbols (strings) - you must return reduced symbols sorted by symbol code in ascending order: `reduceCards(['Td','Qd', '8c','Ac', 'Ks','Qs'])` returns `[\"A\", \"8\", \"T\", \"Q\", \"Q\", \"K\"]`\n4. Array of codes (integers) - you must return reduced codes sorted by their value in ascending order: `reduceCards()` returns ``\n\n## Additional info:\n\nYou may find it useful to solve my previous kata about encoding/decoding poker hands: Poker cards encoder/decoder  \nTo illustrate how card codes are propagated over colors, this table is very helpful:\n\n```\n  c    |     d     |    h     |    s\n---------------------------------------\n 0: A\t  13: A\t  26: A\t  39: A\n 1: 2  \t14: 2\t  27: 2\t  40: 2\n 2: 3\t  15: 3\t  28: 3\t  41: 3\n 3: 4\t  16: 4\t  29: 4\t  42: 4\n 4: 5\t  17: 5\t  30: 5\t  43: 5\n 5: 6\t  18: 6\t  31: 6\t  44: 6\n 6: 7\t  19: 7\t  32: 7\t  45: 7\n 7: 8\t  20: 8\t  33: 8\t  46: 8\n 8: 9\t  21: 9\t  34: 9\t  47: 9\n 9: T\t  22: T\t  35: T\t  48: T\n10: J\t  23: J\t  36: J\t  49: J\n11: Q\t  24: Q\t  37: Q\t  50: Q\n12: K\t  25: K\t  38: K\t  51: K\n```\n",
