  "description": "You will be making a program that shows all positions a chess piece can go to.\nThe function has 2 parameters: the position on the chess board in the format a1 and a letter representing the piece. This will be K, Q, R, B, N for respectively the King, Queen, Rook, Bishop and Knight\n\nThis is what the matrix looks like for a queen in d3:\n```python\n[[0,  0,  0,  1,  0,  0,  0,  0],\n [0,  0,  0,  1,  0,  0,  0,  1],\n [1,  0,  0,  1,  0,  0,  1,  0],\n [0,  1,  0,  1,  0,  1,  0,  0],\n [0,  0,  1,  1,  1,  0,  0,  0],\n [1,  1,  1, -1,  1,  1,  1,  1],\n [0,  0,  1,  1,  1,  0,  0,  0],\n [0,  1,  0,  1,  0,  1,  0,  0]]\n ```\n \n Take a look at the test cases for some more examples.\n \n See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess#Movement for the movement rules of the pieces.\n \n Good luck :P",
