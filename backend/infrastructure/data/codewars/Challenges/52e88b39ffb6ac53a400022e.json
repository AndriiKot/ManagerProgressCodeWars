  "description": "Take the following IPv4 address: `128.32.10.1`\n\nThis address has 4 octets where each octet is a single byte (or 8 bits).\n\n* 1st octet `128` has the binary representation: `10000000`\n* 2nd octet `32` has the binary representation: `00100000`\n* 3rd octet `10` has the binary representation: `00001010`\n* 4th octet `1` has the binary representation: `00000001`\n\nSo `128.32.10.1` == `10000000.00100000.00001010.00000001`\n\nBecause the above IP address has 32 bits, we can represent it as the unsigned 32 bit number: `2149583361`\n\nComplete the function that takes an unsigned 32 bit number and returns a string representation of its IPv4 address.\n\n## Examples\n```\n2149583361 ==> \"128.32.10.1\"\n32         ==> \"0.0.0.32\"\n0          ==> \"0.0.0.0\"\n```\n",
