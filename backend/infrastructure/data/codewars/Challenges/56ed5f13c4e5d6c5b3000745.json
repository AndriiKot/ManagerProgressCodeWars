  "description": "You and your best friend Stripes have just landed your first high school jobs! You'll be delivering newspapers to your neighbourhood on weekends. For your services you'll be charging a set price depending on the quantity of the newspaper bundles.\n\nThe cost of deliveries is:\n\n- $3.85 for 40 newspapers\n- $1.93 for 20\n- $0.97 for 10 \n- $0.49 for 5 \n- $0.10 for 1 \n\nStripes is taking care of the footwork doing door-to-door drops and your job is to take care of the finances. What you'll be doing is providing the cheapest possible quotes for your services.\n\nWrite a function that's passed an integer representing the amount of newspapers and returns the cheapest price. The returned number must be rounded to two decimal places.\n\n![Paperboy](http://mametesters.org/file_download.php?file_id=1016&type=bug)",
