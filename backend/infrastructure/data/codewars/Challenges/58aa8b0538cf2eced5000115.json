  "description": "# Task\n Sorting is one of the most basic computational devices used in Computer Science. \n \n Given a sequence (length ≤ 1000) of 3 different key values (7, 8, 9), your task is to find the minimum number of exchange operations necessary to make the sequence sorted. \n\n One operation is the switching of 2 key values in the sequence.\n\n# Example\n\n For `sequence = [7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]`, the result should be `0`.\n \n It's already a sorted sequence.\n\n For `sequence = [9, 7, 8, 8, 9, 7]`, the result should be `1`.\n \n We can switching `sequence[0]` and `sequence[5]`.\n \n For `sequence = [8, 8, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 7]`, the result should be `4`.\n \n We can:\n```\n [8, 8, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 7] \n switching sequence[0] and sequence[3]\n --> [9, 8, 7, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 7]\n switching sequence[0] and sequence[8]\n --> [7, 8, 7, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9]\n switching sequence[1] and sequence[2]\n --> [7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9]\n switching sequence[5] and sequence[7]\n --> [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9] \n```\nSo `4` is the minimum number of operations for the sequence to become sorted.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer array `sequence`\n\n  The Sequence.\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\n  the minimum number of operations.",
