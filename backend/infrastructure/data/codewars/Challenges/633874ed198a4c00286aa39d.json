  "description": "Twelve cards with grades from `0` to `11` randomly divided among `3` players: Frank, Sam, and Tom, `4` cards each. The game consists of `4` rounds.\nThe goal of the round is to move by the card with the most points.<br>\nIn round `1`, the first player who has a card with `0` points, takes the first turn, and he starts with that card.\nThen the second player (queue - Frank -> Sam -> Tom -> Frank, etc.) can move with any of his cards (each card is used only once per game, and there are no rules that require players to make only the best moves).\nThe third player makes his move after the second player, and he sees the previous moves.<br>\nThe winner of the previous round then makes the first move in the next round with any remaining card.<br>\nThe player who wins `2` rounds first, wins the game.\n\n## Task\n\nReturn `true` if Frank has a chance of winning the game.<br>\nReturn `false` if Frank has no chance.\n\n## Input\n\n`3` arrays of `4` unique numbers in each (numbers in array are sorted in ascending order).\nInput is always valid, no need to check.\n\n## Example\n\nRound `1`: Frank ` 2 5 8 11 `, Sam ` 1 4 7 10 `, Tom ` 0 3 6 9 `.\nTom has to start from `0`. Frank is risking nothing and goes `2`.\nSam gets lucky and wins round by throwing `4`.\n\nRound `2`: Frank ` 5 8 11 `, Sam ` 1 7 10 `, Tom ` 3 6 9 `.\nSam starts from `1`. Tom goes `3`, Frank wins with `5`.\n\nRound `3`: Frank ` 8 11 `, Sam ` 7 10 `, Tom ` 6 9 `.\nFrank starts from `11` and wins the round either way.\n\nFrank is the first to win `2` rounds and therefore wins the game, the answer is `true`.\n\n## One more example\nFrank ` 0 1 2 3 `, Sam ` 6 7 8 11 `, Tom ` 4 5 9 10 `.<br>\nWith these cards Frank has no chance, the answer is `false`.\n\n## Tip\nPlayers can actually play DUMB moves, especially Sam and Tom.",
