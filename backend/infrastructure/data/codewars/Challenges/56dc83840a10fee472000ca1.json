  "description": "You will be given a function, `isFibo`, which will take three arguments: `a`, `b` and `f`.\n\n`a` is the first term of a Fibonacci sequence, `b` is the second term of this sequence ( it will always be bigger than or equal to `a` and they'll be both always positive, so don't worry about pesky input checking ) and `f` is a number which you'll need to check whether or not is a part of this Fibonacci sequence.\n\nGood luck, muh fellow coding warrior.",
