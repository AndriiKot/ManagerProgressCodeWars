Find such two numbers m,n: m and n at least a difference of `k`, and their index is the most distant.\n \n Returns their distance of index. If no such number found, return `-1`.\n \n# Some Examples\n\n```javascript\nfurthestDistance([8,7,1,9],5) === 2\n\nThe difference of 8 and 1, 1 and 9 is more than 5;\nThe index distance of (8,1) is 2;\nThe index distance of (1,9) is 1;\nSo 2 is the furthest distance of index.\n\nfurthestDistance([8,7,1,9],100) === -1\nfurthestDistance([1,2,3,4],1) === 3 (1 and 4)\nfurthestDistance([3,4,1,2],2) === 2 (3 and 1 or 4 and 2)\n```\n```ruby\nfurthest_distance([8,7,1,9],5) === 2\n\nThe difference of 8 and 1, 1 and 9 is more than 5;\nThe index distance of (8,1) is 2;\nThe index distance of (1,9) is 1;\nSo 2 is the furthest distance of index.\n\nfurthest_distance([8,7,1,9],100) === -1\nfurthest_distance([1,2,3,4],1) === 3 (1 and 4)\nfurthest_distance([3,4,1,2],2) === 2 (3 and 1 or 4 and 2)\n```\n",
