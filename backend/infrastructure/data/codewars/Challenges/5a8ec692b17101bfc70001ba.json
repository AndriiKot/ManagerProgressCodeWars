  "description": "You are the owner of the Grocery Store. All your products are in the database, that you have created after CodeWars SQL excercises!:)\n\nYou have reached a conclusion that you waste to much time because you have too many different warehouses to visit each week. \n\nYou have to find out how many different types of product you buy from each producer. If you take only few items from some of them you will stop going there again and save the gasoline:)\n\nIn the results show `producer` and `count_products_types` which you buy from him. \n\nOrder the result by `count_products_types` (DESC) then by `producer` (ASC) in case there are duplicated amounts, \n\n### products table schema\n- id\n- name\n- price\n- stock\n- producer\n\n### results table schema\n- count_products_types\n- producer\n\n\n---\n\n_Note: there has been a critical change in the description and the column names long after the approval/publication of the kata so don't be surprised if you see solutions with different column names once you solved the kata (solutions weren't revalidated after the change because their was already too much of them)._",
