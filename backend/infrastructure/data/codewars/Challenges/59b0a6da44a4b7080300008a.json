  "description": "Converting a 12-hour time like \"8:30 am\" or \"8:30 pm\" to 24-hour time (like \"0830\" or \"2030\") sounds easy enough, right?  Well, let's see if you can do it!\n\nYou will have to define a function, which will be given an hour (always in the range of 1 to 12, inclusive), a minute (always in the range of 0 to 59, inclusive), and a period (either **a.m.** or **p.m.**) as input.\n\nYour task is to return a four-digit string that encodes that time in 24-hour time.\n\n### Notes\n\n- By convention, noon is `12:00 pm`, and midnight is `12:00 am`.  \n- On 12-hours clock, there is no 0 hour, and time just after midnight is denoted as, for example, `12:15 am`. On 24-hour clock, this translates to `0015`.\n",
