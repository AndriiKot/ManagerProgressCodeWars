  "description": "According to [Gary Chapman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Chapman_(author)), marriage counselor and the author of [\"The Five Love Languages\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Love_Languages) books, there are five major ways to express our love towards someone: *words of affirmation, quality time, gifts, acts of service,* and *physical touch*. These are called the love languages. Usually, everyone has a main language: the one that he/she \"speaks\" and understands best. In a relationship, it's important to find your partner's main love language, so that you get along better with each other.\n\n### Your task\n\nUnfortunately, your relationship got worse lately... After a long discussion with your partner, you agreed to give yourself a few weeks to improve it, otherwise you split up...\n\nYou will be given a `partner` instance, and `n` weeks. The `partner`  has a `.response` method, and the responses may be: `\"positive\"` or `\"neutral\"`. You can try to get a response once a day, thus you have `n * 7` tries in total to find the main love language of your partner!\n\n```if-not:haskell\nThe love languages are: `\"words\", \"acts\", \"gifts\", \"time\", \"touch\"` (available predefined as `LOVE_LANGUAGES`)\n```\n```if:haskell\nThe love languages are: `Words, Acts, Gifts, Time, Touch` ( available `Preloaded` as `LoveLanguage` )\n```\n\n#### Notes:\n\n* Your partner will sometimes give a positive response to any love language (a \"false positive\"), but the main one has a much higher possibility. On the other hand, you may get a neutral response even for the correct language, but with a low possibility (a \"false negative\").\n* There will be 50 tests. There is a slight chance (about 0.5%) to fail a test even with a proper solution, due to the randomness. So if you get 49/50, just run the tests again.\n\n### Examples\n\n```python\nmain love language: \"words\"\n\npartner.response(\"words\")  -->  \"positive\"\npartner.response(\"acts\")   -->  \"neutral\"\npartner.response(\"words\")  -->  \"positive\"\npartner.response(\"time\")   -->  \"neutral\"\npartner.response(\"acts\")   -->  \"positive\"    # false positive\npartner.response(\"gifts\")  -->  \"neutral\"\npartner.response(\"words\")  -->  \"neutral\"     # false negative\netc.\n```\n```haskell\nmain love language: Words\n\nresponse Words partner  ->  Positive\nresponse Acts  partner  ->  Neutral\nresponse Words partner  ->  Positive\nresponse Time  partner  ->  Neutral\nresponse Acts  partner  ->  Positive    -- false positive\nresponse Gifts partner  ->  Neutral\nresponse Words partner  ->  Neutral     -- false negative\netc.\n```\n\n~~~if:haskell\n## Notes\n\n`Preloaded` exports the following:\n\n```haskell\ndata LoveLanguage = Words | Acts | Gifts | Time | Touch deriving (Show,Eq,Ord,Enum,Bounded)\ndata Reaction     = Neutral | Positive                  deriving (Show,Eq,Ord,Enum,Bounded)\ntype Partner\nresponse :: LoveLanguage -> Partner -> IO Reaction\n```\n~~~\n\nHappy coding, and **DO** try this at home! :-)\n\n---\n\n### My other katas\n\nIf you enjoyed this kata then please try [my other katas](https://www.codewars.com/collections/katas-created-by-anter69)! :-)\n\n#### *Translations are welcome!*",
