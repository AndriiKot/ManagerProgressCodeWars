  "description": "As we all know, statements are highly overrated. So specially for you we have this series of challenges, to show off your coding skills that you need no stinking statements (except for `return`). You want to impress your ma, don't you?\n\nThis second part is about the `while` statement. Show off how you could easily implement `while` without using any other statements, completing the initial code so that it passes all tests.\n\nYou might want to first solve the first part if you find this too challenging to start with : <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/625a9ee6a071210017c8a336/c\">Look Ma, No Statements! - Part 1</a>\n\n(Note that the initial code contains statement keywords, which are not allowed in the final solution)\n\n<div align='center'><img src=\"https://github.com/nomennescio/codewars/raw/main/img/look-ma-no-hands.png\" stylr=\"middle\"></div>",
