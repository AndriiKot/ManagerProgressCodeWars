  "description": "In metaprogramming we'll sometimes define a method at runtime, and therefore won't know its name beforehand. Your task is to write a method that takes two arguments: an object, and a method name. \n\nThe given method name will always be a symbol, and the receiving object will always know how to respond to the given method. The given method will never require any arguments.\n\nYour method should return the result of calling `method` on `obj`.\n\nFor example, the following method call...\n\n`dynamic_caller('zaphod!', :upcase)`\n\n... should return `ZAPHOD!`",
