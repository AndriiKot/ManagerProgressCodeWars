  "description": "I have started studying electronics recently, and I came up with a circuit made up of 2 LEDs and 3 buttons.\n\nHere 's how it works: 2 buttons (`red` and `blue`) are connected to the LEDs (`red` and `blue` respectively). Buttons pressing pattern will be remembered and represented through the LEDs when the third button is pressed.\n\n - Only one LED can blink at a time.\n - The LED will only blink once even if the button is held down.\n - The button must be released to be pressed again.\n - If a button is pressed while the other button is being held down, it will be ignored.\n - If two buttons are pressed simultaneously, the red button will be preferred.\n - If a button is released while the other is being held down, the other 's LED will blink.\n - `0` is up and `1` is down.\n - The two inputs will always have the same length.\n \nHere is an example:\n\n```Python\nRed:  \"10011010\"\nBlue: \"10110111\"\n#=> \"RBRB\"\n\nRed:  \"01001000\"\nBlue: \"01011100\"\n#=> \"RB\"\n\nRed:  \"01101000\"\nBlue: \"00111000\"\n#=> \"RB\"\n```\n\nPS:\n\nThis is my first time making a kata, so there may be some errors. \nYou may report to me if the description is too confusing. \nSorry for my poor grammar.\n    \n\n",
