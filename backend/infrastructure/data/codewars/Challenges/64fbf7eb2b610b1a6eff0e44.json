  "description": "### Task\nA new 'hacky' phone is launched, which has the feature of connecting to any Wi-Fi network from any distance away, as long as there aren't any obstructions between the hotspot and the phone. Given a string, return how many Wi-Fi hotspots I'm able to connect to.\n\n* The phone is represented as a `P`.\n* A hotspot is represented as an `*`.\n* An obstruction is represented as a `#`. You cannot access a hotspot if they are behind one of these obstructions.\n\n### Examples\n```python\nnonstop_hotspot(\"*   P  *   *\") ➞ 3\n# No obstructions\n\nnonstop_hotspot(\"*  * #  * P # * #\") ➞ 1\n# Only one wifi available before obstructions\n\nnonstop_hotspot(\"***#P#***\") ➞ 0\n# No access due to obstructions\n```\n\n### Notes\n* There will be only one phone.\n* No other characters, other than spaces, will appear in the tests.",
