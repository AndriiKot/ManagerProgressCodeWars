  "description": "You have been hired by a major MP3 player manufacturer to implement a new music compression standard.\nIn this kata you will implement the ENCODER, and its companion kata deals with the <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/a-simple-music-decoder\">DECODER</a>. It can be considered a harder version of <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/range-extraction\">Range Extraction</a>.\n\n# Specification\nThe input signal is represented as an array of integers. Several cases of regularities can be shortened.\n\n* A sequence of 2 or more identical numbers is shortened as ```number*count```\n* A sequence of 3 or more consecutive numbers is shortened as ```first-last```. This is true for both ascending and descending order\n* A sequence of 3 or more numbers with the same interval is shortened as ```first-last/interval```. Note that the interval does NOT need a sign\n* Compression happens left to right\n\n# Examples\n* ```[1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20]```\n  is compressed to\n  ```\"1,3-5,7-11,14,15,17-20\"```\n* ```[0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]```\n  is compressed to\n  ```\"0-4/2,5,7-9\"```\n* ```[0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 6, 5]```\n  is compressed to\n  ```\"0-4/2,5,7-5\"```\n* ```[0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]```\n  is compressed to\n  ```\"0-4/2,5,7-5,5*4\"```\n\n# Input\nA non-empty array of integers\n\n# Output\nA string of comma-separated integers and sequence descriptors\n",
