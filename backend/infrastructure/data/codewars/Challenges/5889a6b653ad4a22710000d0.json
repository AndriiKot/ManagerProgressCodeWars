  "description": "## Task\n\nGiven a square `matrix`, your task is to reverse the order of elements on both of its longest diagonals.\n\nThe longest diagonals of a square matrix are defined as follows:\n* the first longest diagonal goes from the top left corner to the bottom right one;\n* the second longest diagonal goes from the top right corner to the bottom left one.\n\n\n## Example\n\nFor the matrix\n```\n1, 2, 3\n4, 5, 6\n7, 8, 9\n```\nthe output should be:\n```\n9, 2, 7\n4, 5, 6\n3, 8, 1\n```\n\n\n## Input/Output\n\n\n- `[input]` 2D integer array `matrix`\n\n   Constraints: `1 ≤ matrix.length ≤ 10, matrix.length = matrix[i].length, 1 ≤ matrix[i][j] ≤ 1000`\n\n\n- `[output]` 2D integer array\n\n   Matrix with the order of elements on its longest diagonals reversed.",
