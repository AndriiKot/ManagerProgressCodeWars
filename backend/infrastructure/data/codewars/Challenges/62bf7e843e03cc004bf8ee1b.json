  "description": "# Biggest of the Smallest of the Biggest of the...\n\n## Your Task:\n\nYou are given an array `arr` of integers, and a string `str` that contains steps to extract an array out of `arr`.\n\n`str` contains a chained combination of `\"the biggest\"` and `\"the smallest\"` inside it. An example would be `\"the biggest of the smallest of the biggest of the biggest\"`. At each step in `str`, extract either the biggest or the smallest values from `arr`, and continue to the next step with the extracted values.\n\n## Example:\n\nGiven the array `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]` and the string `\"the biggest of the smallest\"`, you should return `[3,4]`. The first step in `str` is `\"the smallest\"`, and the smallest of the array is `[1,2,3,4]`. You then proceed to the next step in `str` with this extracted array, `[1,2,3,4]`. The next step in `str` is `\"the biggest\"`, and the biggest of `[1,2,3,4]` is `[3,4]`.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nIf you are given an empty array, return an empty array.\n\nIf you are given an empty string, return the original array.\n\nIf at any step the length of the array becomes one, return the array.\n\nIf at any step the length of the array is odd, then `\"the biggest\"` part takes the middle element. For example, when taking `\"the biggest\"` of `[1,2,3]`, your extracted array should be `[2,3]` and when taking `\"the smallest\"` your array should be `[1]`.\n\nThe integers inside the array that you return need to be in the same order that they were in the original array. `\"the biggest\"` and `\"the smallest\"` are not referring to the start and end of the array, but to the size of the integers inside the array. When taking `\"the biggest\"` of `[5,3,9,1,2,4]`, your code should return `[5,9,4]`, as they are the biggest integers in the array.\n\nThere may be duplicate integers inside the array, in which case the duplicate integers that come first are prioritized. When taking `\"the biggest\"` of `[4,5,4,4]`, your code should return `[4,5]`, not `[5,4]`.\n\n## More Examples:\n\nGiven the array `[23,567,33,13,67,43,678,9,1,56]` and the string `\"the smallest of the biggest\"`, you should return `[43,56]` because `\"the biggest\"` is `[567,67,43,678,56]`, and `\"the smallest\"` of that is `[43,56].`\n\nGiven the array `[4]` and the string `\"the biggest of the smallest\"`, you should return `[4]` because the array has only one element.\n\nThe `\"biggest of the smallest of the smallest\"` of `[7,8,9]` is `[7]`: `[7,8,9]`->`[7]`->`[7]`.\n\nGood luck!",
