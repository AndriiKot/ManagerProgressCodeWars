  "description": "Down in Fraggle Rock, the gorgs are working on their farm of radishes. They begin to notice that the fraggles have been stealing their radishes, so they set up traps to catch them. The gorgs, however, are not very smart and have been caught up in their traps quite a few times. They have to put out signs in front of every radish, telling their fellow gorgs whether the radish is \"safe\" (no trap) or \"unsafe\" (trap!). \n\nGobo and Wembley, our fraggle heroes, need our help. The gorgs are using a Caesar Cipher (also known as a shift cipher) to encrypt their signs, but they've added a twist. Can you figure it out?\n\nYour function should only return \"safe\" or \"unsafe\". You will always be passed a valid string of encrypted alpha characters.\n\nHint: It's not as simple as just the word length!\n\n<div style=\"width: 320px; text-align: center; color: white; border: white 1px solid;\">\nCheck out my other 80's Kids Katas:\n</div>\n<div>\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-1-how-many-licks-does-it-take'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #1:</span> How Many Licks Does It Take</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-2-help-alf-find-his-spaceship'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #2:</span> Help Alf Find His Spaceship</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-3-punky-brewsters-socks'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #3:</span> Punky Brewster's Socks</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-4-legends-of-the-hidden-temple'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #4:</span> Legends of the Hidden Temple</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-5-you-cant-do-that-on-television'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #5:</span> You Can't Do That on Television</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-6-rock-em-sock-em-robots'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #6:</span> Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em Robots</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-7-shes-a-small-wonder'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #7:</span> She's a Small Wonder</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-8-the-secret-world-of-alex-mack'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #8:</span> The Secret World of Alex Mack</a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-9-down-in-fraggle-rock'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #9:</span> Down in Fraggle Rock </a><br />\n\n<a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/80-s-kids-number-10-captain-planet'><span style='color:#00C5CD'>80's Kids #10:</span> Captain Planet </a><br />\n\n\n</div>\n",
