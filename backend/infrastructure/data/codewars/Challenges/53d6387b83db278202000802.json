  "description": "You have an array of numbers 1 through n (where 1 <= n <= 10). The array needs to be formatted correctly for the person reading the countdown of a spaceship launch.\n\nUnfortunately, the person reading the countdown only knows how to read strings.  After the array is sorted correctly make sure it's in a format he can understand.\n\nBetween each number should be a space and after the final number (n) should be the word 'liftoff!'\n\nExample:\n```ruby\n# Given\ninstructions = [8,1,10,2,7,9,6,3,4,5]\n# Should return\n\"10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 liftoff!\"\n```\n```javascript\n// Given\ninstructions = [8,1,10,2,7,9,6,3,4,5]\n// Should return\n\"10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 liftoff!\"\n// Given\ninstructions = [1,2,4,3,5]\n// Should return\n\"5 4 3 2 1 liftoff!\"\n```\n```csharp\nKata.Liftoff(new List<int> {2, 8, 10, 9, 1, 3, 4, 7, 6, 5}) => \"10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 liftoff!\"\n```",
