  "description": "There is a common problem given to interviewees in software, called FizzBuzz. It works as follows: for the numbers between 1 and 100, print \"fizz\" if it is a multiple of 3 and \"buzz\" if it is a mutiple of 5, else print the number itself.\n\nYou are in an interview and they ask you to complete fizzbuzz (which can be done in a one-liner in a few langs) and you knock it out of the park.\n\n## Task ##\n\nSurprised by your ability, the interviewer gives you a harder problem. Given a list of coprime numbers, (that is that the greatest common divisor of all the numbers = 1) and an equally sized list of words, compute its fizzbuzz representation up until the pattern of strings repeats itself. \n\n**Notes:**\n * Your function should return a list/array, not print it.\n * The list of numbers should start from 1.\n * The strings are always concatenated from left to right in the appearance of the given list of words.\n * The list of numbers may not always be sorted - just use the given order of the numbers.\n * All numbers in the first array will always be coprime. This is a safe assumption for your program.\n * The list stops where it does because if you were to filter the numbers out, the remaining strings would repeat after this point.\n \n*Hint:* What is the relation to the numbers given in the list and the length of the list?\n\n\n## Example ##\n```\nfizzbuzz_plusplus([2, 3, 5], ['fizz', 'buzz', 'bazz'])\n```\nshould return\n```\n[1, 'fizz', 'buzz', 'fizz', 'bazz', 'fizzbuzz', 7, 'fizz', 'buzz', 'fizzbazz', 11, 'fizzbuzz', 13, 'fizz', 'buzzbazz', 'fizz', 17, 'fizzbuzz', 19, 'fizzbazz', 'buzz', 'fizz', 23, 'fizzbuzz', 'bazz', 'fizz', 'buzz', 'fizz', 29 , 'fizzbuzzbazz']\n```\n",
