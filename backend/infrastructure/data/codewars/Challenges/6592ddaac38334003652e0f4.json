  "description": "Your task is to write and execute a SQL query that illustrates the various stages in a developer's career, along with their associated attributes.\n\nWe have `developer_attributes` table with the following columns:\n* `developer_title`: A String column representing the title of the developer (e.g., Trainee, Junior, Middle, Senior, Architect).\n* `attribute`: A String column representing an attribute of the developer at that level.\n\nWrite a SQL query that does the following:\n1) Selects and highlights each distinct `developer_title` from the table.\n2) Lists the attributes associated with each title below it.\n3) The output should be ordered by the developer title and then by the attributes - both in ascending alphabetical order.\n\nIn your result set, use the column name `description` to display the data. \nDeveloper titles should be distinctively formatted to stand out. Enclose them in whitespaces and asterisks like `*** Trainee ***`.\n\nThe output should be a list where each developer title is followed by its respective attributes, clearly differentiating between the titles and their attributes.\n\n\n#### Desired Output\n\nThe desired output should look like this:\n\n<table><!----><tr><th>description</th></tr><tr><td>*** Architect ***</td></tr><tr><td>Attends meetings about meetings</td></tr><tr><td>Draws diagrams on napkins</td></tr><tr><td>*** Junior ***</td></tr><tr><td>Celebrates first pull request</td></tr><tr><td>Writes \"Hello World\" in 5 languages</td></tr><tr><td>*** Middle ***</td></tr><tr><td>Debugs with print statements</td></tr><tr><td>Googles Stack Overflow answers</td></tr><tr><td>*** Senior ***</td></tr><tr><td>Has more coffee than blood</td></tr><tr><td>Refactors code in sleep</td></tr><tr><td>*** Trainee ***</td></tr><tr><td>Asks \"What is Git?\"</td></tr><tr><td>Constantly searches for \"How to program\"</td></tr></table>\n\nGLHF!\n\n\n",
