  "description": "In the online streaming platform users watch various videos and create playlists of their favorite content. The platform wants to identify engaged users who have explored and watched more than two different videos. This information will help platform to provide personalized recommendations and enhance the user experience.\n\nYou are working with PostgreSQL DB and being provided with a table named `user_playlist` containing the historical playlist data for users. The table has the following structure:\n\n* `user_id`: An integer representing the unique identifier of the user.\n* `video_id`: An integer representing the unique identifier of the video.\n* `time`: A timestamp representing the date and time when the user watched the video.\n\nThe table might have multiple entries for the same user watching the same video.\n\nYou got the following specification from the management:\n\n* Your query should return only the users who have watched more than two different videos.\n* The result should list the `user_id` and the `video_id` they have watched.\n* Duplicate combinations of user and video should be avoided in the result.\n* The result should be ordered by `user_id` in ascending order and by `video_id` also in ascending order\n\nHaving experience in Oracle, you wrote the solution:\n\n```sql\nselect user_id, video_id\nfrom (select user_id, video_id, count(distinct video_id) over (partition by user_id) as cnt\n      from user_playlist\n     ) t     \nwhere cnt > 2\norder by user_id, video_id;\n```\n\nBut [NANI...?!](https://youtu.be/pKO9UjSeLew?t=92)\n\nIt appeared that Postgres does not support `DISTINCT` for window functions. \n\nYou already ordered a pizza that is waiting for you to brighten up the end of a hard day's work but instead you have to rewrite the query while the pizza is cooling down because damn Postgres does not support such a basic feature.\n\nGLHF!\n",
