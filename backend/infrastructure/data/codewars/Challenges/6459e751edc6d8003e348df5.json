  "description": "Write a PostgreSQL query that selects `film_id`, the `title` and `special_features` columns from the film table in the DVD rental database, and returns all films that have a unique combination of special features, regardless of the order of these features in the `special_features` array.\n\n##### Notes:\n\n*  for the sample tests, static dump of [DVD Rental Sample Database](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/) is used, for the final solution - random tests.\n* The result should be ordered by title alphabetically, if title is the same - then by film_id in asc order.\n* by unique is meant that a film has a special features array that doesn't match any other special features array in the `film` table.\n* by `regardless of the order` is meant that, for example, `{Trailers, Deleted Scenes}` and `{Deleted Scenes, Trailers}` is the same array. We are interested only in fully unique set of features\n\n### Schema:\n\n#### `film` table:\n```\nColumn            | Type      | Modifiers\n------------------+-----------+-----------\nfilm_id           | integer   | not null\ntitle             | varchar   | not null\ndescription       | text      | not null\nrelease_year      | integer   | not null\nlanguage_id       | integer   | not null \nrental_duration   | integer   | not null\nrental_rate       | numeric   | not null\nlength            | integer   | not null\nreplacement_cost  | numeric   | not null\nrating            | varchar   | not null\nlast_update       | timestamp | not null\nspecial_features  | text[]    | not null\n```\n\n### Desired Output\n\nThe desired output should look like this:\n```\nfilm_id | title                             | special_features                       |\n--------+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------|\n   32   | A Shawshank Redemption            | {Trailers, Deleted Scenes}             | \n   14   | Monty Python and the Holy Grail   | {Trailers}                             |\n...\n```",
