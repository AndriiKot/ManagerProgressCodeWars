  "description": "You have an amount of money `a0 > 0` and you deposit it with an interest rate of `p percent divided by 360` *per day* on the `1st of January 2016`. You want to have an amount `a >= a0`.\n\n#### Task:\nThe function `date_nb_days` (or dateNbDays...) with parameters `a0, a, p` will return, as a string, the date on which you have just reached `a`.\n\n#### Example:\n`date_nb_days(100, 101, 0.98) --> \"2017-01-01\" (366 days)`\n\n`date_nb_days(100, 150, 2.00) --> \"2035-12-26\" (7299 days)`\n\n#### Notes:\n- The return format of the date is `\"YYYY-MM-DD\"`\n- The deposit is always on the `\"2016-01-01\"`\n- Don't forget to take the rate for a day to be `p divided by 36000` since banks consider that there are `360` days in a year.\n- You have: `a0 > 0, p% > 0, a >= a0`",
