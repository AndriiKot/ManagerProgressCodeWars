  "description": "# Four Seven\n\n```if:python\nSimple kata, simple rules: your function should accept the inputs `4` and `7`.  If `4` is entered, the function should return `7`.  If `7` is entered, the function should return `4`.  Anything else entered as input should return a false-y value such as `False`, `0`, `[]`, `\"\"`. There's only one catch, your function cannot include if statements (or the eval function due to the fact that you can get around the if requirement using it).\n\nThere are some *very* simple ways of answering this problem, but I encourage you to try and be as creative as possible.\n\nGood Luck!\n```\n```if:java,csharp\nSimple kata, simple rules: your function should accept the inputs `4` and `7`.
