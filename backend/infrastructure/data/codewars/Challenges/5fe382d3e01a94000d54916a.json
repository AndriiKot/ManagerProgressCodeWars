  "description": "### History\n\nYou are a great investigator.  You are spending Christmas holidays with your family when you receive a series of postcards.  \nAt first glance the text on the postcards doesn't make sense (why send random quotes?), but after a closer look you notice something strange.  \n\n*Maybe there is a hidden message!*\n\n\n### Technical details\n\nYour task is to create a class `Investigator` with at least these two methods:\n- `postcard(self, text)` - analyzes `text` (a string); return value doesn't matter.\n- `hidden_message(self)` - returns the hidden message (a string).\n   \nTypical usage:\n```python\ninvestigator = ... # new instance of Investigator\ninvestigator.postcard(text of first postcard)\ninvestigator.postcard(text of second postcard)\ninvestigator.postcard(...)\ninvestigator.postcard(text of last postcard)\ninvestigator.hidden_message()  # return value is checked\n# investigator goes out of scope\n```\n\n- 1-15 postcards per instance\n- one hidden message per instance\n",
