  "description": "`data`and `data1` are two strings with rainfall records of a few cities for months from January to December.\nThe records of towns are separated by `\\n`. The name of each town is followed by `:`. \n\n`data` and `towns` can be seen in \"Your Test Cases:\".\n\n#### Task:\n- function: `mean(town, strng)` should return the average of rainfall for the city `town` and the `strng` `data` or `data1` (In R and Julia this function is called `avg`).\n- function: `variance(town, strng)` should return the variance of rainfall for the city `town` and the `strng` `data` or `data1`.\n\n#### Examples:\n\n```\nmean(\"London\", data), 51.19(9999999999996) \nvariance(\"London\", data), 57.42(833333333374)\n```\n\n#### Notes:\n- if functions `mean` or `variance` have as parameter `town` a city which has no records return `-1` or `-1.0` (depending on the language)\n\n    \n- Don't truncate or round: the tests will pass if `abs(your_result - test_result) <= 1e-2`\nor `abs((your_result - test_result) / test_result) <= 1e-6` depending on the language.\n\n\n- Shell\n  1) Shell tests only variance.\n  2) In \"function \"variance\" $1 is \"data\", $2 is \"town\".\n\n    \n- A ref: <http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html>\n\n\n- `data` and `data1` (can be named `d0` and `d1` depending on the language; see \"Sample Tests:\") are adapted from:  <http://www.worldclimate.com>\n",
