  "description": "Write a function which reduces fractions to their simplest form! Fractions will be presented as an array/tuple (depending on the language) of strictly positive integers, and the reduced fraction must be returned as an array/tuple:\n\n```\ninput:   [numerator, denominator]\noutput:  [reduced numerator, reduced denominator]\nexample: [45, 120] --> [3, 8]\n```\n\nAll numerators and denominators will be positive integers.\n\nNote: This is an introductory Kata for a series... coming soon!\n",
