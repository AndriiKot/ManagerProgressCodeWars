  "description": "The story of the famous Disney-Pixar animated movie \"Up\" is based on the main character Carl Fredricksen journey in his home equipped with balloons. \n\nBut can this happen for real? What kind of objects can you lift with helium balloons? How many balloons do you need?\n\nIn this kata you will create a class \n\n``Journey(object, crew, balloons)``\n\nso anyone can create objects like \n\n``var gravityFalls = new Journey(house, 2, 20622)`` \n\nwhich means starting a new journey to Gravity Falls in a house with 2 members of crew (Carl and Russel). \n\nBut is this journey possible? Will the ``house`` float? Is it enough to have 20622 helium balloons (the number used by Pixar animators in liftoff scene)?\n\nYour ``Journey`` class should have a public method ``isPossible()`` that returns ``true`` or ``false`` based on these rules:\n\n1). Every ``object`` (dictionary in Python) passed to ``Journey`` will have its ``weight`` property like \n\n``var house = {\"weight\": 45000};`` \n\n(we will use metric system in this kata, 45 000 kg is about 100 000 pounds).\n\n2). Each member of the crew weighs 80 kg.\n\n3). We use regular sized party balloons filled with helium. Each balloon lifts 4.8 grams + its own weight.\n\nCan you lift a tiny 95 kg(~200 pound) push cart with 50 balloons like in one of the starting scenes of the movie? \n\nCan one balloon actually carry a message on a single letter-sized paper sheet sent by Carl to his dying wife Ellie in the other scene? \n\nCan the story I heard about man flying in his lawn chair equipped with 1000 balloons be true?\n\nYour coding mastery will reveal answers to these and many other important questions in the tests. Let the journey begin!",
