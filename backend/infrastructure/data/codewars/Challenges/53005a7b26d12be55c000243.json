  "description": "# Simpler Interactive interpreter (or REPL)\n\nYou will create an interpreter which takes inputs described below and produces outputs, storing state in between each input. This is a simplified version of the [Simple Interactive Interpreter](http://www.codewars.com/dojo/katas/52ffcfa4aff455b3c2000750) kata with functions removed, so if you have fun with this kata, check out its big brother to add functions into the mix.\n\nIf you're not sure where to start with this kata, check out [ankr](http://www.codewars.com/users/ankr)'s [Evaluate Mathematical Expression](http://www.codewars.com/dojo/katas/52a78825cdfc2cfc87000005) kata.\n\n**Note that the `eval` command has been disabled.**\n\n## Concepts\n\nThe interpreter will take inputs in the language described under the language header below. This section will give an overview of the language constructs.\n\n### Variables\n\nAny `identifier` which is not a keyword will be treated as a variable. If the identifier is on the left hand side of an assignment operator, the result of the right hand side will be stored in the variable. If a variable occurs as part of an expression, the value held in the variable will be substituted when the expression is evaluated.\n\nVariables are implicitly declared the first time they are assigned to.\n\n**Example:** Initializing a variable to a constant value and using the variable in another expression (Each line starting with a '>' indicates a separate call to the input method of the interpreter, other lines represent output)\n\n```\n>x = 7\n    7\n>x + 6\n    13\t\n```\n\nReferencing a non-existent variable will cause the interpreter to throw an error. The interpreter should be able to continue accepting input even after throwing.\n\n**Example:** Referencing a non-existent variable\n\n```\n>y + 7\n    ERROR: Invalid identifier. No variable with name 'y' was found.\"\n```\n\n### Assignments\n\nAn assignment is an expression that has an identifier on left side of an `=` operator, and any expression on the right. Such expressions should store the value of the right hand side in the specified variable and return the result.\n\n**Example:** Assigning a constant to a variable\n\n```\nx = 7\n    7\n```\n\nIn this kata, all tests will contain only a single assignment. You do not need to consider chained or nested assignments.\n\n### Operator Precedence\n\nOperator precedence will follow the common order. There is a table in the *Language* section below that explicitly states the operators and their relative precedence.\n\n### Name conflicts\n\nBecause variables are declared implicitly, no naming conflicts are possible. variable assignment will always overwrite any existing value.\n\n### Input\n\nInput will conform to the `expression` production in the grammar below.\n\n\n### Output\n\nOutput for a valid expression will be the result of the expression.\n\nOutput for input consisting entirely of whitespace will be an empty string (`null` in case of Java).\n\nAll other cases will throw an error.\n\n## Language\n\n### Grammar\n\nThis section specifies the grammar for the interpreter language in [EBNF syntax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form)\n\n```\nexpression      ::= factor | expression operator expression\nfactor          ::= number | identifier | assignment | '(' expression ')'\nassignment      ::= identifier '=' expression\n\noperator        ::= '+' | '-' | '*' | '/' | '%'\n\nidentifier      ::= letter | '_' { identifier-char }\nidentifier-char ::= '_' | letter | digit\n\nnumber          ::= { digit } [ '.' digit { digit } ]\n\nletter          ::= 'a' | 'b' | ... | 'y' | 'z' | 'A' | 'B' | ... | 'Y' | 'Z'\ndigit           ::= '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'\n```\n\n### Operator Precedence\n\nThe following table lists the language's operators grouped in order of precedence. Operators within each group have equal precedence.\n\nCategory  | Operators\n------------- | -------------\nMultiplicative  | *, /, %\nAdditive  | +, -\nAssignment | =\n",
