  "description": "Everybody knows the classic [\"half your age plus seven\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#%22Half-your-age-plus-seven%22_rule) dating rule that a lot of people follow (including myself). It's the 'recommended' age range in which to date someone. \n\n<!-- Original link is dead.\n<img src=\"http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/age-range-compatibility-equation.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n-->\n\n<!-- archive.org link image as backup.\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20190206114947if_/http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/age-range-compatibility-equation.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n-->\n\n\n* `$\\text{Min} = \\dfrac{ \\text{Age} } {2} + 7$`\n\n* `$\\text{Max} = 2 \\cdot (\\text{Age - 7})$`\n\n* `$\\text{Minimum age} \\le \\text{Your age} \\le \\text{Maximum age}$`\n\n\n## Task\n\nGiven an integer (1 <= n <= 100) representing a person's age, return their minimum and maximum age range.\n\nThis equation doesn't work when the age <= 14, so if the age <= 14, use this equation instead:\n\n```\nmin = age - 0.10 * age\nmax = age + 0.10 * age\n```\n\nYou should floor all your answers so that an integer is given instead of a float (which doesn't represent age). Return your answer in the form ```\"[min]-[max]\"```\n\n\n## Examples:\n\n```\nage = 27   =>   \"20-40\"\nage = 5    =>   \"4-5\"\nage = 17   =>   \"15-20\"\n```\n",
