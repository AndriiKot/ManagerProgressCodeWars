  "description": "As part of streamlining the hiring process at tech company, we aim to categorize all job applications into two distinct groups based on their evaluation status:\n\n1) `Rejected`: Applications where the candidate did not meet the necessary criteria for the role, including technical skills, company cultural fit, or other qualifications as determined by the hiring team.\n2) `Approved`: Applications where the candidate successfully met or exceeded the evaluation criteria and are considered strong candidates for the next stages of the hiring process.\n\nTo achieve this, we use the `applications` table, where each application has a status represented by the `application_status` column. A status value of 5 or lower indicates a rejected application, while a status value greater than 5 indicates an approved application.\n\n`applications`: \n\n* `application_id` (int): primary key\n* `application_status`: The status of the job application, represented by an integer.\n\nResult Set Columns:\n\n1) `status_group`: This column categorizes the applications into two groups: 'Rejected' and 'Approved'. We display 'Rejected' at first. The categorization is based on the value of the `application_status` column in the applications table:\n    * 'Rejected': Applications with an `application_status` value of 5 or lower.\n    * 'Approved': Applications with an `application_status` value greater than 5.\n2) `application_num`: The number of applications in each status group. This column provides a count of applications that fall into the 'Rejected' or 'Approved' categories.\n\nWe always have to see both categories in the results, even if one or both of the counts is zero.\n\nFor this sample data:\n\n```\n| application_id | application_status |\n+----------------+--------------------+\n| 1              | 3                  |\n| 2              | 6                  |\n| 3              | 4                  |\n| 4              | 7                  |\n| 5              | 5                  |\n| 6              | 8                  |\n| 7              | 2                  |\n| 8              | 9                  |\n```\n\n\nthe expected output of the query is following:\n\n```\n| status_group  | application_num|\n+---------------+----------------+\n| Rejected      | 4              |\n| Approved      | 4              |\n```\n\nGLHF!\n",
