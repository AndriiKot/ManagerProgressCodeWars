  "description": "We have to find the longest substring of identical characters in a very long string. \n\nLet's see an example:\n```\ns1 = \"1111aa994bbbb1111AAAAAFF?<mmMaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabf\"\n```\nThe longest substring in ```s1``` is ```\"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\"``` having a length of ```25```, made of character, \"a\", with its corresponding ascii code equals to ```\"97\"```, and having its starting index ```29``` and the ending one ```53```.\n\nWe express the results using an array in the following order:\n```[\"97\", 25, [29,53]]```\n\nThe symbols ```'!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\\\]^_`{|}~'``` that a string may have will be considered as noise, so they cannot be  a solution even though the substring, made of one of them, is the longest of all. In other words, the allowed characters may be the uppercase or lower letters of the English alphabet or the decimal digits (```'0123456789'```)\n\nLet's see an example to show what happens if we have non alphanumeric symbols.\n\n```s2 = \"1111aa994bbbb1111AAAAAFF????????????????????????????\"```\nThe longest substring is ```\"AAAAA\"``` so the result for it is:\n```\n['65', 5, [17, 21]]\n```\nIf there are two or more substrings with the maximum length value, it will be chosen the one that starts first, from left to right.\n\nMake an agile code that may output an array like the one shown above when it receives a huge string.\n\nFeatures of the random tests:\n```\nnumber of tests = 210\nlength of the strings up to a bit more than:\n10.000.000 (python and javascript)\n6.000.000 (ruby)\n```",
