  "description": "<h1>5command</h1>\n<p>\n5command is an Esoteric programming language which has 5 commands, Your task is to create an interpreter for a 5command input. The FiveCommands class is provided and a function called read which will be used.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Commands</h2>\n<p>\nThe five possible commands in the 5command language:<br>\n\n<strong>+</strong> ```move the pointer right on the tape``` <br>\n<strong>-</strong> ```move the pointer left on the tape```<br>\n<strong>^</strong> ```increment the value on the tape where the pointer is currently```<br>\n<strong>v</strong> ```decrement the value on the tape where the pointer is currently```<br>\n<strong>*</strong> ```print to tape the number at the pointer (without a space);```<br>\n</p>\n\n<h2>Important</h2>\n\nEach time `*` is called you must add the number at the pointer to the output variable which will then be returned as a number when the program has finished.\n\nThe tape used is unlimited so everytime the pointer is at ```0``` and the program asks you to minus one from the pointer or go to ```-1``` on the tape just expand the tape at the start.\n\n\n<h2>Input</h2>\n\nYou should expect input only for the read function inside the Interpreter class which will take two parameters: ```input``` and ```debug```. \n<br><br>Input will be a string of possible commands for example: ```^*```. \n<br><br>Debug will be a boolean either true or false which will determine if a debug value is returned. If it is false then return an empty array.\n\n\n<h2>Output</h2>\n\nThe output expected for this kata will be an object this object will be predefined in the solution called ```Output``` It takes two properties: ```output``` and ```debug```. The output must be the result of the input as a string. The debug must then be an array representation of the tape (examples below).\n\n\n\n\nOutput class definition.\n```javascript\nclass Output {\n  constructor(out, debug){\n    this.output = out;\n    this.debug = debug;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n<h4>Simple Program</h4>\n \n`^*`\n\nNormal Mode should output:\n``` \noutput: 1\n```\nDebug Mode should output:\n```javascript \noutput: '1'\ndebug: ['0->1']\n```\n\n<br><br>\n<strong>Reference:</strong> <a href=\"https://esolangs.org/wiki/5command\">5command</a>\n<div value=\"https://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list\"></div>",
