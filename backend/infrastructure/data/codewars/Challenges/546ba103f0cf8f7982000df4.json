  "description": "In this kata you need to write a function that will receive two strings (```n1``` and ```n2```), each representing an integer as a binary number. A third parameter will be provided (```o```) as a string representing one of the following operators: add, subtract, multiply.\n\nYour task is to write the calculate function so that it will perform the arithmetic and the result returned should be a string representing the binary result.\n\nExamples:\n```\n1 + 1 === 10\n10 + 10 === 100\n```\n\nNegative binary numbers are usually preceded by several 1's. For this kata, negative numbers can be represented with the negative symbol at the beginning of the string.\n\nExamples of negatives:\n```\n1 - 10 === -1\n10 - 100 === -10\n```",
