The output should be an array of the sum  in a similar fashion to the input (for example, if the sum is `341`, you would return `[3,4,1]`). Examples are given below of what two arrays should return.\n```python\n[3,2,9],[1,2] --> [3,4,1]\n[4,7,3],[1,2,3] --> [5,9,6]\n[1],[5,7,6] --> [5,7,7]\n```\n```ruby\n[3,2,9],[1,2] --> [3,4,1]\n[4,7,3],[1,2,3] --> [5,9,6]\n[1],[5,7,6] --> [5,7,7]\n```\n```rust\n[3, 2, 9], [1, 2]    // [3, 4, 1]\n[4, 7, 3], [1, 2, 3] // [5, 9, 6]\n[1], [5, 7, 6]       // [5, 7, 7]\n```\n```java\n{3,2,9} + {1,2}   = {3,4,1}\n{4,7,3} + {1,2,3} = {5,9,6}\n{1}     + {5,7,6} = {5,7,7}\n```\n```c\n{3,2,9} + {1,2}   = {3,4,1}\n{4,7,3} + {1,2,3} = {5,9,6}\n{1}     + {5,7,6} = {5,7,7}\n```\n```cpp\n{3,2,9} + {1,2}   = {3,4,1}\n{4,7,3} + {1,2,3} = {5,9,6}\n{1}     + {5,7,6} = {5,7,7}\n```\n```nasm\n{3,2,9} + {1,2}   = {3,4,1}\n{4,7,3} + {1,2,3} = {5,9,6}\n{1}     + {5,7,6} = {5,7,7}\n```\n\nIf both arrays are empty, return an empty array.\n\nIn some cases, there will be an array containing a negative number as the first index in the array. In this case treat the whole number as a negative number. See below:\n```python\n[3,2,6,6],[-7,2,2,8] --> [-3,9,6,2] # 3266 + (-7228) = -3962\n```\n```ruby\n[3,2,6,6],[-7,2,2,8] --> [-3,9,6,2] # 3266 + (-7228) = -3962\n```\n```rust\n[3, 2, 6, 6], [-7, 2, 2, 8] // [-3, 9, 6, 2] as 3266 + (-7228) = -3962\n```\n```java\n{3,2,6,6} + {-7,2,2,8} = {-3,9,6,2} // 3266 + (-7228) = -3962\n```\n```c\n{3,2,6,6} + {-7,2,2,8} = {-3,9,6,2} // 3266 + (-7228) = -3962\n```\n```cpp\n{3,2,6,6} + {-7,2,2,8} = {-3,9,6,2} // 3266 + (-7228) = -3962\n```\n```nasm\n{3,2,6,6} + {-7,2,2,8} = {-3,9,6,2} // 3266 + (-7228) = -3962\n```\n",
