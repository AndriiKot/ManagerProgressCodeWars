  "description": "Consider a pyramid made up of blocks. Each layer of the pyramid is a rectangle of blocks, and the dimensions of these rectangles increment as you descend the pyramid. So, if a layer is a `3x6` rectangle of blocks, then the next layer will be a `4x7` rectangle of blocks. A `1x10` layer will be on top of a `2x11` layer on top of a `3x12` layer, and so on.\n\n## Task\n\nGiven the dimensions of a pyramid's topmost layer `w,l`, and its height `h` (aka the number of layers), return the total number of blocks in the pyramid.\n\n## Examples\n\n`num_blocks(1, 1, 2)` will return `5`. This pyramid starts with a `1x1` layer and has 2 layers total. So, there is 1 block in the first layer, and `2x2=4` blocks in the second. Thus, 5 is the total number of blocks.\n\n`num_blocks(2, 4, 3)` will return `47`. This pyramid has 3 layers: `2x4`, `3x5`, and `4x6`. So, there are `47` blocks total.\n\n## Notes\n\nAll parameters will always be postive nonzero integers.\n\nEfficiency is important. There will be:\n\n* 100 'small' cases with `w`, `l`, and `h` below `20`.\n* 100 'big' cases with `w`, `l`, and `h` between `1e9` and `1e10`.",
