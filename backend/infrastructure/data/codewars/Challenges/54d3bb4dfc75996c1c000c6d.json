  "description": "----\nMidpoint Sum\n----\n\nFor a given list of integers, return the index of the element where the sums of the integers to the left and right of the current element are equal.\n\nEx:\n```python\nints = [4, 1, 7, 9, 3, 9]\n# Since 4 + 1 + 7 = 12 and 3 + 9 = 12, the returned index would be 3\n\nints = [1, 0, -1]\n# Returns None/nil/undefined/etc (depending on the language) as there\n# are no indices where the left and right sums are equal\n```\n\n__Here are the 2 important rules:__\n\n1. The element at the index to be returned is __not__ included in either of the sum calculations!\n2. Both the first and last index __cannot__ be considered as a \"midpoint\" (So ```None``` for ```[X]``` and ```[X, X]```)\n```if:python\n3. For python, return `-1` if there exists no such index\n```\n",
