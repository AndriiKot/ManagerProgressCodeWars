  "description": "<p>We have 3 equations with 3 unknowns <code>x, y, and z</code> and we are to solve for these unknowns.</p>\n<p>Equations <code>4x -3y +z = -10</code>, <code>2x +y +3z = 0</code>, and <code>-x +2y -5z = 17</code> will be passed in as an array of <code>[[4, -3, 1, -10], [2, 1, 3, 0], [-1, 2, -5, 17]]</code> and the result should be returned as an array like <code>[1, 4, -2]</code> (i.e. <code>[x, y, z]</code>).</p>\n\nNote: In C++ do not use <code>new</code> or <code>malloc</code> to allocate memory for the returned variable as allocated memory will not be freed in the Test Cases. Setting the variable as <code>static</code> will do.\n",
