  "description": "In this kata, you need to implement three functions that take an integer `n` and return its prime factorization in different formats.\n\n\n## Function 1: Get All Prime Factors\n\nWrite a function that returns an array containing its prime decomposition in ascending order. If a factor appears multiple times in the decomposition, it should appear as many times in the result.\n\n**Example:** For `n = 100`, return `[2, 2, 5, 5]` in this order\n\n\n## Function 2: Get Unique Prime Factors With Count\n\nWrite a function that returns an array containing two arrays:\n- The first contains the unique prime factors appearing in the decomposition (in ascending order)\n- The second contains their respective powers (same order as their corresponding prime factors)\n\n**Example:** For `n = 100`, return `[[2, 5], [2, 2]]`\n\n\n## Function 3: Get Unique Prime Factors With Products / Get Prime Factor Potencies (if Java)\n\nWrite a function that returns an array containing each prime factor raised to its respective power. The results should be ordered according to their **prime factors** in ascending order.\n\n**Example:** For `n = 100`, return `[4, 25]` (`$ 2^2 = 4$` and `$5^2 = 25$`)\n\n\n---\n\n\n# Invalid Value Handling\n\nIf:\n\n* `n` is not a number\n* `n` not an integer \n* `n` is negative or 0 \n\nThe three functions should respectively return `[]`,  `[[],[]]` and `[]`. \n\n---\n\n# Edge cases\n\n* if `n = 0`, the functions should respectively return `[]`, `[[],[]]` and  `[]`.\n* if `n = 1`, the functions should respectively return `[1]`, `[[1],[1]]`, `[1]`.\n* if `n = 2`, the functions should respectively return `[2]`, `[[2],[1]]`, `[2]`.\n\n**Note:** The result for `n = 2` follows standard prime factorization. The result for `n = 1` is arbitrary and has been chosen to return a useful result. The result for `n = 0` is also arbitrary but cannot be both useful and intuitive (`[[0], [0]]` would be meaningful but won't work for general decomposition use; `[[0], [1]]` would work but is not intuitive).\n",
