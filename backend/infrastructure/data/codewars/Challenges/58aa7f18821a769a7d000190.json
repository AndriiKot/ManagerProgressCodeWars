  "description": "# Task\n Alireza and Ali have a `3×3 table` and playing on that. They have 4 tables (2×2) A,B,C and D in this table.\n \n At beginning all of 9 numbers in 3×3 table is zero.\n \n Alireza in each move choose a 2×2 table from A, B, C and D and increase all of 4 numbers in that by one.\n \n He asks Ali, how much he increase table A, B, C and D. (if he cheats you should return `[-1]`)\n \n Your task is to help Ali.\n\n# Example\n\n For \n ```\ntable=\n[[1,2,1],\n[2,4,2],\n[1,2,1]]\n```\nThe result should be `[1,1,1,1]`\n\nFor:\n```\ntable=\n[[3,7,4],\n[5,16,11],\n[2,9,7]]\n```\nThe result should be `[3,4,2,7]`\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` 2D integer array `table`, `3×3` table.\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer array\n",
