  "description": "Given a positive integer `n`, return first n dgits of Thue-Morse sequence, as a string (see examples).\n\nThue-Morse sequence is a binary sequence with 0 as the first element. The rest of the sequence is obtained by adding the boolean (binary) complement of a group obtained so far.\n\n```\nFor example:\n\n0\n01\n0110\n01101001\nand so on...\n```\n\n![alt](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Morse-Thue_sequence.gif)\n\n\nEx.:\n```\n 1 --> \"0\"\n 2 --> \"01\"\n 5 --> \"01101\"\n10 --> \"0110100110\"\n```\n\n- You don't need to test if n is valid - it will always be a positive integer.\n- `n` will be between 1 and 10000\n\n[Thue-Morse on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue%E2%80%93Morse_sequence)\n\n[Another kata on Thue-Morse](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-fun-number-106-is-thue-morse) by @myjinxin2015\n\n",
