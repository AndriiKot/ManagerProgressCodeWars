  "description": "A forest fire has been spotted at `fire`, a simple 2-element array with x, y coordinates.\n\nThe forest service has decided to send smoke jumpers in by plane and drop them in the forest.\n\nThe terrain is dangerous and surveyors have determined that there are three possible safe `dropzones`, an array of three simple arrays with x, y coordinates. \n\nThe plane is en route and time is of the essence. Your mission is to return a simple `[x,y]` array with the coordinates of the dropzone closest to the fire. \n\nIf several dropzones are an equal distance away from the fire, then return the *first* closest dropzone in the given array. \n\nFor example, if you are given: fire = `[1,1]`, dropzones = `[[0,1],[1,0],[2,2]]`, the answer is `[0,1]`, because that is the first closest dropzone in the given array.",
