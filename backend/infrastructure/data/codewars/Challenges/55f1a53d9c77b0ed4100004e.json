  "description": "The number `1035` is the smallest integer that exhibits a non frequent property: one its multiples, `3105 = 1035 * 3`, has its same digits but in different order, in other words, `3105`, is one of the permutations of `1035`.\n\nThe number `125874` is the first integer that has this property when the multiplier is `2`, thus: `125874 * 2 = 251748`\n\nMake the function `search_perm_mult()`, that receives an upper bound, n_max and a factor k and will output the amount of pairs bellow n_max that are permuted when an integer of this range is multiplied by `k`. The pair will be counted if the multiple is less than `n_max`, too\n\nLet'see some cases:\n```python\nsearch_perm_mult(10000, 7) === 1 # because we have the pair 1359, 9513\nsearch_perm_mult(5000, 7) === 0 # no pairs found, as 9513 > 5000\n\nsearch_perm_mult(10000, 4) === 2 # we have two pairs (1782, 7128) and (2178, 8712)\nsearch_perm_mult(8000, 4) === 1 # only the pair (1782, 7128) \n\nsearch_perm_mult(5000, 3) === 1 # only the pair (1035, 3105)\nsearch_perm_mult(10000, 3) === 2 # found pairs (1035, 3105) and (2475, 7425)\n```\nFeatures of the random Tests:\n```\n10000 <= n_max <= 100000\n3 <= k <= 7\n```\nEnjoy it and happy coding!!\n",
