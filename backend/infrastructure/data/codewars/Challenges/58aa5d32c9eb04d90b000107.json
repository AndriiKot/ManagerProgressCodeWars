  "description": "## Task\n\nCompute the [Mobius function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_function) `$\\mu (n)$` for a given value of `n`. \n\nFor a given `n`, the Mobius function is equal to:\n \n\n- `0` if `n` is divisible by the square of any prime number. For example `n` = `4, 8, 9` are all divisible by the square of at least one prime number.\n\n- `1` if `n` is **not** divisible by the square of any prime numbers, **and** has an **even number of prime factors**. For example `n` = `6, 10, 21` satisfy these conditions (e.g. `21 = 3 * 7` so it has an even number (2) of distinct prime factors and is not divisible by the square of any prime numbers).\n\n        \n- `-1` otherwise. For example `n` = `3, 5, 7, 30`.\n\n\n## Input/Output\n\n\nYou will be given an integer `n`; you must return an integer - the Mobius function of `n`.\n\n**Performance requirements:**\n\n `2 <= n <= 1e12`\n",
