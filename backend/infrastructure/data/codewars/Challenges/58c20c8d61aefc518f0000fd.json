  "description": "# Task\n You are given a regular array `arr`. Let's call a `step` the difference between two adjacent elements. \n \n Your task is to sum the elements which belong to the sequence of consecutive elements of length `at least 3 (but as long as possible)`, such that the steps between the elements in this sequence are the same.\n\n Note that some elements belong to two sequences and have to be counted twice.\n\n# Example\n\n For `arr = [54, 70, 86, 1, -2, -5, 0, 5, 78, 145, 212, 15]`, the output should be `639`.\n```\nThere are 4 sequences of equal steps in the given array:\n{54, 70, 86} => step +16\n{1, -2, -5} => step -3\n{-5, 0, 5} => step +5\n{78, 145, 212} => step +67\nSo the answer is \n(54 + 70 + 86) + \n(1 - 2 - 5) + \n(-5 + 0 + 5) + \n(78 + 145 + 212) = 639.\nThe last element 15 was not be counted.\n```\n\n For `arr = [7, 2, 3, 2, -2, 400, 802]`, the output should be `1200`.\n ```\n There is only 1 sequence in arr:\n {-2, 400, 802} => step +402\n So the answer is: -2 + 400 + 802 = 1200\n ```\n \n For `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output should be `15`.\n \n Note that we should only count {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} as a whole, any other small subset such as {1, 2, 3},{2, 3, 4},{3, 4, 5} are belong to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n \n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` array.integer `arr`\n\n `3 ≤ arr.length ≤ 100`\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n \n The sum of sequences.",
