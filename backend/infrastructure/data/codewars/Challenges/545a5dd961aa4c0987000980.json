  "description": "[Method chaining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining) is a very interesting way to keep your program clean.\n\nAs a part of this Kata, you need to create functions such that one could evaluate the following expression:\n\n    (3).add(5).multiply(2)\n\nThe above expression evaluates to be *16*.\n\nYou need to implement the following methods:\n\n* add\n* subtract\n* multiply\n* divide\n* square\n\nAfter you're done, one could chain these five methods to create chains of almost any length.",
