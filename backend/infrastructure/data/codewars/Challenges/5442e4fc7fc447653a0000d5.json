  "description": "The goal of this Kata is to return the greatest distance of index positions between matching number values in an array or 0 if there are no matching values.  \n\nExample:\nIn an array with the values `[0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1]` the greatest index distance is between the matching '1' values at index 2 and 5.  Executing `greatestDistance`/`greatest_distance`/`GreatestDistance` with this array would return 3. (i.e. 5 - 2)  \n\nHere are some extra examples:\n```\n[0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1]            => 3 (1's at indices 2 and 5)\n[9, 7, 1, 2, 3, 7, 0, -1, -2] => 4 (7's at indices 1 and 5)\n[0, 7, 0, 2, 3, 7, 0, -1, -2] => 6 (0's at indices 0 and 6)\n[1, 2, 3, 4]                  => 0 (no repeated elements)\n```\n\nThis is based on a Kata I had completed only to realize I has misread the instructions.  I enjoyed solving the problem I thought it was asking me to complete so I thought I'd add a new Kata for others to enjoy.  There are no tricks in this one, good luck!",
