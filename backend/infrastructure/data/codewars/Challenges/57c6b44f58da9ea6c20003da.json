  "description": "# Introduction\n\nTake a list of `n` numbers `a1, a2, a3, ..., aN` to start with.\n\n**Arithmetic mean** (or average) is the sum of these numbers divided by `n`.\n\n**Geometric mean** (or average) is the product of these numbers taken to the `n`th root.\n\n### Example\n\nList of numbers: `1, 3, 9, 27, 81`\n\n- `n = 5`\n- Arithmetic mean = `(1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81) / 5 = 121 / 5 = 24.2`\n- Geometric mean = `(1 * 3 * 9 * 27 * 81) ^ (1/5) = 59049 ^ (1/5) = 9`\n\n# Task\nYou will be given a list of numbers and their arithmetic mean. **However, the list is missing one number.** Using this information, you must figure out and return the geometric mean of the FULL LIST, including the number that's missing.",
