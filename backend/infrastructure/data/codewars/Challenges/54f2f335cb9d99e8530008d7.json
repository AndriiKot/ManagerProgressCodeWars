  "description": "The span function is a good one to know. It accepts a sequence and a predicate function and returns two sequences. The first sequence contains all the elements of the argument sequence up to the item that caused the first failure of the predicate. The second returned sequence contains the rest of the original sequence. The original sequence is not modified.\n\nFor example,\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction isEven (x) {\n  return Math.abs(x) % 2 === 0;\n}\n\nvar arr = [2,4,6,1,8,10];\n\n// This is true\nspan(arr, isEven) === [[2,4,6],[1,8,10]]\n```\n```ocaml\nlet is_even n = n mod 2 = 0 in\nspan [2; 4; 6; 8; 1; 2; 5; 4; 3; 2] is_even\n  (* -> ( [2; 4; 6; 8], [1; 2; 5; 4; 3; 2] ) *)\n```\n\nYour task is to...wait for it... write your own span function !!!\n\nHint/Challenge: If you have completed [the takeWhile function](http://www.codewars.com/kata/the-takewhile-function) and [the dropWhile function](http://www.codewars.com/kata/the-dropwhile-function), then you can solve this problem in one line!",
