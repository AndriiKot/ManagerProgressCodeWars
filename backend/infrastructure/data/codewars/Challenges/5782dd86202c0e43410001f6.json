  "description": "Your task is to write a function that receives as its single argument a string that contains numbers delimited by single spaces. Each number has a single alphabet letter somewhere within it.\n```\nExample : \"24z6 1x23 y369 89a 900b\"\n```\nAs shown above, this alphabet letter can appear anywhere within the number. You have to extract the letters and sort the numbers according to their corresponding letters. \n```\nExample : \"24z6 1x23 y369 89a 900b\" will become 89 900 123 369 246 (ordered according to the alphabet letter)\n```\nHere comes the difficult part, now you have to do a series of computations on the numbers you have extracted.\n\n* The sequence of computations are `+ - * /`. Basic math rules do **NOT** apply, you have to do each computation in exactly this order.\n* This has to work for any size of numbers sent in (after division, go back to addition, etc).\n* In the case of duplicate alphabet letters, you have to arrange them according to the number that appeared first in the input string.\n* Remember to also round the final answer to the nearest integer.\n\n```\nExamples :\n\"24z6 1x23 y369 89a 900b\" = 89 + 900 - 123 * 369 / 246 = 1299\n\"24z6 1z23 y369 89z 900b\" = 900 + 369 - 246 * 123 / 89 = 1414\n\"10a 90x 14b 78u 45a 7b 34y\" = 10 + 45 - 14 * 7 / 78 + 90 - 34 = 60\n``` \nGood luck and may the CODE be with you!\n",
