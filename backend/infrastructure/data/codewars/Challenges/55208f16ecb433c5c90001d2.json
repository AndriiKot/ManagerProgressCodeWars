  "description": "Calculate the trace of a square matrix. A square matrix has `n` rows and `n` columns, where `n` is any integer > 0. The entries of the matrix can contain any number of integers. The function should return the calculated trace of the matrix, or `nil/None` if the array is empty or not square; you can otherwise assume the input will be valid (of the form described below).\n\nThe trace of an n-by-n square matrix **A** is defined to be the sum of the elements on the main diagonal (the diagonal from the upper left to the lower right) of **A**.\n\nA matrix will be defined as an array of arrays, where the 1st entry represents the 1st row, the 2nd entry the 2nd row, and so on.\n\nFor example, the following code...\n```ruby,python\n[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n```\nrepresents the matrix\n```\n|1 2 3|\n|4 5 6|\n|7 8 9|\n```\nwhich has a trace of `1 + 5 + 9 = 15`.\n\nYou can read more about the trace of a matrix at these sources:\n\n * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra)\n * http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MatrixTrace.html\n\n~~~if:ruby\nNote: The `Matrix` class is disabled.\n~~~\n~~~if:python\nNote: `Numpy` is disabled.\n~~~",
