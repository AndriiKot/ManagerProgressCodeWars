  "description": "In **Block Dude**, the main character can climb boxes, but only if they are stacked in a particular way so that he is able to climb them one at a time. More specifically, he can only climb UP or DOWN one box at a time.\n\nLet `1` represent the boxes, and `0` represent the background. Write a function that returns `True` if block dude can travel from the left side to the right side of the screen given his constraints and `False` otherwise.\n\n```python\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, X, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, X, 1, X, X, 0, 0],\n  [0, X, X, 1, 1, 1, 1, X, 0],\n  [X, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, X]\n] ➞ True\n# Since block dude can travel across these boxes \n# Note: X's are just to show walking path and are not part of the actual input.\n\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, X, X, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n  [X, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n] ➞ False\n# stuck at column 3, being unable to climb 2 boxes at once.\n\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, X, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, X, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, X, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n  [X, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n] ➞ False\n# Block dude can't jump down 2 blocks.\n\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, X, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, X, 1, X, 0, X, 0, 0],\n  [X, X, 1, 1, 1, X, 1, X, 0],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, X]\n] ➞ True\n# First column can have a starting box\n\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n] ➞ False\n# Block dude cannot climb first column if it has more than one boxes\n\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, X, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, X, 1, X, 0, X, 0, X],\n  [X, X, 1, 1, 1, X, 1, X, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n]  ➞ True\n# Last column can have more than one boxes.\n\n\n[              X \n  [0, 0, 0, X, 1, X, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, X, 1, 1, 1, X, 0, X],\n  [X, X, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, X, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n]  ➞ True\n# Block dude can jump over a box on the top layer.\n```\n**Notes:**\n- First column can have a starting box\n- Block dude cannot climb first column if it has more than one boxes\n- Last column can have more than one boxes.\n- Block dude can jump over a box on the top layer.",
