  "description": "Work out what number day of the year it is.\n\n```\ntoDayOfYear([1, 1, 2000]) => 1\n```\nThe argument passed into the function is an array with the format `[D, M, YYYY]`, e.g. `[1, 2, 2000]` for February 1st, 2000 or `[22, 12, 1999]` for December 22nd, 1999.\n\nDon't forget to check for whether it's a [leap year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year)! Three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:\n- The year can be evenly divided by 4;\n- If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;\n- The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.\n",
