  "description": "## Task\n\nYou will be given a list of objects. Each object has `type`, `material`, and possibly `secondMaterial`. The existing materials are: `paper`, `glass`, `organic`, and `plastic`.\n\nYour job is to sort these objects across the 4 recycling bins according to their `material` (and `secondMaterial` if it's present), by listing the `type`'s of objects that should go into those bins.\n\n### Notes\n\n* The bins should come in the same order as the materials listed above\n* All bins should be listed in the output, even if some of them are empty\n* If an object is made of two materials, its `type` should be listed in both of the respective bins\n* The order of the `type`'s in each bin should be the same as the order of their respective objects was in the input list\n\n```if:python\n* Contrary to the example below, the output in Python should be a tuple of 4 lists instead of a 2-dimensional list\n```\n\n### Example\n\n```\ninput = [\n  {\"type\": \"rotten apples\", \"material\": \"organic\"},\n  {\"type\": \"out of date yogurt\", \"material\": \"organic\", \"secondMaterial\": \"plastic\"},\n  {\"type\": \"wine bottle\", \"material\": \"glass\", \"secondMaterial\": \"paper\"},\n  {\"type\": \"amazon box\", \"material\": \"paper\"},\n  {\"type\": \"beer bottle\", \"material\": \"glass\", \"secondMaterial\": \"paper\"}\n]\n\noutput = [\n  [\"wine bottle\", \"amazon box\", \"beer bottle\"],\n  [\"wine bottle\", \"beer bottle\"],\n  [\"rotten apples\", \"out of date yogurt\"],\n  [\"out of date yogurt\"]\n]\n```",
