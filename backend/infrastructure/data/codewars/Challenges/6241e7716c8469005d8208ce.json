  "description": "In lambda calculus, the only primitive are lambdas. No booleans, no strings, and of course no numbers. Everything is reduced to anonymous functions.\n\nChurch numbers are defined thusly:\n\n```lambdacalc\n0 = \\ f x . x\n1 = \\ f x . f x\n2 = \\ f x . f (f x)\n3 = \\ f x . f (f (f x))\nand so on ..\n```\n\nYour task will be to implement basic operators on numbers ( using only lambdas and function application ) : `add`, `mul`, and `sub`.\n\n## <span style=\"color:magenta\">However!</span>\n\nYour combinators will <span style=\"color:magenta\">not</span> be applied in <span style=\"color:magenta\">prefix</span> position, but in <span style=\"color:magenta\">infix</span> position instead.  \nTo make this at all possible, they will consist of single letters, like this:\n\n```lambdacalc\n2  a d d  3 -> 5\n2  m u l  3 -> 6\n2  s u b  3 -> 0  # subtractions that would normally result in negative values should return 0\n3  s u b  2 -> 1\n```\n\nActual testing will be extensional; the resulting function should behave correctly as a Church number, but need not be built strictly to the above definition.  \nYes, you can only define <span style=\"color:magenta\">one</span> `u`.\n\n## <span style=\"color:green\">For Bonus Points and Bragging Rights</span>\n\n`pow` is missing!\n\nIf you can make `pow` work, please publish a fork with the additional testing and earn Eternal Bragging Rights ( or at least until Christmas ). Both `0^0 = 1` and `0^0 = 0` are acceptable.",
