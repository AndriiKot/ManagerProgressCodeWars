  "description": "You work for a company that analyzes traffic count at a particular intersection during the peak hours of 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM. Each day, you are given a list that contains the number of vehicles that pass through the intersection every 10 minutes from 4:00 to 8:00 PM.\n\nYou are expected to return a list of tuples that each contain the hour and the maximum amount of traffic for each hour.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\na1 = [23,24,34,45,43,23,57,34,65,12,19,45, 54,65,54,43,89,48,42,55,22,69,23,93]\n\ntraffic_count(a1) ==> [('4:00pm', 45), ('5:00pm', 65), ('6:00pm', 89), ('7:00pm', 93)]\n```\n\nAll values in the given list are integers.",
