  "description": "An array is called *zero-balanced* if its elements sum to `0` and each element has its corresponding negative (i.e. if there are `x` elements `n`, then there must be `x` negatives `-n`). For example,\n\n```\n[1, -1, 2, -2] — zero-balanced, sum of elements is 0 + each element has its own negative;\n[0, 1, -1] — zero-balanced, 0 is the negative of itself (0 == -0);\n\n[3] — not zero-balanced; sum != 0;\n[3, -2, -1] — not zero-balanced, sum == 0, but the array has 3 but not its negative, -3;\n[1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 3, -3, -3] — despite having sum == 0 and all elements having their negatives, the latters must have the same amount as their originals, which doesn't comply here (four '1' and one '-1'), therefore, this array is not zero-balanced.\n```\n\nWrite a function that returns `true` if its argument is *zero-balanced* array, else return `false`. \n\n**Note**: an empty array will not sum to 0 since there are no elements in it, therefore, it should be treated as not zero-balanced.",
