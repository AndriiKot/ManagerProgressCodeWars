  "description": "# Task\n\nYou have set an alarm for some of the weekdays.\n\nDays of the week are encoded in binary representation like this:\n\n```\n0000001 - Sunday\n0000010 - Monday\n0000100 - Tuesday\n0001000 - Wednesday\n0010000 - Thursday\n0100000 - Friday \n1000000 - Saturday\n```\n\nFor example, if your alarm is set only for Sunday and Friday, the representation will be `0100001`. \n\nGiven the current day of the week, your task is to find the day of the week when the alarm will ring next time.\n\n---\n\n# Input/Output\n\n- `[input]` integer `Current Day`\n\nThe weekdays range from 1 to 7, 1 is Sunday and 7 is Saturday.\n\n\n- `[input]` integer `Available Weekdays`\n\nAn integer between 1 and 127, inclusive (which means the alarm will ring at least once per week). Days of the week are encoded in its binary representation.\n\n\n- `[output]` an integer\n\nThe next day available. The weekday format is same as `Current Day`.\n\n---\n\n\n# Example\n\nFor `Current Day = 4, Available Weekdays = 42`, the result should be `6`.\n \n```\nCurrent Day = 4 means current day is Wednesday\nAvailable Weekdays = 42, convert to binary is \"0101010\"\nSo the next day the alarm will ring is Friday (6)\n```",
