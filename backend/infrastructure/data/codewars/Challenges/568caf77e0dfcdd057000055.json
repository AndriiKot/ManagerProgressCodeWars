  "description": "# Array Graphics - Lines\nImplement a `draw` function for a two-dimensional array.\n\nA `canvas` (two-dimensional array [y][x] populated with zeros) will be supplied to the function as well as an array of `lines` to be drawn.\n\nEach line will be an object with a `from` point [x,y], a `to` point [x,y], and a `brush` character.\n\nNo points will be specified outside of the bounds of the array.  The `from` and `to` will never be the same point.\n\n#Note\nA simple `render` function has been preloaded for you.  It receives a canvas as an argument and returns a string representation.\n\n# Example\nIn this example, the `canvas` supplied is a 5x5 array.\n\nThe `lines` are specied as:\n```javascript\n[\n  { from: [1,0], to: [1,4], brush: 1 },\n  { from: [0,1], to: [4,1], brush: 2 }\n]\n```\n\nThe expected output would be:\n```javascript\n[\n  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```",
