  "description": "Return the magnitude of a vector, given as an array of its component values.\n\nThe vector (2, 3, 5) would be represented as an array containing three values at indices 0, 1 and 2 respectively.<br>\nThe array will always contain at least 2 and at most 100 elements (2 ≤ vector.Length ≤ 100), each of which will be within the range [-100, 100].\n<br>\nAn array containing four elements represents a vector in 4D space.\n\nMore info on finding the length of a vector: http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/301/lectures/node28.html",
