  "description": "Background\n----------\nIn another dimension, there exist two immortal brothers: Solomon and Goromon. As sworn loyal subjects to the time elemental, Chronixus, both Solomon and Goromon were granted the power to create temporal folds. By sliding through these temporal folds, one can gain entry to parallel dimensions where time moves relatively faster or slower.\n\nGoromon grew dissatisfied and one day betrayed Chronixus by stealing the Temporal Crystal, an artifact used to maintain the time continuum. Chronixus summoned Solomon and gave him the task of tracking down Goromon and retrieving the Temporal Crystal.\n\nUsing a map given to Solomon by Chronixus, you must find Goromon's precise location.\n\nMission Details\n---------------\nThe map is represented as a 2D array. See the example below:\n\n```javascript\nlet mapExample = [[1,3,5],[2,0,10],[-3,1,4],[4,2,4],[1,1,5],[-3,0,12],[2,1,12],[-2,2,6]];\n```\n```haskell\nmapExample = [(1,3,5),(2,0,10),(-3,1,4),(4,2,4),(1,1,5),(-3,0,12),(2,1,12),(-2,2,6)]\n```\n```go\nmapExample := [][3]int{{1,3,5},{2,0,10},{-3,1,4},{4,2,4},{1,1,5},{-3,0,12},{2,1,12},{-2,2,6}}\n```\n```python\nmap_example = [[1,3,5],[2,0,10],[-3,1,4],[4,2,4],[1,1,5],[-3,0,12],[2,1,12],[-2,2,6]]\n```\n```elixir\nmap_example = [{1,3,5},{2,0,10},{-3,1,4},{4,2,4},{1,1,5},{-3,0,12},{2,1,12},{-2,2,6}]\n```\n```csharp\nvar map_example = new int[][]{new[]{1,3,5},new[]{2,0,10},new[]{-3,1,4},new[]{4,2,4},new[]{1,1,5},new[]{-3,0,12},new[]{2,1,12},new[]{-2,2,6}};\n```\n```c\nint map_example[8][3] = {{1,3,5},{2,0,10},{-3,1,4},{4,2,4},{1,1,5},{-3,0,12},{2,1,12},{-2,2,6}};\n```\n```kotlin\n// In Kotlin, the input is of type Array<Triple<Int,Int,Int>>\nval mapExample = arrayOf(Triple(1,3,5),Triple(2,0,10),Triple(-3,1,4),Triple(4,2,4),Triple(1,1,5),Triple(-3,0,12),Triple(2,1,12),Triple(-2,2,6))\n```\n```rust\n// In Rust, the input is of type Vec<(i32, i32, i32)>\nlet map_example = vec![(1,3,5),(2,0,10),(-3,1,4),(4,2,4),(1,1,5),(-3,0,12),(2,1,12),(-2,2,6)];\n```\n```julia\nmapexample = [1 3 5; 2 0 10; -3 1 4; 4 2 4; 1 1 5; -3 0 12; 2 1 12; -2 2 6]\n```\n\nHere are what the values of each subarray represent:\n- **Time Dilation:** With each additional layer of time dilation entered, time slows by a factor of `2`. At layer `0`, time passes normally. At layer `1`, time passes at half the rate of layer `0`. At layer `2`, time passes at half the rate of layer `1`, and therefore one quarter the rate of layer `0`.\n- **Directions** are as follow: `0 = North, 1 = East, 2 = South, 3 = West`\n- **Distance Traveled:** This represents the distance traveled relative to the current time dilation layer. See below:\n\n```\nThe following are equivalent distances (all equal a Standard Distance of 100):\nLayer: 0, Distance: 100\nLayer: 1, Distance: 50\nLayer: 2, Distance: 25\n```\nFor the `mapExample` above:\n```\nmapExample[0] -> [1,3,5]\n1 represents the level shift of time dilation\n3 represents the direction\n5 represents the distance traveled relative to the current time dilation layer\n\nSolomon's new location becomes [-10,0]\n\nmapExample[1] -> [2,0,10]\nAt this point, Solomon has shifted 2 layers deeper.\nHe is now at time dilation layer 3.\nSolomon moves North a Standard Distance of 80.\nSolomon's new location becomes [-10,80]\n\nmapExample[2] -> [-3,1,4]\nAt this point, Solomon has shifted out 3 layers.\nHe is now at time dilation layer 0.\nSolomon moves East a Standard Distance of 4.\nSolomon's new location becomes [-6,80]\n```\nYour function should return Goromon's `[x,y]` coordinates.\n\nFor `mapExample`, the correct output is `[346,40]`.\n\nAdditional Technical Details\n----------------------------\n- Inputs are always valid.\n- Solomon begins his quest at time dilation level `0`, at `[x,y]` coordinates `[0,0]`.\n- Time dilation level at any point will always be `0` or greater.\n- Standard Distance is the distance at time dilation level `0`.\n- For given distance `d` for each value in the array: `d >= 0`.\n- Do not mutate the input\n\n**Note from the author:** I made up this story for the purpose of this kata.
