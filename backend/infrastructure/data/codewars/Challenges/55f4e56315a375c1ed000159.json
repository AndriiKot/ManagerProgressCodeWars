  "description": "The number 81 has a special property, a certain power of the sum of its digits is equal to 81 (nine squared). Eighty one (81), is the first number in having this property (not considering numbers of one digit). \nThe next one, is 512.\nLet's see both cases with the details\n\n8 + 1 = 9 and 9<sup>2</sup> = 81\n\n512 = 5 + 1 + 2 = 8 and 8<sup>3</sup> = 512\n\nWe need to make a function that receives a number as argument `n` and returns the `n-th term` of this sequence of numbers.\n\n### Examples (input --> output)\n\n```\n1 --> 81\n\n2 --> 512\n```\n\nHappy coding!\n",
