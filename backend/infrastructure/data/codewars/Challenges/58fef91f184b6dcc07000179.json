  "description": "Given a certain square matrix ```A```, of dimension ```n x n```, that has negative and positive values (many of them may be 0).\n\nWe need the following values rounded to the closest integer:\n\n- the average of all the positive numbers and zeros that are in the principal diagonal and in the columns with odd index, **avg1**\n\n- the absolute value of the average of all the negative numbers in the secondary diagonal and in the columns with even index, **avg2**\n\nLet's see the requirements in an example:\n```\nA = [[ 1,   3, -4,   5, -2,  5,  1], \n    [  2,   0, -7,   6,  8,  8, 15],\n    [  4,   4, -2, -10,  7, -1,  7],\n    [ -1,   3,  1,   0, 11,  4, 21],\n    [ -7,   6, -4,  10,  5,  7,  6],\n    [ -5,   4,  3,  -5,  7,  8, 17],\n    [-11,   3,  4,  -8,  6, 16,  4]]\n```    \nThe elements of the principal diagonal are: \n```\n[1, 0, -2, 0, 5, 8, 4]\n```\nThe ones that are also in the \"odd columns\" (we consider the index starting with 0) are: \n```\n[0, 0, 8] all positives\n```\nSo,\n```\navg1 =  [8 / 3] = 3\n```\nThe elements of the secondary diagonal are:\n```\n[-11, 4, -4, 0, 7, 8, 1]\n```\nThe ones that are in the even columns are:\n```\n[-11, -4, 7, 1]\n```\nThe negative ones are:\n```\n[-11, -4]\n```\nSo,\n```\navg2 = [|-15 / 2|] = 8\n```\nCreate a function that may receive a square matrix of uncertain dimensions and may output both averages in an array in the following order: ```[avg1, avg2]```\n\nIf one of the diagonals have no elements fulfilling the requirements described above the function should return ```-1```\nSo, if the function processes the matrix given above, it should output:\n```\n[3, 8]\n```\nFeatures of the random tests:\n```\nnumber of tests = 110\n5 ≤ matrix_length ≤ 1000\n-1000000 ≤ matrix[i, j] ≤ 1000000\n```\nEnjoy it!\nTranslations into another languages will be released soon.",
