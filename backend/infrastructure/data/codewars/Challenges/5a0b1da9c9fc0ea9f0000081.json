Your task is to find a unique anagram using the same letters - i.e. your result must be different to each word in the list.\n\nYour result can be _any_ valid answer, i.e. if there is more than one possible unused anagram, you may choose any of them to return.\n\nIf there is no valid answer, return an empty string.\n\n### Samples\n\n    INPUT  =>  OUTPUT\n    abcd, dbac, cbad  =>  dbca\n    12  =>  21\n    codewars, srawedoc  =>  edocraws\n    123, 132, 213, 231, 321, 312  =>  (empty string)",
