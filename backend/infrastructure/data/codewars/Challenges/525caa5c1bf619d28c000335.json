  "description": "If we were to set up a Tic-Tac-Toe game, we would want to know whether the board's current state is solved, wouldn't we? Our goal is to create a function that will check that for us!\n\nAssume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array, where the value is `0` if a spot is empty, `1` if it is an \"X\", or `2` if it is an \"O\", like so:\n\n```\n[[0, 0, 1],\n [0, 1, 2],\n [2, 1, 0]]\n```\n\nWe want our function to return:\n\n* `-1` if the board is not yet finished AND no one has won yet (there are empty spots),\n* `1` if \"X\" won,\n* `2` if \"O\" won,\n* `0` if it's a cat's game (i.e. a draw).\n\nYou may assume that the board passed in is valid in the context of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.",
