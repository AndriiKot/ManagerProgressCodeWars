  "description": "## Task\n\nLet's say we have a positive integer, `$n$`. You have to find the smallest possible positive integer that when multiplied by `$n$`, becomes a perfect power of integer `$k$`. A perfect power of `$k$` is any positive integer that can be represented as `$a^k$`. For example if `$k = 2$`, then `$36$` is a perfect power of `$k$`, but `$27$` isn't.\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\nn, k = 100, 3  return  10, #because 10*100 becomes 1000, and 1000 = 10**3\nn, k = 36, 2   return   1, #because 36 is already a perfect square 6**2\nn, k = 72, 4   return  18, #because 18*72 = 1296 = 6**4\n```\n```ruby\n[n, k] = [100, 3]  return  10, #because 10*100 becomes 1000, and 1000 = 10**3\n[n, k] = [36, 2]   return   1, #because 36 is already a perfect square 6**2\n[n, k] = [72, 4]   return  18, #because 18*72 = 1296 = 6**4\n```\n```haskell\n>>> mulPower 100 3\n10                  -- 100*10 == 1000 == 10^3\n>>> mulPower 36 2\n1                   -- 36*1 == 6^2\n>>> mulPower 72 4\n18                  -- 72*18 == 1296 == 6^4\n```\n\n**Notes:** \n+ `$k, n \\in \\mathbb{N} $` and `$ 1 \\lt n \\lt 10^6,\\text{ } 1 \\lt k \\lt 10 $`\n+ However, the output may be way larger than `$10^6$`.\n\nIf you have trouble seeing the numbers, refresh your page ;-) Please rate this kata.
