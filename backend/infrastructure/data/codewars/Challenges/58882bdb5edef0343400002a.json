  "description": "# Task\n Consider two following representations of a non-negative integer:\n\n A simple decimal integer, constructed of a non-empty sequence of digits from 0 to 9;\n \n An integer with at least one digit in a base from 2 to 16 (inclusive), enclosed between # characters, and preceded by the base, which can only be a number between 2 and 16 in the first representation. For digits from 10 to 15 characters a, b, ..., f and A, B, ..., F are used.\n \n Additionally, both representations may contain underscore (_) characters; they are used only as separators for improving legibility of numbers and can be ignored while processing a number.\n\n Your task is to determine whether the given string is a valid integer representation.\n\n Note: `this is how integer numbers are represented in the programming language Ada.`\n\n# Example\n\n For `line = \"123_456_789\"`, the output should be `true;`\n \n For `line = \"16#123abc#\"`, the output should be `true`;\n \n For `line = \"10#123abc#\"`, the output should be `false`;\n \n For `line = \"10#10#123ABC#\"`, the output should be `false`;\n \n For `line = \"10#0#\"`, the output should be `true`;\n \n For `line = \"10##\"`, the output should be `false`.\n \n# Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` string `line`\n\n  A non-empty string.\n\n - `[output]` a boolean value\n\n  `true` if line is a valid integer representation, `false` otherwise.",
