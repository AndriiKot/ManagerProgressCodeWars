  "description": "The palindromic number `595` is interesting because it can be written as the sum of consecutive squares: `6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2 = 595`.\n\nThere are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive square sums. Note that `1 = 0^2 + 1^2` has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.\n\nGiven an input `n`, find the count of all the numbers less than `n` that are both palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.\n\nFor instance: `values(1000) = 11`. See test examples for more cases.  \n\nGood luck!\n\nThis Kata is borrowed from [Project Euler #125](https://projecteuler.net/problem=125)\n\nIf you like this Kata, please try:\n\n[Fixed length palindromes](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59f0ee47a5e12962cb0000bf)\n\n[Divisor harmony](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59bf97cd4f98a8b1cd00007e)",
