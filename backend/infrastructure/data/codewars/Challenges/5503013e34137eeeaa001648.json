  "description": "Jamie is a programmer, and James' girlfriend. She likes diamonds, and wants a diamond string from James. Since James doesn't know how to make this happen, he needs your help.\n\n## Task\n\nYou need to return a string that looks like a diamond shape when printed on the screen, using asterisk (`*`) characters. Trailing spaces should be removed, and every line must be terminated with a newline character (`\\n`).\n\nReturn `null/nil/None/...` if the input is an even number or negative, as it is not possible to print a diamond of even or negative size.\n\n## Examples\n\nA size 3 diamond:\n\n\n```\n *\n***\n *\n```\n\n...which would appear as a string of `\" *\\n***\\n *\\n\"`\n\n\nA size 5 diamond:\n\n```\n  *\n ***\n*****\n ***\n  *\n```\n\n...that is: \n```\n\"  *\\n ***\\n*****\\n ***\\n  *\\n\"\n```\n",
