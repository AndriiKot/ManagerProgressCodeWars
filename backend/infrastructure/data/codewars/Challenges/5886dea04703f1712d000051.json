  "description": "# Task\n\nWe define the weakness of number `n` as the number of positive integers smaller than `n` that have more divisors than `n`. It follows that the weaker the number, the greater overall weakness it has.\n\nFor the given integer `n`, you need to answer two questions:\n\n* what is the weakness of the weakest numbers in the range `[1, n]`?\n* how many numbers in the range [1, n] have this weakness?\n\nReturn the answer as a tuple ( where applicable: array ) of two elements, where the first element is the answer to the first question, and the second element is the answer to the second question.\n\n# Example\n\nFor `n = 9`, the output should be `[2, 2]`\n\nHere are the number of divisors and the specific weaknesses of each number in range `[1, 9]`:\n\n```\n1: d(1) = 1, weakness(1) = 0;\n2: d(2) = 2, weakness(2) = 0;\n3: d(3) = 2, weakness(3) = 0;\n4: d(4) = 3, weakness(4) = 0;\n5: d(5) = 2, weakness(5) = 1;\n6: d(6) = 4, weakness(6) = 0;\n7: d(7) = 2, weakness(7) = 2;\n8: d(8) = 4, weakness(8) = 0;\n9: d(9) = 3, weakness(9) = 2.\n```\n\nAs you can see, the maximum weakness is `2`, and there are `2` numbers with that weakness.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` integer `n`  \n    Constraints: `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`\n - `[output]` a pair of integers ( see example tests what encoding is actually required )  \n    the weakness of the weakest number, and the number of integers in range `[1, n]` with this weakness",
