  "description": "<i>Special thanks to <b>SteffenVogel_79</b> for the idea</i>.\n\n```if:c\nChallenge:\n\nGiven a null-terminated string and a pre-allocated buffer that has enough memory to store the full null-terminated copy of the passed string, copy the entire string into the buffer with its vowels' case swapped, and return the pointer to the beginning of the copied string (buffer).\n```\n```if-not:c\nChallenge:\n\nGiven a string, return a copy of the string with the vowels' case swapped.\n```\n\nFor this kata, assume that vowels are in the set `\"aeouiAEOUI\"`.\n\n\n```if:c\nExample:\nGiven a string `\"C is alive!\"` and a buffer of size `strlen(\"C is alive!\") + 1`, after the call to swapCase(), the function should return the pointer to the buffer which now contains `\"C Is AlIvE!\"` and is properly null-terminated.\n```\n```if-not:c\nExample:\nGiven a string `\"C is alive!\"`, your function should return `\"C Is AlIvE!\"`\n```\n\nAddendum:\nYour solution is only required to work for the ASCII character set.\n\nPlease make sure you only swap cases for the vowels.\n\n```if:c\nYour solution should not allocate or de-allocate any memory. The buffer has already been pre-allocated before the call. Dont forget to NUL-terminate the output string.\n\nThe buffer has enough memory to hold the passed string and its null terminator entirely.\n```",
