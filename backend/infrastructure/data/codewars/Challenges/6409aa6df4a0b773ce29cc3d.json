  "description": "This is a rather simple but interesting kata. Try to solve it using logic. The shortest solution can be fit into one line.\n\n\n## Task\nThe point is that a natural number N (1 <= N <= 10^9) is given. You need to write a function which finds the number of natural numbers not exceeding N and not divided by any of the numbers [2, 3, 5].\n\n___\n### Example\nLet's take the number 5 as an example:\n1. 1 - doesn't divide integer by 2, 3, and 5\n2. 2 - divides integer by 2\n3. 3 - divides integer by 3\n4. 4 - divides integer by 2\n5. 5 - divides integer by 5\n\nAnswer: 1\n\nbecause only one number doesn't divide integer by any of 2, 3, 5\n___\n\n### Note\n\n_Again, try to think of a formula that will shorten your solution and help you pass big tests._\n\nGood luck :)\n\nIf you want to solve our problems, they are here:\n[From Singularity Hub Community](https://www.codewars.com/collections/from-singularity-hub-community)\n",
