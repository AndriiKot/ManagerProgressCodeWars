  "description": "[FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is often one of the first programming puzzles people learn. Now undo it with reverse FizzBuzz!\n\nWrite a function that accepts a string, which will always be a valid section of FizzBuzz. Your function must return an array that contains the numbers in order to generate the given section of FizzBuzz.\n\nNotes:\n- If the sequence can appear multiple times within FizzBuzz, return the numbers that generate the first instance of that sequence.\n- All numbers in the sequence will be greater than zero.\n- You will never receive an empty sequence.\n\n\n## Examples\n```javascript\n\"1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz\"        -->  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\"Fizz 688 689 FizzBuzz\"  -->  [687, 688, 689, 690]\n\"Fizz Buzz\"              -->  [9, 10]\n```",
