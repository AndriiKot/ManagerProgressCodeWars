  "description": "## Problem\n\nFor example:There are 60 students in a class. The teacher assigned two homework, 40 students finished the first homework, 31 students finished second homework, 4 students did not finish any homework. Please calculate: how many students have finished all the homework?\n\n## Task\n\nComplete function `howMany()` that accepts three arguments:\n\n`students`: Total number of students\n\n`finished`: An array. It's a list of the number of students who finish each homework. The array always contains 2 elements.\n\n`unfinish`: The number of students who did not finish any homework. \n\nThe result should be a number that is the number of students who have finished all the homework.\n\nIf it is not possible to get the correct result, please return `-1`\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nhowMany(60,[40,31],4) === 15\n\nVerify correctness:\nThe students who only finished homework1 == 40 - 15 = 25\nThe students who only finished homework2 == 31 - 15 = 16\nThe students who finished all homework   ==           15\nThe students who did not finish any homework ==        4\n25 + 16 + 15 + 4 = 60\n\nhowMany(60,[33,44],3) === 20\n\nVerify correctness:\nThe students who only finished homework1 == 33 - 20 = 13\nThe students who only finished homework2 == 44 - 20 = 24\nThe students who finished all homework   ==           20\nThe students who did not finish any homework ==        3\n13 + 24 + 20 + 3 = 60\n\nEdge case:\nhowMany(60,[40,20],0) === 0\n\nhowMany(60,[22,11],6) === -1\n\n```",
