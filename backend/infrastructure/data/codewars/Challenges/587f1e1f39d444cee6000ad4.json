  "description": "Create a `Vector` class with `x` and a `y` attributes that represent component magnitudes in the x and y directions.\n\nYour vectors should handle vector additon with an `.add()` method that takes a second vector as an argument and returns a new vector equal to the sum of the vector you call `.add()` on and the vector you pass in.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> a = Vector(3, 4)\n>>> a.x\n3\n>>> a.y\n4\n>>> b = Vector(1, 2)\n>>> c = a.add(b)\n>>> c.x\n4\n>>> c.y\n6\n```\n\nAdding vectors when you have their components is easy: just add the two x components together and the two y components together to get the x and y components for the vector sum.\n",
