  "description": "You are given an input (n) which represents the amount of lines you are given, your job is to figure out what is the **maximum** amount of perpendicular lines you can make using these lines.\n\n``Note: A perpendicular line is one that forms a 90 degree angle``\n```\nn will always be greater than or equal to 0\n```\nExamples with 3 and 4 lines\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BpssDwz.png)\n\n\n\n",
