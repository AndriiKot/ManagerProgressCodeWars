  "description": "In this kata you will be given an integer `n`, which is the number of times that a coin is thrown. You will have to return a sorted array of strings for all the possibilities ( heads is `'H'`, tails is `'T'` ).\n\n### Examples\n\n```\nn = 1 should return {\"H\", \"T\"}\nn = 2 should return {\"HH\", \"HT\", \"TH\", \"TT\"}\nn = 3 should return {\"HHH\", \"HHT\", \"HTH\", \"HTT\", \"THH\", \"THT\", \"TTH\", \"TTT\"}\n```\n\n``````if:c,cpp\nIn C and C++ just return a `char*` with all elements separated by `,` ( no space ):\n\n```\ncoin(2) should return \"HH,HT,TH,TT\"\n```\n``````\n\n### Input\n\n```0 < n < 18```\n\nCareful with performance!! You'll have to pass 3 basic test (n = 1, n = 2, n = 3), many medium tests (3 < n <= 10) and many large tests (10 < n < 18)",
