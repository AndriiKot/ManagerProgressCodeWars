  "description": "Write a function which takes one parameter representing the dimensions of a checkered board. The board will always be square, so 5 means you will need a 5x5 board.\n\nThe dark squares will be represented by a unicode white square, while the light squares will be represented by a unicode black square (the opposite colours ensure the board doesn't look reversed on code wars' dark background). It should return a string of the board with a space in between each square and taking into account new lines. \n\nAn even number should return a board that begins with a dark square. An odd number should return a board that begins with a light square.\n\n### Examples\n\n```text\nInput: 5\n\nOutput:\n■ □ ■ □ ■\n□ ■ □ ■ □\n■ □ ■ □ ■\n□ ■ □ ■ □\n■ □ ■ □ ■\n```\n\n**There should be no trailing white space at the end of each line, or new line characters at the end of the string.**\n\n### Note\n\nThe squares are characters `■` and `□` with codes `\\u25A0` and `\\u25A1`.  \nDo not use HTML entities for the squares (e.g. `□` for white square) as the code doesn't consider it a valid square. A good way to check is if your solution prints a correct checker board on your local terminal.  \n\n**Ruby note:**\nCodeWars has encoding issues with rendered unicode in Ruby.\nYou'll need to use unicode source code (e.g. \"\\u25A0\") instead of rendered unicode (e.g \"■\").",
