  "description": "The aspect ratio of an image describes the proportional relationship between its width and its height. Most video shown on the internet uses a 16:9 aspect ratio, which means that for every pixel in the Y, there are roughly 1.77 pixels in the X (where 1.77 ~= 16/9). As an example, 1080p video with an aspect ratio of 16:9 would have an X resolution of 1920, however 1080p video with an aspect ratio of 4:3 would have an X resolution of 1440.\n\nWrite a function that accepts arbitrary X and Y resolutions and converts them into resolutions with a 16:9 aspect ratio that maintain equal height. Round your answers up to the nearest integer.\n\nThis kata is part of a series with <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/aspect-ratio-cropping-part-2\">Aspect Ratio Cropping - Part 2</a> .\n\n<h1>Example</h1>\n<i>374 × 280 pixel image with a 4:3 aspect ratio.</i>\n\n<a title=\"By thewikipedian, uploaded by Andreas -horn- Hornig (Photo by thewikipedian.)
