  "description": "#### Task:\n\nYour job here is to implement a function `factors`, which takes a number `n`, and outputs an array of arrays comprised of two\nparts, `sq` and `cb`. The part `sq` will contain all the numbers that, when squared, yield a number which is a factor of `n`,\nwhile the `cb` part will contain all the numbers that, when cubed, yield a number which is a factor of `n`.  Discard all `1`s\nfrom both arrays.\n\nBoth `sq` and `cb` should be sorted in ascending order.\n\n#### What it looks like:\n\n```ruby\nfactors(Integer) #=> [\n  sq (all the numbers that can be squared to give a factor of n) : Array,\n  cb (all the numbers that can be cubed   to give a factor of n) : Array\n]\n```\n```crystal\nfactors(Int32) #=> [\n  sq (all the numbers that can be squared to give a factor of n) : Array(Int32),\n  cb (all the numbers that can be cubed   to give a factor of n) : Array(Int32)\n]\n```\n```python\nfactors(int) #=> [\n  sq (all the numbers that can be squared to give a factor of n) : list,\n  cb (all the numbers that can be cubed   to give a factor of n) : list\n]\n```\n```javascript\nfactors(Number) #=> [\n  sq (all the numbers that can be squared to give a factor of n) : Array,\n  cb (all the numbers that can be cubed   to give a factor of n) : Array\n]\n```\n```coffeescript\nfactors(Number) #=> [\n  sq (all the numbers that can be squared to give a factor of n) : Array,\n  cb (all the numbers that can be cubed   to give a factor of n) : Array\n]\n```\n\n#### Some examples:\n\n```ruby\nfactors(1) #=> [[], []]\n  # ones are discarded from outputs\n\nfactors(4) #=> [[2], []]\n  # 2 squared is 4;   4 is a factor of 4\n\nfactors(16) #=> [[2, 4], [2]]\n  # 2 squared is  4;  4 is a factor of 16\n  # 4 squared is 16; 16 is a factor of 16\n  # 2 cubed is    8;  8 is a factor of 16\n\nfactors(81) #=> [[3, 9], [3]]\n  # 3 squared is  9;  9 is a factor of 81\n  # 9 squared is 81; 81 is a factor of 81\n  # 3 cubed is   27; 27 is a factor of 81\n```\n\nAlso check out my other creations — [Keep the Order](https://www.codewars.com/kata/keep-the-order), [Naming Files](https://www.codewars.com/kata/naming-files), [Elections: Weighted Average](https://www.codewars.com/kata/elections-weighted-average), [Identify Case](https://www.codewars.com/kata/identify-case), [Split Without Loss](https://www.codewars.com/kata/split-without-loss), [Adding Fractions](https://www.codewars.com/kata/adding-fractions),\n[Random Integers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/random-integers), [Implement String#transpose](https://www.codewars.com/kata/implement-string-number-transpose), [Implement Array#transpose!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/implement-array-number-transpose), [Arrays and Procs #1](https://www.codewars.com/kata/arrays-and-procs-number-1), and [Arrays and Procs #2](https://www.codewars.com/kata/arrays-and-procs-number-2).\n\nIf you notice any issues or have any suggestions/comments whatsoever, please don't hesitate to mark an issue or just comment.
