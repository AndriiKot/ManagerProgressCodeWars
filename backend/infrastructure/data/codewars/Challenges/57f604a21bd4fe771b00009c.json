  "description": "Your job at E-Corp is both boring and difficult. It isn't made any easier by the fact that everyone constantly wants to have a meeting with you, and that the meeting rooms are always taken!\n\nIn this kata, you will be given an array. Each value represents a meeting room. Your job? Find the **first** empty one and return its index (N.B. There may be more than one empty room in some test cases). \n```\n'X' --> busy\n'O' --> empty\n```\n~~~if:cpp\nIf all rooms are busy, return `-1`\n~~~\n~~~if-not:cpp\nIf all rooms are busy, return `\"None available!\"`\n~~~\n\nMore in this series:\n\n<a href='https://www.codewars.com/kata/the-office-i-outed'>The Office I - Outed</a><br>\n<a href='https://www.codewars.com/kata/the-office-ii-boredom-score'>The Office II - Boredeom Score</a><br>\n<a href='https://www.codewars.com/kata/the-office-iii-broken-photocopier'>The Office III - Broken Photocopier</a><br>\n<a href='https://www.codewars.com/kata/the-office-v-find-a-chair'>The Office V - Find a Chair</a><br>\n",
