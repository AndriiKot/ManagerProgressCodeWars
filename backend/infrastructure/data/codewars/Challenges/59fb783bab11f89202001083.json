  "description": "You are having a BBQ, and after the BBQ you are left with some rubbish to recycle. \n\nThere are 3 recycling boxes: Red: Plastic, Green: Glass, Blue: Card.\n\nYou want to sort the rubbish according to the material and return the number of items in each box as an array (or a tuple in Python):\n\n```\n[plastic, glass, card]\n```\n\nThe material type can be determined based on the **sign** of the item's value:\n\n* **Plastic**: value > 0\n* **Glass**: value < 0\n* **Card**: value = 0\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nrubbish = [5, -9, 0, 6, -84, -95, 15]\n// Plastic = 3, Glass = 3, Card = 1\n// Output: [3, 3, 1]\n```",
