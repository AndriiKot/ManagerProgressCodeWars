  "description": "Your dad doesn't really *get* punctuation, and he's always putting extra commas in when he posts. You can tolerate the run-on sentences, as he does actually talk like that, but those extra commas have to go!\n\nWrite a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a string with the extraneous commas removed. The returned string should not end with a comma or have any trailing whitespace.",
