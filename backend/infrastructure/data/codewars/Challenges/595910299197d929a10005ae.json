  "description": "In an attempt to boost sales, the manager of the pizzeria you work at has devised a pizza rewards system: if you already made at least 5 orders of at least 20 dollars, you get a free 12 inch pizza with 3 toppings of your choice.\n\nHowever, the rewards system may change in the future. Your manager wants you to implement a function that, given a dictionary of customers, a minimum number of orders and a minimum order value, returns a <strong>set</strong> of the customers who are eligible for a reward.\n\nCustomers in the dictionary are represented as:\n```python\n{ 'customerName' : [list_of_order_values_as_integers] }\n```\n\nSee example test case for more details.",
