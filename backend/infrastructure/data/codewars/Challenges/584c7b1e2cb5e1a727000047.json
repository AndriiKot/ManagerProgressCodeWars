  "description": "## Task\nYou need to create a function, `helloWorld`, that will return the String `Hello, World!` without actually using raw strings. This includes quotes, double quotes and template strings. You can, however, use the `String` constructor and any related functions.\n\nYou cannot use the following:\n ```\n\"Hello, World!\"\n'Hello, World!'\n`Hello, World!`\n ```\n \n Good luck and try to be as creative as possible!\n",
