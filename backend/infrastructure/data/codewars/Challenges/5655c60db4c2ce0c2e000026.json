  "description": "Javascript functions can be combined to form new functions. For example the functions addOne and multTwo can be combined to form a new function which first adds one and then multiplies by two, as follows:\n\n```javascript\nconst addOne = (a) => a + 1\nconst multTwo = (b) => b * 2\nconst addOneMultTwo = (c) => multTwo(addOne(c))\n\naddOneMultTwo(5) // returns 12\n```\n\nCombining functions like this is called function composition. Functional programming libraries in Javascript such as Ramda include a generic compose function which does the heavy lifting of combining functions for you. So you could implement addOneMultTwo as follows:\n\n```javascript\nconst addOneMultTwo = compose(multTwo, addOne)\n\naddOneMultTwo(5) // returns 12\n```\nA simple implementation of compose, could work as follows:\n\n```javascript\nconst compose = (f, g) => (a) => f(g(a))\n```\n\nThe arguments f and g are unary functions (i.e. functions which take one argument). The problem with this compose function is that it only composes two functions. Your task is to write a compose function which can compose any number of functions together.\n",
