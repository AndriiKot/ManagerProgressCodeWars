  "description": "This kata is a very basic introduction to compression.\n\nYour task is to make a program which **takes in a sentence** and returns a string which shows the **unique position** of each word in the sentence. If a word appears more than once in the sentence, your string should\nreturn the position of the **first occurrence** of the word.\n\nUnique position in this case means the position of the word **excluding repeated words**.\nCapitalisation of words should be accounted for:\n'BEE' should be considered the same as 'bee'. The sentences include no punctuation.\n\n\nExample\n-----\n`\"man hello man\"`\n\nbecomes\n\n`\"010\"`\n\nExample\n-----\n\n`\"THE ONE BUMBLE BEE one bumble the bee\"`\n\nbecomes\n\n`\"01231203\"`\n\nExample\n-----\n\n`\"Ask not what your COUNTRY can do for you ASK WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR country\"`\n\nbecomes\n\n`\"01234567802856734\"`\n\n\n\n",
