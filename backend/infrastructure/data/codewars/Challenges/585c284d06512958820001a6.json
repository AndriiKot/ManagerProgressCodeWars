  "description": "Emily believes that her bosses may be spying on her communications at work.  This is not good because Emily is applying for new jobs and she doesn't want her bosses to know.  To try and deceive the eavesdropping company, she has devised an encoding scheme with the recruiter to encode all of their communication.\n\nThe encoding replaces all lower case letters in a string with the opposite letter in the alphabet.  In other words: a -> z, b -> y, c -> x, d -> w, etc.  All other characters remain the same.  The two parties have agreed on the encoding and they have generated encoded messages like:\n\n```\n\"I dlfow orpv gl rmgviervd lm Mlmwzb nlimrmt!\"\n```\n\nwhich decodes to:\n\n```\n\"I would like to interview on Monday morning!\"\n```\n\nYour job is to write a method called `decode` that takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string as output.\n",
