  "description": "Let's say we have a table called `sales_data` and it contains daily sales data. The table has two columns: `day` (an integer representing the day) and `sales` (an integer representing the sales amount for that day).\n\nSometimes, for whatever reason, sales data for a certain day might be missing (NULL). We want to fill in these missing values with the last recorded sales data.\n\nHere is a sample `sales_data` table:\n\n```\nday | sales\n----+------\n  1 | 100\n  2 | 150\n  3 | NULL\n  4 | NULL\n  5 | 200\n  6 | 120\n  7 | NULL\n  8 | NULL\n  9 | NULL\n```\n\nYour task is to write a SQL query that returns a result set with the same day values, but where the sales values have been replaced in such a way that each NULL value is replaced by the last non-NULL value (ordered by day). If the first sales values are NULL, they should remain NULL.\n\nThe result set for the sample `sales_data` table above should look like this:\n\n```\nday | filled_sales\n----+-------------\n  1 | 100\n  2 | 150\n  3 | 150\n  4 | 150\n  5 | 200\n  6 | 120\n  7 | 120\n  8 | 120\n  9 | 120\n  ```\n\nGLHF!\n\n",
