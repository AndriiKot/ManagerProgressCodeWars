  "description": "A comfortable word is a word which you can type always alternating the hand you type with (assuming you type using a QWERTY keyboard and use fingers as shown in the image below).\n\nThat being said, complete the function which receives a word and returns `true` if it's a comfortable word and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe word will always be a string consisting of only ascii letters from `a` to `z`.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1I7Uuc5.jpg)\n\nTo avoid problems with image availability, here's the lists of letters for each hand:\n\n* Left: `q, w, e, r, t, a, s, d, f, g, z, x, c, v, b`\n* Right: `y, u, i, o, p, h, j, k, l, n, m`\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n\"yams\"  -->  true\n\"test\"  -->  false\n```",
