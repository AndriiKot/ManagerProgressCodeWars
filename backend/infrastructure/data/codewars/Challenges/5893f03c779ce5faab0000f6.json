  "description": "# Task\nCodeBots decided to make a gift for CodeMaster's birthday. They got a pack of candies of various sizes from the store, but instead of giving the whole pack, they are trying to make the biggest possible candy from them. On each turn, it is possible:\n\n```\nto pick any two candies of the same size and merge\nthem into a candy which will be two times bigger;\n\nto pick a single candy of an even size and split it \ninto two equal candies half of this size each.\n```\nWhat is the size of the biggest candy they can make as a gift?\n\n# Example\n\nFor `arr = [2, 4, 8, 1, 1, 15]`, the output should be 16.\n```\n[2, 4, 8, 1, 1, 15] --> [2, 4, 8, 2, 15]\n-->[4, 4, 8, 15] --> [8, 8, 15] --> [16, 15] --> choose 16\n``` \n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - [input] integer array `arr`\n\n    Array of positive integers.\n\n    Constraints:\n    \n    `5 ≤ inputArray.length ≤ 50,`\n    \n    `1 ≤ inputArray[i] ≤ 100.`\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer",
