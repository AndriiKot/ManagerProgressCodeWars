  "description": "A cyclops number is a number in binary that is made up of all 1's, with one 0 in the exact middle.  That means all cyclops numbers must have an odd number of digits for there to be an exact middle.   \nA couple examples:  \n101  \n11111111011111111  \nYou must take an input, n, that will be in decimal format (base 10), then return True if that number wil be a cyclops number when converted to binary, or False if it won't.  \nAssume n will be a positive integer.  \n  \nA test cases with the process shown:\n```python\ncyclops (5)\n\"\"\"5 in biinary\"\"\"\n\"0b101\"\n\"\"\"because 101 is made up of all \"1\"s with a \"0\" in the middle, 101 is a cyclops number\"\"\"\nreturn True\n\ncyclops(13)\n\"\"\"13 in binary\"\"\"\n\"0b1101\"\n\"\"\"because 1101 has an even number of bits, it cannot be a cyclops\"\"\"\nreturn False\n\ncyclops(17)\n\"\"\"17 in binary\"\"\"\n\"0b10001\"\n\"\"\"Because 10001 has more than 1 \"0\" it cannot be a cyclops number\"\"\"\nreturn False\n```\n\n`n` will always be `> 0`.\n",
