  "description": "We know the formula to find the solutions of an equation of second degree with only one variable:\n\n`$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$`\n\n`$x = \\dfrac {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} } {2a}$`\n\n`$\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$`\n\n\nWe need a function that accepts three arguments, `a`, `b` and `c`, the coefficients of the above equation.\n\nThe outputs of the function may vary depending on the values of coefficients a, b and c, according to the following situations. (used values as examples only):\n\n```\n- If a is equal 0:\n  - If b and c are not 0. \n    Return: \"It is a first degree equation. Solution: 0.5512345\"\n\n  - If a, b and c are 0.\n    Return: \"The equation is indeterminate\"\n\n  - If a and b are 0, and c is not 0. \n    Return: \"Impossible situation. Wrong entries\"\n\n  - If a and c are 0 and b is not 0: \n    Return: \"It is a first degree equation. Solution: 0.0\"\n```\n\n```\n- If a is not 0:\n  - If Δ < 0 (see image above). \n    Return: \"There are no real solutions\"\n\n  - If Δ = 0. \n    Return: \"It has one double solution: 1.4142135624\"\n\n  - If Δ > 0. \n    Return: \"Two solutions: 1.7320508076, 2.0\"\n    (solutions should be sorted)\n```\n\nThe results should be expressed up to 10 decimals rounded result.\n\nLet's see some cases:\n\n```\na = 0, b = 2, c = -4\nShould return \"It is a first degree equation. Solution: 2.0\"\n\na = 10, b = 2, c = -4\nShould return \"Two solutions: -0.7403124237, 0.5403124237\"\n\na = 1.5, b = 2, c = 4\nShould return \"There are no real solutions\"\n\na = 1, b = -2, c = 1\nShould return \"It has one double solution: 1.0\"\n\na = 0, b = 0, c = 0\nShould return \"The equation is indeterminate\"\t\n\na = 0, b = 0, c = -2\nShould return \"Impossible situation. Wrong entries\"\n```\n\n(Be aware that the result has a string format and -0.0 is not 0.0)\n\n**Note on having two solutions:** input them sorted numerically; in the JavaScript version, not to put any extra difficulty on this one, sort them with a simple `.sort()` (which will sort them lexicographically).\n\nHappy coding!!",
