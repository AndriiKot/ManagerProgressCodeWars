  "description": "**Short Intro**\n\nSome of you might remember spending afternoons playing Street Fighter 2 in some Arcade back in the 90s or emulating it nowadays with the numerous emulators for retro consoles.\n\nCan you solve this kata? Suuure-You-Can!\n\nUPDATE: a new kata's harder version is available [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/street-fighter-2-character-selection-part-2/python).\n\n**The Kata**\n\nYou'll have to simulate the video game's character selection screen behaviour, more specifically the selection grid.\nSuch screen looks like this:\n\nScreen:\n\n![screen](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fightersgeneration.com%2Fnp5%2Fgm%2Fsf2ce-s2.jpg&f=1 \"Character Selection Screen for Street Fighter 2\")\n\nSelection Grid Layout in text:\n```\n| Ryu  | E.Honda | Blanka  | Guile   | Balrog | Vega    |\n| Ken  | Chun Li | Zangief | Dhalsim | Sagat  | M.Bison |\n```\n\n**Input**\n\n- the list of game characters in a 2x6 grid;\n- the initial position of the selection cursor (top-left is `(0,0)`);\n- a list of moves of the selection cursor (which are `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`);\n\n~~~if:rust\nThe `preloaded` module defines the following `enum`:\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub enum Direction {\n    Up,\n    Down,\n    Left,\n    Right,\n}\n```\n~~~\n\n**Output**\n\n- the list of characters who have been hovered by the selection cursor after all the moves (ordered and with repetition, all the ones after a move, whether successful or not, see tests);\n\n**Rules**\n\nSelection cursor is circular *horizontally* but *not vertically*!\n\nAs you might remember from the game, the selection cursor rotates horizontally but not vertically; that means that if I'm in the leftmost and I try to go left again I'll get to the rightmost (examples: from Ryu to Vega, from Ken to M.Bison) and vice versa from rightmost to leftmost.\n\nInstead, if I try to go further up from the upmost or further down from the downmost, I'll just stay where I am located (examples: you can't go lower than lowest row: Ken, Chun Li, Zangief, Dhalsim, Sagat and M.Bison in the above image; you can't go upper than highest row: Ryu, E.Honda, Blanka, Guile, Balrog and Vega in the above image).\n\n**Test**\n\nFor this easy version the fighters grid layout and the initial position will always be the same in all tests, only the list of moves change.\n\n**Notice**: changing some of the input data might not help you.\n\n**Examples**\n\n1.\n```\nfighters = [\n\t[\"Ryu\", \"E.Honda\", \"Blanka\", \"Guile\", \"Balrog\", \"Vega\"],\n\t[\"Ken\", \"Chun Li\", \"Zangief\", \"Dhalsim\", \"Sagat\", \"M.Bison\"]\n]\ninitial_position = (0,0)\nmoves = ['up', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'left']\n```\nthen I should get:\n```\n['Ryu', 'Vega', 'Ryu', 'Vega', 'Balrog']\n```\nas the characters I've been hovering with the selection cursor during my moves.\nNotice: Ryu is the first just because it \"fails\" the first `up`\nSee test cases for more examples.\n\n2.\n```\nfighters = [\n\t[\"Ryu\", \"E.Honda\", \"Blanka\", \"Guile\", \"Balrog\", \"Vega\"],\n\t[\"Ken\", \"Chun Li\", \"Zangief\", \"Dhalsim\", \"Sagat\", \"M.Bison\"]\n]\ninitial_position = (0,0)\nmoves = ['right', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right']\n```\nResult:\n```\n['E.Honda', 'Chun Li', 'Ken', 'M.Bison', 'Sagat', 'Dhalsim', 'Sagat']\n```\n\n**OFF-TOPIC**\n\nSome music to get in the mood for this kata :\n\n[Street Fighter 2 - selection theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR3d9FMBkC8)",
