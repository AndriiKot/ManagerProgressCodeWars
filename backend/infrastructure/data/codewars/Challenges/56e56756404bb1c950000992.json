  "description": "In this kata you need to create a function that takes a 2D array/list of non-negative integer pairs and returns the sum of all the \"saving\" that you can have getting the [LCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple) of each couple of number compared to their simple product.\n\nFor example, if you are given:\n```\n[[15,18], [4,5], [12,60]]\n```\nTheir product would be:\n```\n[270, 20, 720]\n```\nWhile their respective LCM would be:\n```\n[90, 20, 60]\n```\nThus the result should be:\n```\n(270-90)+(20-20)+(720-60)==840\n```\nThis is a kata that I made, among other things, to let some of my trainees familiarize with the [euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm), a really neat tool to have on your belt ;)",
