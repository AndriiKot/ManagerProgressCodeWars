  "description": "### Introduction\n\nAn IPv4 address is made up of 32 bits. The bits are divided into four sections called **octets** (groups of eight). Each octet can have a number in the range 0 to 255 (unsigned 8-bit integers).\n\nAll IPv4 addresses belong to an **Address Class**. There are five different address classes (A, B, C, D and E). It's the **first** (left most) octet that tells us which class the address belongs to.\n\n```\nClass:  Identifier:  Ranges:\n---------------------------------------\n A      0-------     00000000-01111111\n B      10------     10000000-10111111\n C      110-----     11000000-11011111\n D      1110----     11100000-11101111\n E      1111----     11110000-11111111\n```\nThe bits in the **Identifiers** column above is used to determine the class of an address. So, if an address starts with the bits that are visible in the identifier column, it belongs to the class in the **Class** column on the same row.\n\nIf we look at the address `192.168.0.1` as an example:\n* The first octet is `192`, which in binary is `11000000`.\n* The first 3 bits of this octet is set to `110` which means that it is a **Class C** address.\n\n### The Assignment\n\n~~~if:c\nYour task is to implement a function `char ipv4_address_class(const char *ipv4_addr)` which takes in an IPv4 address `ipv4_addr` and returns a character `char` (A, B, C, D, or E) representing the address class. \n~~~\n~~~if:python\nYour task is to implement a function `def ipv4_address_class(ipv4_addr` which takes in an IPv4 address string `ipv4_addr` and returns a single character string (`'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'`, `'D'`, or `'E'`) representing the address class. \n~~~\n~~~if:haskell\nYour task is to implement a function `ipv4AddressClass` which takes in an IPv4 address `String` and returns a `Char` (`'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'`, `'D'`, or `'E'`) representing the address class. \n~~~\n\n### Testing\n\nThe tests will challenge your function with addresses in the full 32-bit range (`0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255`) and ***nothing else***.\n\n### Links\nCheck out these links for more information:\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number\n",
