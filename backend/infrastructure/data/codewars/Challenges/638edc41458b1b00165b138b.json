  "description": "A Carmichael number is defined as a number N that is composite and yet passes Fermat primality test, i.e. `M**(N-1) == 1 (mod N)`, for all M relatively prime to N.\n\nFind a Carmichael number that satisfies the following:\n\n* It is a product of *seven* prime numbers.\n* Its prime factors are between `10**7` and `10**9`.\n\nSubmit the prime factorization of such a number.",
