  "description": "The [Strategy Design Pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOEsKHqLiBM) can be used, for example, to determine how a unit moves in the StarCraft game.\n\nThe pattern consists in having a different strategy to one functionality. A unit, for example, could move by walking or flying.\n\n## Your Task\n\nComplete the code so that when a `Viking` is flying its position increases by `10` each time it moves. If it is walking then the position is increased by `1`.\n\nIn this Kata, Viking starts as a ground unit when it is created.\n\nYou have `3` classes:\n\n  - `Viking`: has a `position`, `moveBehavior` and `move` method.\n  - `Fly` and `Walk`: the move behaviors with the `move(unit)` method. `Fly` has to move `10` positions at a time and `Walk` has to move `1`.\n\n## Resouces\n\n  - [PatternCraft > Strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOEsKHqLiBM)\n  - [SourceMaking > Strategy](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/strategy)\n  - [Wikipedia > Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern)\n\n# PatternCraft series\n\n  - [State Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-state/)\n  - **Strategy Pattern**\n  - [Visitor Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-visitor/)\n  - [Decorator Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-decorator/)\n  - [Adapter Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-adapter/)\n  - [Command Pattern](http://www.codewars.com/kata/patterncraft-command/)\n\nThe original [PatternCraft series (by John Lindquist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8B19C3040F6381A2) is a collection of Youtube videos that explains some of the design patterns and how they are used (or could be) on StarCraft.",
