  "description": ">This Kata series is transplanted from other sites ;-)\n\n# Mission\nYou have some tasks in your Asana account. For each ith of them you know its deadlinesi, which is the last day by which it should be completed. As you can see in your calendar, today is the day number day. Asana labels each task in accordance with its due date:\n\n If the task is due today or it's already overdue, it is labeled as Today;\n \n If the task should be completed within a week (but not today), i.e. its deadline is somewhere between `day + 1` and `day + 7` both inclusive, it is labeled as Upcoming;\n \n All other tasks are labeled as Later;\n \n Your goal is to find the number of tasks with each label and return it as an array of format `[Today, Upcoming, Later]`, where Today, Upcoming and Later is the number of tasks with the corresponding label.\n\n - Example\n\n   For `deadlines = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and day = 2`, the output should be  `[2, 3, 0]`.\n\n   Today is day 2, so tasks with deadlines at 1 and 2 are labeled as Today. Other three tasks should be completed within a week and should be labeled as Upcoming. There're no tasks labeled as Later.\n  \n  ![!](https://codefightsuserpics.s3.amazonaws.com/tasks/tasksTypes/img/example1.png?_tm=1474900318595)\n  \n  For `deadlines = [1, 2, 4, 2, 10, 3, 1, 4, 5, 4, 9, 8] and day = 1`, \n   \n  the output should be [2, 8, 2]\n\n  Today is day 1, which means that two tasks with deadlines 1 are labeled as Today. Tasks with deadlines 10 and 9 are labeled as Later, since their deadlines are more than 7 days ahead. The rest 8 tasks are labeled as Upcoming.\n\n  ![](https://codefightsuserpics.s3.amazonaws.com/tasks/tasksTypes/img/example2.png?_tm=1474900318759)\n\n# Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` integer array `deadlines`\n\n   Constraints: 1 ≤ deadlines.length ≤ 50, 1 ≤ deadlines[i] ≤ 18.\n\n - `[input]` integer `day`\n\n    Constraints: 1 ≤ day ≤ 18.\n\n - `[output]` an integer array\n\n  Array of three elements, the number of tasks labeled as Today, Upcoming and Later, respectively.",
