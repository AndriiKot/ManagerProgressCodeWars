  "description": "Your task is to calculate the maximum possible height of a perfectly square pyramid (the number of complete layers) that we can build, given `n` number of cubes as the argument.\n\n* The top layer is always only 1 cube and is always present.\n* There are no hollow areas, meaning each layer must be fully populated with cubes.\n* The layers are thus so built that the corner cube always covers the inner 25% of the corner cube below it and so each row has one more cube than the one below it.\n\nIf you were given only 5 cubes, the lower layer would have 4 cubes and the top 1 cube would sit right in the middle of them, where the lower 4 cubes meet.\n\nIf you were given 14 cubes, you could build a pyramid of 3 layers, but 13 wouldn't be enough as you would be missing one cube, so only 2 layers would be complete and some cubes left over!\n\nWhat is the tallest pyramid possible we can build from the given number of cubes? Simply return the number of **complete** layers.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```ruby\n 4  -->  1\n 5  -->  2\n13  -->  2\n14  -->  3\n```\n\n",
