  "description": "In mathematics, any of the positive integers that occurs as a coefficient in the binomial theorem is a binomial coefficient. [Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient).\n\nCommonly, a binomial coefficient is indexed by a pair of integers `n >= k >= 0` and is written (n 'over' k). This notation is read as \"from n choose k\".\n\nThe formula is described simply, [here](https://www.hackmath.net/en/calculator/n-choose-k).\n\nAn interesting fact about the binomial theorem is that the binomial coefficients can be arranged to form [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle). They can also be used to describe properties of N dimensional [hypercubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube). [Here's a cool video](https://youtu.be/KYaCtHPCARc) talking about that.\n\n## Challenge\n\nYour task is to augment the `Integer` class to give integers a `choose` method so that you may write `10.choose 4` and return the number of combinations. e.g. `10.choose(4) == 210`. You will find enough information to solve this challenge in the links above.",
