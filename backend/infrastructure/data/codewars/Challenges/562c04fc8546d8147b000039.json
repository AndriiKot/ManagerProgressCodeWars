  "description": "The numbers 12, 63 and 119 have something in common related with their divisors and their prime factors, let's see it.\n```\nNumbers PrimeFactorsSum(pfs)        DivisorsSum(ds)              Is ds divisible by pfs\n12         2 + 2 + 3 = 7         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 28            28 / 7 = 4,  Yes\n63         3 + 3 + 7 = 13        1 + 3 + 7 + 9 + 21 + 63 = 104         104 / 13 = 8, Yes\n119        7 + 17 = 24           1 + 7 + 17 + 119 = 144                144 / 24 = 6, Yes\n```\nThere is an obvius property you can see: the sum of the divisors of a number is divisible by the sum of its prime factors.\n\nWe need the function ```ds_multof_pfs()``` that receives two arguments: ```nMin``` and  ```nMax```, as a lower and upper limit (inclusives), respectively, and outputs a sorted list with the numbers that fulfill the property described above.\n\nWe represent the features of the described function:\n```python\nds_multof_pfs(nMin, nMax) -----> [n1, n2, ....., nl] # nMin ≤ n1 < n2 < ..< nl ≤ nMax\n```\nLet's see some cases:\n```python\nds_multof_pfs(10, 100) == [12, 15, 35, 42, 60, 63, 66, 68, 84, 90, 95]\n\nds_multof_pfs(20, 120) == [35, 42, 60, 63, 66, 68, 84, 90, 95, 110, 114, 119]\n```\nEnjoy it!!\n\n\n\n",
