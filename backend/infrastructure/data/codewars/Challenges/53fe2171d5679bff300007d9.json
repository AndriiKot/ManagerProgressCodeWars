  "description": "The factorial function is widely found in pure mathematics, most commonly in combinatorics and discrete probability. Typically the factorial is a function defined over nonnegative integers in such a way:\n\nFor `n=0`, `factorial(n) = 1`. For `n>0`, `factorial(n) = n*(n-1)*...*2*1`.\n\nFor example\n\n`factorial(2) = 2`\n\n`factorial(4) = 24`. \n\nIt might seem odd that `factorial(0) = 1`, but it is more of a convenience than anything else.\n\nThis problem requires you to define an extended version of the factorial function, one that accepts all integers! For nonnegative integers, your function should behave as above. \n\nFor `n<0`, `factorial(n) = (n)*(n+1)*...*(-2)*(-1)`.\n\nFor example\n\n`factorial(-1) = -1`\n\n`factorial(-2) = 2`\n\n`factorial(-3) = -6`\n\nGet to it! Also, note that you will only get integers as input. No need for error messages:)\n",
