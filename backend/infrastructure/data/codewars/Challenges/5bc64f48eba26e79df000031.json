  "description": "### Story\n\nIn the fictional country of Bugliem, you can ask for a custom licence plate on your car, provided that it meets the followoing criteria:\n* it's 2-8 characters long\n* it contains only letters `A-Z`, numbers `0-9`, and dashes `-`\n* letters and numbers are separated by a dash\n* it doesn't start or end with a dash, and it doesn't have consecutive dashes\n* it's not made up of numbers only\n\nYou also have to pay 1000 local units to obtain one, although this will not be tested.\n\n\n### Task\n\nTo make the life of the local authorities easier (and get your driving record cleaned), you need to implement a function that accepts an ascii input string, and returns the number plate if possible.\n\nYou have to replace all special characters and spaces with dashes (consecutive characters  should be replaced with a single dash), and truncate the result to maximum 8 characters (if longer). If the result complies with the above criteria, return it capitalized; otherwise return `\"not possible\"`.\n\n\n### Examples\n\n```\n\"mercedes\"    -->  \"MERCEDES\"\n\"anter69\"     -->  \"ANTER-69\"\n\"1st\"         -->  \"1-ST\"\n\"~c0d3w4rs~\"  -->  \"C-0-D-3\"\n\"I'm cool!\"   -->  \"I-M-COOL\"\n\"1337\"        -->  \"not possible\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### My other katas\n\nIf you enjoyed this kata then please try [my other katas](https://www.codewars.com/users/anter69/authored)! :-)\n\n#### *Translations are welcome!*",
