  "description": "# Union of closed disjoint intervals\n\nWrite a function `interval_insert` which takes as input\n\n- a list `myl` of disjoint closed intervals with integer endpoints, sorted by increasing order of left endpoints\n- an interval `interval`\n\nand returns the union of `interval` with the intervals in `myl`, as an array of disjoint closed intervals.\n\n___\n\n## Terminology\n\nA `closed` interval includes its endpoints. For example `[0,5]` means greater than or equal to `0` and less than or equal to `5`. For more, refer to [Wikipedia](http://bit.ly/disjointInterval).\n\nTwo intervals are said to be `disjoint` if they have no element in common. Equivalently, disjoint intervals are intervals whose intersection is the empty interval. For example,  \n`[1,3]` and `[4,6]` are disjoint  \n`[1,3]` and `[3,5]` are not.\n\n___\n\n## Examples:\n\n```c\n                         [(1, 2)], (3, 4) -> [(1, 2), (3, 4)]\n                         [(3, 4)], (1, 2) -> [(1, 2), (3, 4)]\n                 [(1, 2), (4, 6)], (1, 4) -> [(1, 6)]\n[(0, 2), (3, 6), (7, 7), (9, 12)], (1, 8) -> [(0, 8), (9, 12)]\n```",
