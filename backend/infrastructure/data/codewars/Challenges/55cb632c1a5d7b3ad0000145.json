  "description": "Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him.\n\nWrite a program where Alex can input (`n`) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message:\n- If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string `\"Great, now move on to tricks\"`.\n- If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string `\"Keep at it until you get it\"`. \n",
