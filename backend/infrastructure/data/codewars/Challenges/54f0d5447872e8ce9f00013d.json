  "description": "The factorial of a number, `n!`, is defined for whole numbers as the product of all integers from `1` to `n`. \n\nFor example, `5!` is `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`\n\nMost factorial implementations use a recursive function to determine the value of `factorial(n)`. However, this blows up the stack for large values of `n` - most systems cannot handle stack depths much greater than 2000 levels.\n\nWrite an implementation to calculate the factorial of arbitrarily large numbers, *without recursion.*\n\n# Rules\n\n* `n < 0` should return `nil`/  `None`\n* `n = 0` should return `1`\n* `n > 0` should return `n!`\n\n# Note\n\nCodewars limits the amount of data it will send back and forth, which may introduce a false ceiling for how high of a value of `n` it will accept. All tests use values less than this limit.",
