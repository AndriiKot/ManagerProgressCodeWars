  "description": "Grayscale colors in RGB color model are colors that have the same values for Red, Green and Blue. For example, `#606060` is a grayscale color, while `#FF0055` is not.\n\nIn order to correctly convert a color to grayscale, one has to use luminance Y for Red, Green and Blue components. One can calculate luminance Y through the formula introduced in the NTSC standard:\n```\nY = 0.299 * R + 0.587 * G + 0.114 * B\n```\nThis formula closely represents the average person's relative perception of the brightness of red, green, and blue light.\n\nGiven a color in 6-digit [hexidecimal notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors) `#RRGGBB` in upper case, convert it to grayscale `#YYYYYY`. The answer should be a string representing the color code in 6-digit hexidecimal notation in upper or lower case. \n\nRound the value of luminance Y to the closest integer. \n\nAll inputs will be valid.",
