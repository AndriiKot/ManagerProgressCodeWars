  "description": "Consider an array containing cats and dogs. Each dog can catch only one cat, but cannot catch a cat that is more than `n` elements away. Your task will be to return the maximum number of cats that can be caught.\n\nFor example:\n```Haskell\nsolve(['D','C','C','D','C'], 2) = 2, because the dog at index 0 (D0) catches C1 and D3 catches C4. \nsolve(['C','C','D','D','C','D'], 2) = 3, because D2 catches C0, D3 catches C1 and D5 catches C4.\nsolve(['C','C','D','D','C','D'], 1) = 2, because D2 catches C1, D3 catches C4. C0 cannot be caught because n == 1.\nsolve(['D','C','D','D','C'], 1) = 2, too many dogs, so all cats get caught!\n```\n\nDo not modify the input array. \n\nMore examples in the test cases. Good luck!",
