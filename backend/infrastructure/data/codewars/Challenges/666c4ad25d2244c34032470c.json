  "description": "I will pass you an array of numbers and a target. You need to answer me with a boolean if the sum of three values of the array is equals to the target.\n\nYou can't reuse the same value more than one time, like:\n- Input: [1,99,99]\n  Target: 3\n  Answer: false, because you can't sum the same value more than one time \n\nExamples:\n- Input: [0,-1,1,5,9]\n  Target: 0\n  Answer: true, because 0 + 1 + -1 = 0\n\n- Input: [1,2,3,4] \n  Target: 10\n  Answer: false, because you need to sum all 4 values (not 3)  to reach 6\n\n- Input: [-1,1,2,3]\n  Target: 7\n  Answer: false, beacuse you can't reach the target adding all combinations of the values in the input array, grouping by three values",
