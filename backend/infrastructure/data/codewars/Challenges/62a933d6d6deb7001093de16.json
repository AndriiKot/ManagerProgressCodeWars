  "description": "You are given a random string of lower-case letters. Your job is to find out how many ordered and consecutive vowels there are in the given string beginning from `a`. Keep in mind that the consecutive vowel to `u` is `a` and the cycle continues.\n\nReturn an integer with the length of the consecutive vowels found.\n\nThis is better explained with a couple of examples:\n\n1. You are given the string `\"agrtertyfikfmroyrntbvsukldkfa\"`. The logic is that you start from the `a` and make your way right. The next vowel is an `e` and it is the consecutive vowel, then `i` and so forth until you get to `u`. If you keep moving right you find `a` which happens to be the consecutive vowel. Return `6`.\n1. This is a slightly trickier example: you are given the string `\"erfaiekjudhyfimngukduo\"`. As you move right you ignore all vowels until you get to the `a`, then ignore the rest until you get to the `e`, which is the consecutive vowel, and so forth until you get to the `o`. Return `4`.\n\n### Note\n\nFor this kata, the vowels are `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`, in that order. `y` is not considered a vowel in this kata.\n\nGood luck!",
