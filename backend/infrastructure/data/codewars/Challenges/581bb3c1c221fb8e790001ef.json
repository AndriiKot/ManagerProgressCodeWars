  "description": "You will be given a certain array of length ```n```, such that ```n > 4```, having positive and negative integers but there will be no zeroes and all the elements will occur once in it.\n\nWe may obtain an amount of ```n``` sub-arrays of length ```n - 1```, removing one element at a time (from left to right). \n\nFor each subarray, let's calculate the product and sum of its elements with the corresponding absolute value of the quotient, ```q = SubProduct/SubSum``` (if it is possible, SubSum cannot be 0). \nThen we select the array with the lowest value of ```|q|```(absolute value)\n\ne.g.: we have the array, ```arr = [1, 23, 2, -8, 5]```\n```\nSub Arrays            SubSum    SubProduct         |q|\n[23, 2, -8, 5]         22         -1840         83.636363\n[1, 2, -8, 5]           0           -80          No value\n[1, 23, -8, 5]         21          -920         43.809524\n[1, 23, 2, 5]          31           230          7.419355  <--- selected array\n[1, 23, 2, -8]         18          -368         20.444444\n```\nLet's compare the given array with the selected subarray:\n```\n[1, 23, 2, -8, 5]\n[1, 23, 2,     5]\n```\nThe difference between them is at the index ```3``` for the given array, with element ```-8```, so we put both things for a result ```[3, -8]```.\n\nThat means that to obtain the selected subarray, we have to take out the value -8 at index 3.\nWe need a function that receives an array as an argument and outputs the pair ```[index, arr[index]]``` that generates the subarray with the lowest value of ```|q|```.\n\n```python \n[1, 23, 2, -8, 5] ---> [3, -8]\n```\nAnother case:\n```python \n[1, 3, 23, 4, 2, -8, 5, 18] ---> [2, 23]\n```\n\nWe may have some special arrays that may have more than one solution, like the one that follows below.\n```python \n[10, 20, -30, 100, 200] ---> [[3, 100], [4, 200]]\n```\nIf there is more than one result, the function should output a 2D array sorted by the index of the element removed from the array.\n\nThanks to Unnamed for detecting the special cases when we have multiple solutions.\n\nFeatures of the random tests:\n```\nNumber of tests = 200\nlength of the array, l, such that 20 <= l <= 100\n```\n\nEnjoy it!!\n",
