  "description": "A series or sequence of numbers is usually the product of a function and can either be infinite or finite.\n\nIn this kata we will only consider finite series and you are required to return a code according to the type of sequence:\n\n|Code|Type|Example|\n|-|-|-|\n|`0`|`unordered`|`[3,5,8,1,14,3]`|\n|`1`|`strictly increasing`|`[3,5,8,9,14,23]`|\n|`2`|`not decreasing`|`[3,5,8,8,14,14]`|\n|`3`|`strictly decreasing`|`[14,9,8,5,3,1]`|\n|`4`|`not increasing`|`[14,14,8,8,5,3]`|\n|`5`|`constant`|`[8,8,8,8,8,8]`|\n\n~~~if:rust\nFor Rust, the following enum is provided as result type:\n```rust if:rust\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Clone, Copy)]\npub enum Order {\n    Unordered,\n    Increasing,\n    NotDecreasing,\n    Decreasing,\n    NotIncreasing,\n    Constant,\n}\n\n```\n~~~\nYou can expect all the inputs to be non-empty and completely numerical arrays/lists - no need to validate the data; do not go for sloppy code, as rather large inputs might be tested.\n\nTry to achieve a good solution that runs in linear time; also, do it functionally, meaning you need to build a *pure* function or, in even poorer words, do NOT modify the initial input!",
