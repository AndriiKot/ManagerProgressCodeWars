  "description": "This is the **code golf** version of [this kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/6375587af84854823ccd0e90/) -- it's best to solve that one first.\n\nEverything is exactly the same here: the input, the task, the tests, and the expected output. The only difference is the code size limit: maximum **400 bytes**!\n\nOh, and there is no preloaded character map either... \n\n*Shortest solution to date: `284` bytes*\n\n---\n\n### My other katas\n\nIf you enjoyed this kata then please try [my other katas](https://www.codewars.com/users/anter69/authored)! :-)\n\n\n#### *Translations are welcome!*",
