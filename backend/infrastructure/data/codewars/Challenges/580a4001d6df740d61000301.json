  "description": "You are given an array of non-negative integers, your task is to complete the series from 0 to the highest number in the array.\n\nIf the numbers in the sequence provided are not in order you should order them, but if a value repeats, then you must return a sequence with only one item, and the value of that item must be 0. like this:\n```\ninputs        outputs\n[2,1]     ->  [0,1,2]\n[1,4,4,6] ->  [0]\n```\nNotes: all numbers are positive integers.\n\nThis is set of example outputs based on the input sequence.\n```\ninputs        outputs\n[0,1]   ->    [0,1]\n[1,4,6] ->    [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]\n[3,4,5] ->    [0,1,2,3,4,5]\n[0,1,0] ->    [0]\n```\n\n",
