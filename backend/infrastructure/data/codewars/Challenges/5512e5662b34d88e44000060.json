  "description": "You receive some random elements as a space-delimited string. Check if the elements are part of an ascending sequence of integers starting with 1, with an increment of 1 (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nReturn:\n\n* `0` if the elements can form such a sequence, and no number is missing (\"not broken\", e.g. `\"1 2 4 3\"`)\n* `1` if there are any non-numeric elements in the input (\"invalid\", e.g. `\"1 2 a\"`)\n* `n` if the elements are part of such a sequence, but some numbers are missing, and `n` is the lowest of them (\"broken\", e.g. `\"1 2 4\"` or `\"1 5\"`)\n\n\n## Examples\n```\n\"1 2 3 4\"  ==>  return 0, because the sequence is complete\n\n\"1 2 4 3\"  ==>  return 0, because the sequence is complete (order doesn't matter)\n\n\"2 1 3 a\"  ==>  return 1, because it contains a non numerical character\n\n\"1 3 2 5\"  ==>  return 4, because 4 is missing from the sequence\n\n\"1 5\"      ==>  return 2, because the sequence is missing 2, 3, 4 and 2 is the lowest\n\n```",
