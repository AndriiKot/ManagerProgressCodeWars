  "description": "# Reducing by rules to get the result\n\nYour task is to reduce a list of numbers to one number.<br>\nFor this you get a list of rules, how you have to reduce the numbers.<br>\nYou have to use these rules consecutively. So when you get to the end of the list of rules, you start again at the beginning.\n\nAn example is clearer than more words...\n```\nnumbers: [ 2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ]\nrules: [ (a,b) => a + b, (a,b) => a - b ]\nresult: 5.0\n\nYou get a list of four numbers.\nThere are two rules. First rule says: Sum the two numbers a and b. Second rule says: Subtract b from a.\n\nThe steps in progressing:\n1. Rule 1: First number + second number -> 2.0 + 2.0 = 4.0\n2. Rule 2: result from step before - third number -> 4.0 - 3.0 = 1.0\n3. Rule 1: result from step before + forth number -> 1.0 + 4.0 = 5.0\n```\n\nBoth lists/arrays are never null and will always contain valid elements.<br>\nThe list of numbers will always contain more than 1 numbers.<br>\nIn the list of numbers will only be values greater than 0.<br>\nEvery rule takes always two input parameter.\n<br><br><br>\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) \n\nI have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!",
