  "description": "# Two samurai generals are discussing dinner plans after a battle, but they can't seem to agree.\n\nThe discussion gets heated and you are cannot risk favoring either of them as this might damage your political standing with either of the two clans the samurai generals belong to. Thus, the only thing left to do is find what the common ground of what they are saying is.\n\nCompare the proposals with the following function: \n```javascript\nfunction commonGround(s1, s2)\n```\n```python\ndef common_ground(s1,s2)\n```\n```ruby\ndef common_ground(s1,s2)\n```\n\nThe parameters ```s1``` and ```s2``` are the strings representing what each of the generals said. You should output a string containing the words in ```s1``` that also occur in ```s2```.\n\nEach word in the resulting string shall occur once, and the order of the words need to follow the order of the first occurence of each word in ```s2```.\n\nIf they are saying nothing in common, kill both samurai and blame a ninja. (output \"death\")",
