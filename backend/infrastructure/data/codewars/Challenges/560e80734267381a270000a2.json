  "description": "Your work is to write a method that takes a value and an index, and returns the value with the bit at given index flipped.\n\nThe bits are numbered from the least significant bit (index 1).\n\nThe index number can be out of the number's range: e.g. if the number is `3` (`11` in binary, 2 bits) and the index number is `8`, the result will be `131`, i.e. `10000011`.\n\n### Examples:\n```javascript\n(n = 15, index = 4) --> 7\n// 15 in binary is 1111\n// 4th bit is 1\n// after flipping it the number becomes 0111, i.e. 7\n(n = 15, index = 5) --> 31\n// 15 in binary is 1111\n// 5th bit is 0\n// after flipping it the number becomes 11111, i.e. 31\n```\n\n\nSee more examples in test classes\n\n\nGood luck!",
