  "description": "While trying to prove that two functions `f : A → B` and `g : B → A` form an isomorphism between `A` and `B`, I sometimes find it much easier to prove the [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(category_theory)) (`∀ a → g (f a) ≡ a`) than to prove the retraction (`∀ b → f (g b) ≡ b`). But why should I need to prove the retraction? By proving the section I have already shown that the functions are inverses of each other... Why does the proof of isomorphism require both?\n\nBut we are using a proof language! Why speculate when we can prove it to ourselves!\n\n### Task\n\nProve that a section between two functions is not enough to show that the two functions form an isomorphism.\n\n### Preloaded\n\n```agda\nrecord IsIsomorphism {A B : Set} (f : A → B) (g : B → A) : Set where\n  constructor IsIso\n  field\n    section : ∀ (a : A) → g (f a) ≡ a\n    retract : ∀ (b : B) → f (g b) ≡ b\n```",
