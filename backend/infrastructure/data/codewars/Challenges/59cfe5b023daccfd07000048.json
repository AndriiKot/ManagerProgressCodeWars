How many times do i have to fold it to get `n` number of `grids`.\neg.\n```\nn=1 , 0 operation, the original paper is one grid.\n\nn=2, 1 operations, i have to fold it 1 time to get 2 grids (A,B).\n\n _______\n|   |   |\n| A | B |\n|   |   |\n|   |   |\n|___|___|\n```\nNo edge cases, all inputs are valid, But some built-in `Math` functions will have `NO` power here.
