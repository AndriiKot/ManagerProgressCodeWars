  "description": "The number 45 is the first integer in having this interesting property:\nthe sum of the number with its reversed is divisible by the difference between them(absolute Value).\n```\n45 + 54 = 99 \nabs(45 - 54) = 9\n99 is divisible by 9.\n```\nThe first terms of this special sequence are :\n```\nn\t\ta(n)\n1\t\t45\n2\t\t54\n3\t\t495\n4\t\t594\n```\nMake the function that receives ```n```, the ordinal number of the term and may give us, the value of the term of the sequence.\nLet's see some cases (input ----> output):\n```\n1 -----> 45\n3 -----> 495\n```\n\n\"Important: Do not include numbers which, when reversed, have a leading zero, e.g.: 1890 reversed is 0981, so 1890 should not be included.\"\n\nYour code will be tested up to the first 65 terms, so you should think to optimize it as much as you can.\n\n(Hint: I memoize, you memoize, he memoizes, ......they (of course) memoize)\n\nHappy coding!!\n\n",
