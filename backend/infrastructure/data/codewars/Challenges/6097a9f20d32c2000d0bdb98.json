  "description": "### Overview\n\nMany people know that Apple uses the letter \"i\" in almost all of its devices to emphasize its personality.\n\nAnd so John, a programmer at Apple, was given the task of making a program that would add that letter to every word. Let's help him do it, too.\n\n### Task:\nYour task is to make a function that takes the value of **word** and returns it with an \"i\" at the beginning of the word. For example we get the word \"Phone\", so we must return \"iPhone\". But we have a few rules:\n1. The word should not begin with the letter \"I\", for example **Inspire**.\n2. The number of vowels should not be greater than or equal to the number of consonants, for example **East** or **Peace**. (\"y\" is considered a consonant)\n3. The first letter should not be lowercase, for example **road**.\n\nIf the word does not meet the rules, we return \"Invalid word\".",
