  "description": "\nWrite a parameterized PostgreSQL query to find groups with the exact same set of employees as a specified group.\n\nSchema (`groups` table):\n\n* `employee_id` (integer): identifier for each employee.\n* `group_name` (varchar): The name of the group.\n\nTask Instructions:\n\n1) Create a prepared SQL statement named `find_groups_with_matching_employees`.\n2) The statement should take a group name as its parameter (of type text). Use $1 as a placeholder for this parameter.\n3) Return groups that have the same exact set of employees as the group specified in the parameter.\n4) The result should contain the columns `group_name` and `employees` (which is an ordered array of employee IDs. IDs are sorted in ascending order).\n5) The result should be ordered by `group_name` in ascending order.\n\nFor this sample data: \n\n```\n employee_id | group_name \n-------------+------------\n    1        | a1         \n    2        | a1         \n    1        | b1         \n    2        | b1         \n    3        | c1         \n    4        | d1   \n```    \n\nFor the `EXECUTE find_groups_with_matching_employees('a1')`, the expected result would be:    \n\n```\n group_name | employees \n------------+-----------\n b1         | {1,2}     \n``` \n\nGLHF!\n \n           \n                    \n           ",
