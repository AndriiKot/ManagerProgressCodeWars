  "description": "Multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition. Exponentiation can be thought of as repeated multiplication. [Tetration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetration) is repeated exponentiation. Just as the 4th power of 3 is `3*3*3*3`, the 4th tetration of 3 is `3^3^3^3`. By convention, we insert parentheses from right to left, so the 4th tetration of 3 is `3^(3^(3^3))) = 3^(3^27) = 3^7625597484987 = a really big number`\n\n## Your Task\nComplete the function that returns the number that is the `y`th tetration of `x`, where `x` is a positive integer, and `y` is a non-negative integer. The function should return a number (not a string that picks out the number).\n\n**Note:** the convention is that, as with exponentiation, the 0th tetration of any number is always `1`\n\n## Examples (inputs -> output)\n\n```\n* 4, 0  -->     1  (due to the convention mentioned above)\n* 7, 1  -->     7  (7^1)\n* 5, 2  -->  3125  (5^5)\n* 2, 3  -->    16  (2^(2^2))\n```",
