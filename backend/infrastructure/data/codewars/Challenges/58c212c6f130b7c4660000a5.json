  "description": "### Task\n\nDudka has `n` details. He must keep exactly 3 of them.\n\nTo do this, he performs the following operations until he has only 3 details left:\n```\nHe numbers them.\nHe keeps those with either odd or even numbers and throws the others away.\n```\n\nDudka wants to know how many ways there are to get exactly 3 details. Your task is  to help him calculate it.\n\n### Example\n\nFor `n = 6`, the output should be `2`.\n```\nDudka has 6 details, numbered 1 2 3 4 5 6. \nHe can keep either details with numbers 1, 3, 5, \nor with numbers 2, 4, 6. \nBoth options leave him with 3 details, \nso the answer is 2.\n```\n\nFor `n = 7`, the output should be `1`.\n```\nDudka has 7 details, numbered 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. \nHe can keep either details 1 3 5 7, or details 2 4 6. \nIf he keeps details 1 3 5 7 , \nhe won't be able to get 3 details in the future, \nbecause at the next step he will number them 1 2 3 4 \nand will have to keep either details 1 3, or 2 4, \nonly two details anyway. \nThat's why he must keep details 2 4 6 at the first step, \nso the answer is 1.\n```\n\n### Input/Output\n\n\n- `[input]` integer `n`  \n  `3 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`\n\n- `[output]` an integer  \n  The number of ways to get exactly 3 details.",
