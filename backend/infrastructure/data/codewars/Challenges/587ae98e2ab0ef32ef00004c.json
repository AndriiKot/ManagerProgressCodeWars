Most of the parts are made global except the ones made in the factory which do not change.\n\n```\nd[(0)(0)]B \n\nIn all robots the eyes do not change.\n\nd[(0)(0)]B \n\n...0..0...\n   ^  ^            \n   |  | \n\nThe rest of the body can change at random.\n\nlegs any in => abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n...0..0... \n^        ^             \n|        |\n\nbody any in => |};&#[]/><()*\n\n\n...0..0... \n ^^ ^^ ^^            \n || || ||           \n\n\n```\nThere may be cases where a part is totally missing and of course a robot cannot function at all without a part or where the factory put a valid part in the wrong place and it's again not a valid robot.\n\nreturn an array of strings with a count of each of the following tasks.\n\nCase insensitve count of robots in string with \"automatik\" or \"mechanik\". Strings do not contain both \"automatik and \"mechanik\". \n\nReturn an array with the count like below \n\n```\na[0] = automatik count\na[1] = mechanik count\n\n[\"1 robots functioning automatik\", \"1 robots dancing mechanik\"]\n\n```\nto pay tribute...respect :)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Robots\n\nSongwriters: HUETTER, RALF / SCHNEIDER-ESLEBEN, FLORIAN / BARTOS, KARL\n",
