  "description": "### Task\n\nThe longest diagonals of a square matrix are defined as follows:\n\n```\nthe first longest diagonal goes from the top left corner to the bottom right one;\nthe second longest diagonal goes from the top right corner to the bottom left one.\n```\n\nGiven a square `matrix`, your task is to swap its longest diagonals by exchanging their elements at the corresponding positions.\n\n### Example\n\nFor\n```\nmatrix = [[1, 2, 3],\n          [4, 5, 6],\n          [7, 8, 9]]\n```\n\nthe output should be\n\n```\n[[3, 2, 1],\n [4, 5, 6],\n [9, 8, 7]]\n```\n\n### Input/Output\n\n\n- `[input]` 2D integer array `matrix`\n\n   Constraints: `1 ≤ matrix.length ≤ 10, matrix.length = matrix[i].length, 1 ≤ matrix[i][j] ≤ 1000.`\n   \n\n- `[output]` 2D integer array\n\n   Matrix with swapped diagonals.",
