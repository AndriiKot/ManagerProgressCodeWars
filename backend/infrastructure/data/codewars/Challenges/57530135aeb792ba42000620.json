  "description": "## Task\n\nYou are in a maze. There are a lot of doors, you have to find the passcode to open them. There are some numbers next to each door, and you need to find the passcode from these numbers.\n\nYou will receive an integer array ```nums``` containing some numbers like this:\n\n```\n[153456,123406,124456,323456,123458,123756]\n```\n\nHow to find the passcode? Let's change the arrangement method:\n```\n[\n153456,\n123406,\n124456,\n323456,\n123458,\n123756\n]\n\n```\n\nWe can see that each column has one number different from the others, they are the passcode. \n\nPlease find out the passcode and return it as a string value.\n  \n## Examples\n\n```\n[153456,123406,124456,323456,123458,123756]\nshould return \"354708\"\n\n[7347289,3647289,3357289,3344289,3347389,3347229,3347281]\nshould return \"7654321\"\n\n[232326,232363,232523,235323,242323,432323]\nshould return \"445566\"\n\n[13579,13579,13579,13579,24680]\nshould return \"24680\"\n```",
