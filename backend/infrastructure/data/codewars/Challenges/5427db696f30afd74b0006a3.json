  "description": "# Task\n\nYour task is to write a function for calculating the score of a 10 pin bowling game. The input for the function is a list of pins knocked down per roll for one player. Output is the player's total score.\n\n# Rules\n\n## General rules\nRules of bowling in a nutshell:\n\n* A game consists of 10 frames. In each frame the player rolls 1 or 2 balls, except for the 10th frame, where the player rolls 2 or 3 balls.\n\n* The total score is the sum of your scores for the 10 frames\n\n* If you knock down fewer than 10 pins with 2 balls, your frame score is the number of pins knocked down\n\n* If you knock down all 10 pins with 2 balls (spare), you score the amount of pins knocked down plus a bonus - amount of pins knocked down with the next ball\n\n* If you knock down all 10 pins with 1 ball (strike), you score the amount of pins knocked down plus a bonus - amount of pins knocked down with the next 2 balls\n\n## Rules for 10th frame\nAs the 10th frame is the last one, in case of spare or strike there will be no next balls for the bonus. To account for that:\n\n* if the last frame is a spare, player rolls 1 bonus ball.\n* if the last frame is a strike, player rolls 2 bonus balls.\n\nThese bonus balls on 10th frame are only counted as a bonus to the respective spare or strike.\n\n# More information\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring\n\n# Input\nYou may assume that the input is always valid. This means:\n\n* input list length is correct\n* number of pins knocked out per roll is valid\n",
