  "description": "An expression is formed by taking the digits 1 to 9 in numerical order and then inserting into each gap between the numbers either a plus sign or a minus sign or neither.\n\nYour task is to write a method which takes one parameter and returns the **smallest possible number** of plus and minus signs necessary to form such an expression which equals the input.\n\n**Note:** All digits from 1-9 must be used exactly once.\n\nIf there is no possible expression that evaluates to the input, then return `null/nil/None`.\n\n~~~if:haskell\n`eval :: String -> Int` is available in `Preloaded` for your convenience.\n~~~\n\nThere are 50 random tests (100 in JavaScript), with input being an integer with with upper bound of 1000.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nWhen the input is 100, you need to return `3`, since that is the minimum number of signs required, because: 123 - 45 - 67 + 89 = 100 (3 operators in total).\n\nMore examples:\n```\n 11  -->  5  #  1 + 2 + 34 + 56 + 7 - 89 = 11\n100  -->  3  #  123 - 45 - 67 + 89 = 100\n766  -->  4  #  1 - 2 + 34 - 56 + 789 = 766\n160  -->  -  #  no solution possible\n```\n\nInspired by a [puzzle on BBC Radio 4](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p057wxwl) (which is unfortunately not available anymore)",
