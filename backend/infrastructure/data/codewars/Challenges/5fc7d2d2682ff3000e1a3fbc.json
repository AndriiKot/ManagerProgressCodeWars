  "description": "In this kata, you have an input string and you should check whether it is a valid message. To decide that, you need to split the string by the numbers, and then compare the numbers with the number of characters in the following substring.\n\nFor example `\"3hey5hello2hi\"` should be split into `3, hey, 5, hello, 2, hi` and the function should return `true`, because `\"hey\"` is 3 characters, `\"hello\"` is 5, and `\"hi\"` is 2; as the numbers and the character counts match, the result is `true`.\n      \n      \n**Notes:**\n* Messages are composed of only letters and digits\n* Numbers may have multiple digits: e.g. `\"4code13hellocodewars\"` is a valid message\n* Every number must match the number of character in the following substring, otherwise the message is invalid: e.g. `\"hello5\"` and `\"2hi2\"` are invalid\n* If the message is an empty string, you should return `true`\n",
