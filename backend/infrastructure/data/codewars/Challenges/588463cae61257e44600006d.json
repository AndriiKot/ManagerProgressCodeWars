  "description": "# Task\n You are standing at a magical well. It has two positive integers written on it: `a` and `b`. Each time you cast a magic marble into the well, it gives you `a * b` dollars and then both `a` and `b` increase by 1. You have `n` magic marbles. How much money will you make?\n\n# Example\n\n For a = 1, b = 2 and n = 2, the output should be `8`\n\n You will cast your first marble and get $2, after which the numbers will become 2 and 3. When you cast your second marble, the well will give you $6. Overall, you'll make $8. So, the output is 8.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `a`\n\n    Constraints: `1 ≤ a ≤ 2000`\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `b`\n\n   Constraints: `1 ≤ b ≤ 2000`\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `n`\n\n   The number of magic marbles in your possession, a non-negative integer.\n\n   Constraints: `0 ≤ n ≤ 5`\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer",
