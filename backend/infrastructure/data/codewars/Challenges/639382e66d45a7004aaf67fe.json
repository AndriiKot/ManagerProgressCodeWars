Will you jump or not?\"\n\n#### Input\n\n- setting: a string portraying the cliff and its surroundings. The setting represents a 2d portrait view at the cliff, where layers are separated by a newline `'\\n'`. The following characters are used to represent objects in the setting: \n  - cliff `'#'` \n  - ground `'x'` \n  - air `'.'` \n  - water `'~'` \n  - you, the jumper `'Y'`.\n\n#### Output\n\n- return an array containing 2-ples of integers, each 2-tuple consisting of the number of units to jump down and the number of units to jump sideways (right = positive number, left = negative number); add a 2-ple for each possible jump you could make, order does not matter; return an empty array if no possible jump could be made\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary style=\"\n    padding: 3px;\n    width: 100%;\n    border: none;\n    font-size: 18px;\n    box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px #bbbbbb; \n    cursor: pointer;\">\n  Specification</summary>\n\n#### Your qualities / shortcomings / behaviors\n\n- you can jump at most 2 units in horizontal direction\n- you can jump at most 2 units in vertical direction if the surface below the target location is solid (ground or cliff)\n- you can jump at most 4 units in vertical direction if the surface below the target location is shallow water (water with a depth of 1 unit)\n- you can jump at most 8 units in vertical direction if the surface below the target location is deep water (water with a depth of 2 units or more)\n- you will never jump from more than 8 units in vertical direction\n- if you can't see the surface below you, you don't jump\n- you cannot jump over other cliffs next to you or onto higher cliffs next to you\n\n#### Positions before jumping\n\n- you are always standing on top of the cliff, but possibly with some cliffs to the left or right of you at person height\n- it may be the case that zero, one or multiple jumps are possible from the starting location\n- a jump is only valid when you jump at least 1 unit down and at least 1 unit sideways; Height of the jump is measured from where you stand to where you hit either solid surface or water. So falling into the water does not count as jumping height.\n\n#### Positions after jumping\n\n- a jump ends when landing on a solid surface (ground or cliff), in shallow water, in deep water on water level when the vertical distance of the jump was not more than 4 units, or in deep water 1 unit below water level if the vertical distance of the jump was more than 4 units\n- note that you land ___on___ solid surface, or ___in___ water; so when jumping `n` units down, you will end up `n` units lower when landing on solid surface, `n + 1` units lower if you hit shallow water or deep water if `n` is lower than 5, or `n + 2` units down when landing in deep water when `n` is higher than 4. \n\n#### Physics\n\n- air can't go under water\n- water can't lean on air, it will always be contained; it can be on the same level as solid surface though (like a beach); it can also be on same level as the jumper\n- once you jump, you cannot change horizontal direction mid air\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary style=\"\n    padding: 3px;\n    width: 100%;\n    border: none;\n    font-size: 18px;\n    box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px #bbbbbb;
