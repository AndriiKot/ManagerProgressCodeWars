  "description": "You are given a denormalized database table called `world_population` with columns `id`, `country`, `year`, and `population`. The table contains population data for various countries over the years.\n\nYour task is to write a SQL query that finds the top 5 countries with the highest population increase `strictly` between the years 2000 and 2020, inclusive. The result should show the country name and the population increase in millions, rounded to 2 decimal places. The query should group the results by country and sort them in descending order based on the population increase.\n\n##### Notes:\n\n* `population_increase` should be obtained by dividing the result by 1,000,000 to convert the number to millions, rounding it to 2 decimal places and afterwards by adding an abbreviation for millions, \"M\", to the end of result.\n* for the sample test is used static actual data taken from the United Nations, for the final solution - random test.\n* for this task there is no data missing, so you don't need to take into account that data for a year for some countries may be lacking\n* to avoid ambiguety: by \"increase\" is simply meant \"population at year `y1` - population at year `y2`\".\n\n### Schema:\n\n#### `world_population` table:\n\n```\nColumn      | Type          | Modifiers\n------------+---------------+-----------\nid          | integer       | not null\ncountry     | varchar(255)  | not null\npopulation  | bigint        | not null\nyear        | smallint      | not null\n```\n\n### Desired Output\n\nThe desired output should look like this:\n```\ncountry      | population_increase\n-------------+-------------------+\nChina        | 436.55 M          |\nIndia        | 195.85 M          | \n...\n```\n\n",
