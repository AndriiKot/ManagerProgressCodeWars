  "description": "You are given an integer N. Your job is to figure out how many substrings inside of N divide evenly with N.\n\nConfused? I'll break it down for you.\n\nLet's say that you are given the integer '877692'.\n````\n8 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/8 = 109711 with 4 remainder.\n\n7 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/7 = 125384 with 4 remainder.\n\n7 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/7 = 125384 with 4 remainder.\n\n6 evenly divides with 877692. 877692/6 = 146282 with 0 remainder.\n\n9 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/9 = 97521 with 3 remainder.\n\n2 evenly divides with 877692. 877692/2 = 438846 with 0 remainder.\n\n````\n\nWe aren't going to stop there though. We need to check ALL of the substrings inside of 877692.\n\n````\n87 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/87 = 10088 with 36 remainder.\n\n77 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/77 = 11398 with 46 remainder.\n\n76 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/76 = 11548 with 44 remainder.\n\n69 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/69 = 12720 with 12 remainder.\n\n\netc.\n\n````\n\n# Rules:  \n-If an integer is 0, then it does NOT divide evenly into anything.  \n-Even though N can divide evenly with itself, we do not count it towards the end number. For Example: \n````\nN = 23, the answer will be 0.  \n````\n-If there are multiple instances of a number, they all get counted. For example: \n````\nN = 11, the answer will be 2 \n````\n\n# Input:\nA non negative integer.\n\n# Output:\nThe number of times you found an integer that was evenly divisible with N.\n",
