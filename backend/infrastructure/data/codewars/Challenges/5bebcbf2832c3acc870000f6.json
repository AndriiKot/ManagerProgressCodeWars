  "description": "# Introduction\n\nA new casino has come to Las Vegas, but this casino does not want to have human staff, but they want to implement a series of computer systems that automate the process. After looking for references and recommendations, the administrative team has decided to hire you to develop these systems.\n\nYour assignment is to complete the function that draws cards for the dealer, and returns the players who have won.\n\n\n## Rules\n\n* Each table will consist of 3 players, `\"Player 1\"`, `\"Player 2\"`, `\"Player 3\"`\n* Players play against the croupier (dealer) only, not against other players.\n* Each card has its value: the numerals are worth whatever their number indicates; `\"J\"`, `\"Q\"` and `\"K\"` are worth `10`; `\"A\"` may be worth `11 or 1`, always trying to keep the highest score possible.\n* If any player exceeds `21` points, they lose.\n* The croupier must draw from a deck until it's hand scores `17` or more points.\n* A player has a blackjack when they have 2 cards, one worth `10`, and an `\"A\"`\n* If the player has a blackjack, then they win, **unless** the croupier also has a blackjack.\n* When the croupier draws a card, the croupier draws the first card from a deck.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* The inputs will never be null.\n* All letters are in uppercase\n\n\n## Examples\n\n* Player 1: `\"J\", \"A\"` (21, blackjack)\n* Player 2: `\"10\", \"5\", \"6\"` (21)\n* Player 3: `\"3\", \"6\", \"A\", \"3\", \"A\", \"K\"` (24)\n* Croupier: `\"9\", \"7\"` (16)\n* Deck: `\"5\", \"4\", \"K\", \"2\"`\n\nSince the dealer has less than 17 points, it must draw a card:\n* Croupier: `\"9\", \"7\", \"5\"` (21)\n* Deck: `\"4\", \"K\", \"2\"`\n\nNow comparing hands:\n* Player 1 scores 21, croupier scores 21, but Player 1 has Black Jack, so Player 1 won\n* Player 2 scores 21, croupier scores 21, draw\n* Player 3 scores 24, Player 3 exceeded 21, so he lost\n\n~~~if:javascript\nSo return `\"Player 1\"`\n~~~\n~~~if-not:javascript\nSo return `[\"Player 1\"]`\n~~~\n\n*And another example:*\n\n* Player 1: `\"10\", \"K\"` (20)\n* Player 2: `\"10\", \"2\", \"6\"` (18)\n* Player 3: `\"8\", \"8\", \"5\"` (21)\n* Croupier: `\"5\", \"10\"` (15)\n* Deck: `\"A\" , \"3\" , \"K\" , \"2\"`\n\nSince the dealer has less than 17 points, it must draw more cards:\n* Croupier: `\"5\", \"10\", \"A\", \"3\"`  (19)\n* Deck: `\"K\", \"2\"`\n\nNow comparing hands:\n* Player 1 scores 20, croupier scores 19, Player 1 won\n* Player 2 scores 18, croupier scores 19, Player 2 lost\n* Player 3 scores 21, croupier scores 19, Player 3 won\n\n~~~if:javascript\nSo return `\"Player 1, Player 3\"`\n~~~\n~~~if-not:javascript\nSo return `[\"Player 1\", \"Player 3\"]`\n~~~",
