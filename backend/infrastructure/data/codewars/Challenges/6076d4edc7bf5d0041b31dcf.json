  "description": "## Task\n\nImplement a function that takes an unsigned 32 bit integer as input and sorts its bytes in descending order, returning the resulting (unsigned 32 bit) integer.\n\nAn alternative way to state the problem is as follows: The number given as input is made up of four bytes. Reorder these bytes so that the resulting (unsigned 32 bit) integer is as large as possible.\n\n## Example\n\n```\nInput: 3735928559\n  \n3735928559 is 0xdeadbeef in hexadecimal representation and 11011110 10101101 10111110 11101111\nin binary representation.\n  \nAfter sorting the bytes in descending order the resulting unsigned 32 bit integer is 4024352429 \nin decimal representation, which is 0xefdebead in hexadecimal and 11101111 11011110 10111110 10101101\nin binary.\n\nOutput should be: 4024352429\n```",
