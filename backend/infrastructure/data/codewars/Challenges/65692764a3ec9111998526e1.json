  "description": "Graciela loves planes, so she goes to the airport to watch them fly away. Every 15 minutes a new plane takes off, with the first one of the day departing at 00:00 (12 AM).\n\nGiven the time Graciela arrives at the airport and the time she leaves, write a function that calculates how many planes she'll be able to watch take off.\n\n**Examples**\n\n- If Graciela arrives at 12:00 and leaves at 13:00, she'll be able to watch 5 planes take off, leaving at 12:00, 12:15, 12:30, 12:45 and 13:00 respectively.\n\n  - If she arrives at 12:03, she'll be able to watch one plane less, as she missed the 12:00 departure.\n\n  - If she leaves at 13:24, she'll be able to watch one plane more, as she caught the 13:15 plane.\n\n- If Graciela arrives at 23:45 and leaves at 00:16, she'll be able to watch 3 planes take off, leaving at 23:45, 00:00 and 00:15 respectively.\n\n- If Graciela arrives at 06:31 and leaves at 06:44, she won't be able to catch any planes.",
