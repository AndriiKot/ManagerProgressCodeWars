  "description": "The triangular numbers, ```Tn```,  may be obtained by this formula:\n```math\n\\quad T(n) = \\dfrac { n \\cdot (n + 1) } 2\n```\nWe select, for example, the first ```5 (n terms)``` consecutive terms of this sequence.\n\nThey will be: ```1, 3, 6, 10 and 15```\n\nNow we want to obtain, again for example, the first ```8 (m terms)``` consecutive multiples to all of these five triangular numbers.\n\nThe least common multiple of them will be, ```30```, so the first eight multiple terms (for the sequence of the above five triangular numbers) will be:\n\n```30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240``` \n\nFinally the sum of all these multiples will be:\n```30 + 60 + 90 + 120 + 150 + 180 + 210 + 240 = 1080``` \n\nWe want a function that may calculate this sum with different values of n and m terms.\n\nLet's see some cases:\n```python\nn = 5\nm = 8\n# Should return 1080\n```\n\nAnother case:\n```python\nn = 7\nm = 10\n# Should return 23100\n```\n\nThe values of ```n``` and ```m``` will be always integer values higher than ```2```.\n\nEnjoy it!!\n\n\n",
