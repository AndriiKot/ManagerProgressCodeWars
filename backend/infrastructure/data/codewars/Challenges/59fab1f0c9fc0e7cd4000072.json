  "description": "In this Kata, we are going to see how a Hash (or Map or dict) can be used to keep track of characters in a string. \n\nConsider two strings `\"aabcdefg\"` and `\"fbd\"`. How many characters do we have to remove from the first string to get the second string?  Although not the only way to solve this, we could create a Hash of counts for each string and see which character counts are different. That should get us close to the answer. I will leave the rest to you. \n\nFor this example, `solve(\"aabcdefg\",\"fbd\") = 5`. Also, `solve(\"xyz\",\"yxxz\") = 0`, because we cannot get second string from the first since the second string is longer.\n\nMore examples in the test cases.\n\nGood luck!",
