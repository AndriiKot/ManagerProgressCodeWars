  "description": "In this Kata, you have to write a function that will accept an array of numbers, in which you will need to check whether any combination of 3 numbers sum to `0`. <br>You are allowed to use a number more than once, as long as you use only 3 numbers total (e.g. 0+0+1 ).\n\n\nIf a value of `0` is possible return `true`.<br>\nOtherwise, if there is no possible combination of 3 numbers that sum to `0` return `false`.\n\n\nExamples\n---------\nFor example let's take the array `[ -10, 4, 5, 7, 3 ]`. There is a possible combination that sums to 0 => `-10 + 7 + 3 = 0`. <br>Therefore,  passing this array to our function should return `true`. \n\nAnother example: the array `[0]` has one number but there still is a possible combination that will result in 0 => `0 + 0 + 0`. The result is `true`.\n\nFinally, the array `[1,4,2,-9]` doesn't have any combination of 3 numbers that sum to 0 and therefore should return `false`.\n\n\n\nGo get em!\n\n",
