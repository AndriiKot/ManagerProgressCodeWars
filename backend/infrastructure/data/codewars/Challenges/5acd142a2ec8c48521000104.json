  "description": "*Inspired by [Square Every Digit](https://www.codewars.com/kata/square-every-digit) and by the inimitable myjinxin2015's many clever one-line katas*\n\nYour goal here is precisely the same: square every digit of the given integer, in as few characters as possible.\n\nYour return value should be in integer format. Your input will always be a valid, non-negative integer, may be > 2<sup>31</sup>\n\n```if:javascript\n**Code size limit: 36 characters or less**\n```\n```if:ruby\n**Code size limit: 47 characters or less**\n\n*Note: spaces do _not_ count towards your total-- within reason**. Spacing shouldn't be more than 30% of your total to avoid possible cheats.*\n```\n```if:python\n**Code size limit: 56 bytes or less**\n```\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\n0     -->  0\n64    -->  3616\n1111  -->  1111\n2222  -->  4444\n3333  -->  9999\n3212  -->  9414\n1234  -->  14916\n77455754  -->  4949162525492516\n99999999  -->  8181818181818181\n```\n\nP.S., if you can get the sample tests to pass while under the character limit, the full tests should pass without a hitch!\n\nHave fun, and please upvote if you enjoyed it :)\n\nFound this one too easy?  [This one's a bit more difficult!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a905291fd57772be0000039\">)\n\nToo hard?
