  "description": "For this challenge you need to create a basic Age Calculator function which calculates the age in years on the age field of the peoples table.\n\nThe function should be called `agecalculator`, it needs to take 1 date and calculate the age in years according to the date `NOW` and must return an integer.\n\nYou may query the people table while testing but the query must only contain the function on your final submit.\n\n### people table schema\n- id\n- name\n- age  \n\n> NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.",
