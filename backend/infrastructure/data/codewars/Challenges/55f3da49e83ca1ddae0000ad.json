  "description": "To introduce the problem think to my neighbor who drives a tanker truck. \nThe level indicator is down and he is worried\nbecause he does not know if he will be able to make deliveries. \nWe put the truck on a horizontal ground and measured the height of the liquid in the tank.\n\nFortunately the tank is a perfect cylinder and the vertical walls on each end are flat.\nThe height of the remaining liquid is `h`, the diameter of the cylinder base is `d`,\nthe total volume is `vt` (h, d, vt are positive or null integers). \nYou can assume that `h` <= `d`.\n\nCould you calculate the remaining volume of the liquid?\nYour function `tankvol(h, d, vt)` returns an integer which is the truncated result (e.g floor)\nof your float calculation.\n\n#### Examples:\n\n```\ntankvol(40,120,3500) should return 1021 (calculation gives about: 1021.26992027)\n\ntankvol(60,120,3500) should return 1750\n\ntankvol(80,120,3500) should return 2478 (calculation gives about: 2478.73007973)\n```\n\n#### Tank vertical section:\n\n![alternative text](http://i.imgur.com/wmt0U43.png)",
