  "description": "Given a string as input, return a new string with each letter pushed to the right by its respective index in the alphabet.\n\nWe all know that `A` is a slow and `Z` is a fast letter. This means that `Z` gets shifted to the right by 25 spaces, `A` doesn't get shifted at all, and `B` gets shifted by 1 space.\n\nYou can assume the following things about your input:\n\n- It will only contain uppercase letters from `A` to `Z`, no whitespaces or punctuation;\n- Input strings will not exceed 100 characters (although your output string might!)\n\nNote that if 2 or more letters fall onto the same space after shifting, the latest character will be used. For example: `\"BA\" -> \" A\"`\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n\"AZ\"   -->  \"A                         Z\"\n\"ABC\"  -->  \"A B C\"\n\"ACE\"  -->  \"A  C  E\"\n\"CBA\"  -->  \"  A\"\n\"HELLOWORLD\"  -->  \"     E H    DLL   OLO   R  W\"\n```",
