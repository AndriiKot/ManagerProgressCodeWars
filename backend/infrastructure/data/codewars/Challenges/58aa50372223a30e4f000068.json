  "description": "# Task\n Given a string which represents a valid arithmetic expression, find the index of the character in the given expression corresponding to the arithmetic operation which needs to be computed first.\n\n Note that several operations of the same type with equal priority are computed from left to right.\n\n# Example\n\n For `expr = \"(2 + 2) * 2\"`, the output should be 3.\n\n There are two operations in the expression: `+ and *`. The result of `+` should be computed first, since it is enclosed in parentheses. Thus, the output is the index of the '+' sign, which is `3`.\n\n For `expr = \"2 + 2 * 2\"`, the output should be `6`.\n\n There are two operations in the given expression: `+ and *`. Since there are no parentheses, `*` should be computed first as it has higher priority. The answer is the position of '*', which is `6`.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` string `expr`\n\n  A string consisting of digits, parentheses, addition and multiplication signs (pluses and asterisks). It is guaranteed that there is at least one arithmetic sign in it. \n\n - `[output]` an integer\n \n  The index of the operation character which needs to be computed first.",
