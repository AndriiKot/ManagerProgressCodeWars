  "description": "# Description:\n\n Give you a sentence `s`. It contains some words and separated by spaces. Another arguments is `n`, its a number(1,2 or 3). You should convert `s` to  camelCase n.\n \n There are three kinds of camelCase:\n \n ```\n camelCase 1: The first letter of each word should be capitalized. \n               Except for the first word.\n \n Example: \"Hello world\"  -->  \"helloWorld\"\n \n camelCase 2: The last letter of each word should be capitalized. \n               Except for the last word. \n \n Example: \"Hello world\"  -->  \"hellOworld\"\n \n camelCase 3: The first and last letters of each word should be capitalized. \n               Except for the first and lasts letter of sentence. \n \n Example: \"Hello world\"  -->  \"hellOWorld\" \n \n ```\n \n You can assume that all of the input data is valid. That is: `s` always be a string; It contains at least two words; Each word contains only letters(a-zA-Z); Each word contains ar least three letters; `n` always be 1,2 or 3.\n \n \n# Examples\n\n```\ntoCamelCase(\"hello world\",1) === \"helloWorld\"\ntoCamelCase(\"hello world\",2) === \"hellOworld\"\ntoCamelCase(\"hello world\",3) === \"hellOWorld\"\n\ntoCamelCase(\"Hello world\",1) === \"helloWorld\"\n\ntoCamelCase(\"Each number plus one\",1) === \"eachNumberPlusOne\"\ntoCamelCase(\"Each number plus one\",2) === \"eacHnumbeRpluSone\"\ntoCamelCase(\"Each number plus one\",3) === \"eacHNumbeRPluSOne\"\n```\n\nRandom tests may contains bug(I'm not sure), please test and feedback, thanks ;-)",
