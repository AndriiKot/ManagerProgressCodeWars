  "description": "The **regular paperfolding sequence**<sup>[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_paperfolding_sequence)</sup>, also known as the **dragon curve sequence**, is an infinite automatic sequence of `0`s and `1`s defined as a fixed point of the morphism\n\n    1 1 → 1 1 0 1\n    0 1 → 1 0 0 1\n    1 0 → 1 1 0 0\n    0 0 → 1 0 0 0\n\nas follows:\n\n    1 1 → 1 1 0 1 → 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 → 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 → ..\n\n# Task\n\nGiven an array of `0`s and `1`s, return if it is a leading substring ( prefix ) of this sequence.\n\n# Performance\n\nThere will be `100` performance random tests, up to `100 000 000` elements.\n\nRequired time complexity is intended to be `O(n)`. There is little tolerance for `O(n log n)` solutions, or even `O(n)` solutions with largish constant factors or overhead. This kata may require micro-optimisations.\n\n# See also\n\n[The PaperFold sequence](https://www.codewars.com/kata/the-paperfold-sequence/)",
