  "description": "## The Problem\n\nJames is a DJ at a local radio station. As it's getting to the top of the hour, he needs to find a song to play that will be short enough to fit in before the news block. He's got a database of songs that he'd like you to help him filter in order to do that.\n\n## What To Do\n\nCreate `longestPossible`(`longest_possible` in python and ruby) helper function that takes 1 integer argument which is a maximum length of a song in seconds.\n\n`songs` is an array of objects which are formatted as follows:\n\n```javascript\n{artist: 'Artist', title: 'Title String', playback: '04:30'}\n```\n```python\n{'artist': 'Artist', 'title': 'Title String', 'playback': '04:30'}\n```\n```ruby\n{artist: 'Artist', title: 'Title String', playback: '04:30'}\n```\n\nYou can expect playback value to be formatted exactly like above.\n\nOutput should be a title of the longest song from the database that matches the criteria of not being longer than specified time. If there's no songs matching criteria in the database, return `false`.\n",
