  "description": "My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!\n\nIn honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!\n\n* Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.  \n* Multiply each number by itself.  \n* Add them all together.  \n* Take the square root of the result.  \n* Divide by two.\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\npredictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86\n```\n```R\npredict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86\n```\n```python\npredict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86\n```\n```ruby\npredict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86\n```\n```crystal\npredict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86\n```\n```c++\npredictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86\n```\n```php\npredictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86\n```\n```csharp\npredictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86\n```\n```lua\nPredicter.predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86\n```\n\n\n\nNote: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\nSome random tests might fail due to a bug in the JavaScript implementation. Simply resubmit if that happens to you.",
