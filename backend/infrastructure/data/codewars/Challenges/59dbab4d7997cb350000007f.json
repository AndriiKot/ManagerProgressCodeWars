  "description": "Two strings ```a``` and b are called isomorphic if there is a one to one mapping possible for every character of ```a``` to every character of ```b```. And all occurrences of every character in ```a``` map to same character in ```b```.\n\n## Task\n\nIn this kata you will create a function that return ```True``` if two given strings are isomorphic to each other, and ```False``` otherwise. Remember that order is important.\n\nYour solution must be able to handle words with more than 10 characters.\n\n## Example\nTrue:\n```\nCBAABC DEFFED\nXXX YYY\nRAMBUNCTIOUSLY THERMODYNAMICS\n```\n\nFalse:\n```\nAB CC\nXXY XYY\nABAB CD\n```",
