  "description": "An ATM has banknotes of nominal values 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 dollars.\nYou can consider that there is a large enough supply of each of these banknotes.\n\nYou have to write the ATM's function that determines the minimal number of banknotes needed to honor a withdrawal of `n` dollars, with `1 <= n <= 1500`.\n\nReturn that number, or `-1` if it is impossible.\n\nGood Luck!!!",
