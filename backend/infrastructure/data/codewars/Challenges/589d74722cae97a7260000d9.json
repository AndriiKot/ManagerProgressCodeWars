  "description": "Mr. Odd is my friend. Some of his common dialogues are: _\"Am I looking odd?\", \"It’s looking very odd\",_ etc. Actually, \"odd\" is his favorite word. This Valentine's Day he went to meet his girlfriend, but he forgot to take a gift. So he told her that he did an _odd_ thing. His girlfriend became angry and gave him a puzzle. She gave him a string (`str`) that contains only lowercase letters and told him:\n\n> _Take 3 indexes `i, j, k` such that `i < j < k` and `str[i] = \"o\", str[j] = \"d\", str[k] = \"d\"` and **cut them from the string** to make a new string `\"odd\"`. How many such new strings can you make?_\n\nMr. Odd wants to impress his girlfriend, so he wants to make the maximum number of `\"odd\"` strings. As he is lazy, he asks you to help him and find the possible maximum.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nFor `\"oudddbo\"` the result should be 1:\n\n* cut one `\"odd\"`: `\"[o]u[d][d]dbo\"  -->  \"_u__dbo\"`\n* no more `\"odd\"` in string\n\nFor `\"ooudddbd\"` the result should be 2:\n \n* 1: `\"[o]ou[d][d]dbd\"  -->  \"_ou__dbd\"`\n* 2: `\"_[o]u__[d]b[d]\"  -->  \"__u___b_\"`\n* no more `\"odd\"` in string\n\n\n## Input/Output\n\n- `[input]` string `str`: a non-empty string that contains only lowercase letters, `0 < str.length <= 10 000`\n- `[output]` an integer: the maximum number of `\"odd\"` that can be cut\n",
