  "description": "Create a function which compares two probabilities, returning true if the first one is most likely otherwise false.\n\nFor this exercise probability is expressed as two numbers separated by a colon e.g. a probability of 1 in 3 will be ```1:3```.\n\nSo:\n```\nInput: ('1:3','1:2') - returns false as 1 in 3 is less likely than 1 in 2.\n```\n\n",
