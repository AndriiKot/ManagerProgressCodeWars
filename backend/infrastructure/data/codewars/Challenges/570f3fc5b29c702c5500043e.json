  "description": "\n\nThis is the simple version of Shortest Code series. If you need a tougher challenge, please [try that challenge.](http://www.codewars.com/kata/570e8d5693214b0095001b08)\n\n## Task: \n  An important person was murdered, he said the name of the murderer before he died, but because the sound was so low it was difficult to identify.\n    \n   Given two parameters: \n    \n   ```said```, a string, what the person said before death;\n    \n   ```said``` starts with the first letter of the name, each \"~\" represents an uncertain letter, the length of the said does not mean the length of the name, because he might have died before he could say the full name of the murderer.\n    \n   ```suspects```, a string array, name list of all suspects.\n    \n   Please refer to ```said```, find the murderer from the ```suspects```.\n    \n   Result will be a string. If not found, should return ```\"\"```, if more than one suspect is found, return the name of all, separated by ','.\n\n\n### Example: \n\n   ```\n    \n   Example1:\n    \n    said='b~~~~~~~~~~~~~~l'\n    it means the murderer's name first char is 'b',last char is 'l'\n    (Because it is spoken, so please ignore the case)\n    \n    suspects=['Bernard Deltheil','Peter Gone','Peter Reeves','Roland Scorsini']\n    Let's us search in suspects, Wow~~, 'Bernard Deltheil' maybe is the murderer.\n    \n    So, return a string: 'Bernard Deltheil'\n    \n    Example2:\n    said='p~t~r'\n    it means the murderer's name first char is 'p',3rd char is 't',5th char is 'r'\n    \n    suspects=['Bernard Deltheil','R Steell','Peter Gone','Peter Reeves','Roland Scorsini']\n    Wow~, 'Peter Gone' and 'Peter Reeves' maybe is the murderer.\n    \n    So, return a string: 'Peter Gone,Peter Reeves'\n    \n    Example3:\n    said='a~b~c~~d'\n    \n    suspects=['Bernard Deltheil','R Steell','Peter Gone','Peter Reeves','Roland Scorsini']\n    It seems the murderer's name is not appear in the suspects.\n    \n    So, return a empty string: ''\n  ```\n    \n    \n### Series:\n - [Bug in Apple](http://www.codewars.com/kata/56fe97b3cc08ca00e4000dc9)\n - [Father and Son](http://www.codewars.com/kata/56fe9a0c11086cd842000008)\n - [Jumping Dutch act](http://www.codewars.com/kata/570bcd9715944a2c8e000009)\n - [Planting Trees](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5710443187a36a9cee0005a1)\n - [Give me the equation](http://www.codewars.com/kata/56fe9b65cc08cafbc5000de3)\n - [Find the murderer](http://www.codewars.com/kata/570f3fc5b29c702c5500043e)\n - [Reading a Book](http://www.codewars.com/kata/570ca6a520c69f39dd0016d4)\n - [Eat watermelon](http://www.codewars.com/kata/570df12ce6e9282a7d000947)\n - [Special factor](http://www.codewars.com/kata/570e5d0b93214b1a950015b1)\n - [Guess the Hat](http://www.codewars.com/kata/570ef7a834e61306da00035b)\n - [Symmetric Sort](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5705aeb041e5befba20010ba)\n - [Are they symmetrical?](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5705cc3161944b10fd0004ba)\n - [Max Value](http://www.codewars.com/kata/570771871df89cf59b000742)\n - [Trypophobia](http://www.codewars.com/kata/56fe9ffbc25bf33fff000f7c)\n - [Virus in Apple](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5700af83d1acef83fd000048)\n - [Balance Attraction](http://www.codewars.com/kata/57033601e55d30d3e0000633)\n - [Remove screws I](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5710a50d336aed828100055a)\n - [Remove screws II](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5710a8fd336aed00d9000594)\n - [Regular expression compression](http://www.codewars.com/kata/570bae4b0237999e940016e9)\n - [Collatz Array(Split or merge)](http://www.codewars.com/kata/56fe9d579b7bb6b027000001)\n - [Tidy up the room](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5703ace6e55d30d3e0001029)\n - [Waiting for a Bus](http://www.codewars.com/kata/57070eff924f343280000015)\n",
