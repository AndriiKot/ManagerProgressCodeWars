  "description": "In this task, you will work with a PostgreSQL database that contains a table named `ip_addresses`. This table has two columns, `id` (an integer that uniquely identifies each row) and `ip` (a string that contains an IP address). Some of the IP addresses have leading zeros.\n\nYour task is to write a SQL query that returns each `id` and its associated IP address, but with all leading zeros removed from the IP address. The result should be a new column named `cleaned_ip`.\n\nNotes: \n\n* The IP addresses in the table are guaranteed to be valid and always contain exactly four octets, separated by dots. Note that an octet with all zeros (e.g., 000) should be transformed into 0, not removed entirely.\n* The result should be ordered by `id` in descending order.\n\nGLHF!",
