  "description": "# Story\nOnce Mary heard a famous song, and a line from it stuck in her head. That line was \"Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?\". Mary believes that a person is loved if and only if he/she is both young and beautiful, but this is quite a depressing thought, so she wants to put her belief to the test.\n\n# Task\nKnowing whether a person is young, beautiful and loved, find out if they contradict Mary's belief.\n\n A person contradicts Mary's belief if one of the following statements is true:\n```\nthey are young and beautiful but not loved;\nthey are loved but not young or not beautiful.\n```\n\n# Example\n\n For young = true, beautiful = true and loved = true, the output should be `false`.\n\n Young and beautiful people are loved according to Mary's belief.\n\n For young = true, beautiful = false and loved = true, the output should be `true`.\n\n Mary doesn't believe that not beautiful people can be loved.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` boolean `young`\n - `[input]` boolean `beautiful`\n - `[input]` boolean `loved`\n - `[output]` a boolean value\n\n  true if the person contradicts Mary's belief, false otherwise.",
