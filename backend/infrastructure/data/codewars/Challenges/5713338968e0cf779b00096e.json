  "description": "You are given a certain array of positive and negative integers which elements occur only once (all of them different from 0), a certain number known as target, ```t, t ≠ 0```, and a number ```k, k > 0.```\n\nYou should find the amount of combinations, which numbers are not contiguous elements of the given array and which sums (adding up their numbers) are in the range ```[t - k, t + k] (extremes included)```  \n```python\narray = [-4, 2, 1, 6, 4, -3, -1]\nt = 5\nk = 2\nfind_comb_noncontig(array, t, k) == 11\n# The combinations are [6], [4], [2, 4], [1, 4], [6, -3], [6, -1], [4, -1], [2, 6, -3], [2, 6, -1], [2, 4, -1], [1, 4, -1]\n# all of their sums are in the range [3, 7]\n```\nIt is possible that no combinations may be found fulfilling these constraints.\n```python\narray = [-4, 2, 1, 6, 4, -3, -1]\nt = -30\nk = 3\nfind_comb_noncontig(array, t, k) == 0\n```\nEnjoy it!!",
