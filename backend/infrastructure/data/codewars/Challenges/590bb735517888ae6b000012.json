  "description": "We have a square matrix ```M``` of dimension ```n x n``` that has positive and negative numbers in the ranges ```[-9,-1]``` and ```[0,9]```,( the value ```0``` is excluded).\n\nWe want to add up all the products of the elements of the diagonals ```UP-LEFT to DOWN-BOTTOM```, that is the value of```sum1```; and the elements of the diagonals ```UP-RIGHT to LEFT-DOWN``` and that is ```sum2```. Then, as a final result, the value of ```sum1 - sum2```.\n\nE.g.\n```python,cobol,typscript,d,ruby,rust,javascript\nM = [[ 1,  4, 7,  6,  5],\n     [-3,  2, 8,  1,  3],\n     [ 6,  2, 9,  7, -4],\n     [ 1, -2, 4, -2,  6],\n     [ 3,  2, 2, -4,  7]]\n``` \n```julia\nM = [1  4  7  6  5; \n    -3  2  8  1  3; \n     6  2  9  7 -4; \n     1 -2  4 -2  6; \n     3  2  2 -4  7]\n```\nLet's see how to get this result in the image below:\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/MHfydrP\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/MHfydrP.jpg?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nSo the value of ```sum1 - sum2``` is equal to:\n```\n1164 - 66 = 1098\n```\nCreate the code to do this calculation.\n\nFeatures of the random tests:\n```\nNumbers of tests = 150\n5 <= dimension <= 25 (python, ruby and COBOL)\n5 <= dimension <= 20 (javascript)\n-10 < M[i,j] < 0 and 0 < M[i,j] < 10\n```\nThis kata is available in Python2, Ruby, Typescript, D, Cobol, Julia, Rust and Javascript at the moment.\nTranslations into another languages will be released soon.\nEnjoy it!",
