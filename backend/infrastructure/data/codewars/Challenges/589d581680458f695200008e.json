  "description": "## Task\n You are given an array of positive integers. While the array has more than one element you can choose two elements and replace them with their sum or product.\n \n Your task is to find the maximum possible number that can remain in the array after multiple such operations.\n\n## Example\n\n For `arr = [1, 3, 2]`, the result should be `9`.\n \n in order to maximize the answer the first operation will be `1 + 2` (the array changes into `[3, 3]`) and the next `3 * 3` (the array changes into `[9]`), so the final result is 9.\n\n## Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer array arr\n\n   array of positive integers\n\n \n - `[output]` an integer\n\n  maximum possible leftover",
