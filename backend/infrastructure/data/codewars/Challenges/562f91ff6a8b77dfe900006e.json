  "description": "My friend John likes to go to the cinema. He can choose between system A and system B.\n```\nSystem A : he buys a ticket (15 dollars) every time\nSystem B : he buys a card (500 dollars) and a first ticket for 0.90 times the ticket price, \nthen for each additional ticket he pays 0.90 times the price paid for the previous ticket.\n```\n#### Example: \nIf John goes to the cinema 3 times:\n```\nSystem A : 15 * 3 = 45\nSystem B : 500 + 15 * 0.90 + (15 * 0.90) * 0.90 + (15 * 0.90 * 0.90) * 0.90 ( = 536.5849999999999, no rounding for each ticket)\n```\nJohn wants to know how many times he must go to the cinema so that the *final result* of System B, when rounded *up* to the next dollar, will be cheaper than System A.\n\nThe function `movie` has 3 parameters: `card` (price of the card), `ticket` (normal price of \na ticket), `perc` (fraction of what he paid for the previous ticket) and returns the first `n` such that\n```\nceil(price of System B) < price of System A.\n```\n#### More examples:\n```\nmovie(500, 15, 0.9) should return 43 \n    (with card the total price is 634, with tickets 645)\nmovie(100, 10, 0.95) should return 24 \n    (with card the total price is 235, with tickets 240)\n```",
