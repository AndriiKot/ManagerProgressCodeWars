  "description": "In this kata, you need to write a function that takes a string and a letter as input and then returns the index of the second occurrence of that letter in the string. If there is no such letter in the string, or if the letter occurs only once in the string, `-1` should be returned.\n\nExamples:\n\n<!-- all language will use this block, but this does nice syntax hghlighting -->\n```haskell\nfor inputs  \"Hello world!!!\", 'l'  ->  return 3\nfor inputs  \"Hello world!!!\", 'A'  ->  return -1\n```\n\nGood luck ;) And don't forget to rate this kata if you liked it.",
