  "description": "Odd... `Array.prototype.splice` seems to have gone missing. Guess you'll have to re-write it.\n\nThe method you write should produce the same results as the original. I've given you the main features below, but you can look at [MDN's page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice) for further details.\n\nThe method should take 2 or more arguments:\n\n1. The `from` argument provides an integer number, 0 or greater, to be used as the first index to start changing the array from.\n2. The `count` argument provides an integer number, 0 or greater, that counts how many items should be removed from the `from` index onward.\n2. Any further arguments passed in will be new items to be inserted into the array, starting from the `from` index. These extra arguments are optional.\n\nThe method should return an array containing all items removed by the splice, or an empty array if no items were removed. Changes to the array should be done in-place.",
