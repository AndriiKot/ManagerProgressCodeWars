  "description": "For this kata you will have to forget how to add two numbers.\n\nIt can be best explained using the following meme:\n\n[![Dayane Rivas adding up a sum while competing in the Guatemalan television show \"Combate\" in May 2016](https://i.ibb.co/Y01rMJR/caf.png)](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/girl-at-whiteboard-adding)\n\nIn simple terms, our method does not like the principle of carrying over numbers and just writes down every number it calculates :-)\n\nYou may assume both integers are positive integers.\n\n## Examples \n\n```math\n\\large\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n    & 1 & 6 \\\\\n  + & 1 & 8 \\\\ \\hline\n  & 2 & 1 4 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\qquad\n\\large\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n    & 2 & 6  \\\\\n  + & 3 & 9  \\\\ \\hline\n    & 5 & 15 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\qquad\n```\n&nbsp; \n```math\n\\large\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n    & 1 & 2  & 2 \\\\\n  + &   & 8  & 1 \\\\ \\hline\n    & 1 & 10 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\qquad\n\\large\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n    & 7  & 2 \\\\\n  + &    & 9 \\\\ \\hline\n    & 7 & 11 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\n```\n\n~~~if:java\nYou may assume both integers are positive integers and the result will not be bigger than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`\n~~~\n",
