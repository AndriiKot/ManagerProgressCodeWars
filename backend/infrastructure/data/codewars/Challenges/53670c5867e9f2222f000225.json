  "description": "Suppose I have two vectors: `(a1, a2, a3, ..., aN)` and `(b1, b2, b3, ..., bN)`. The dot product between these two vectors is defined as:\n\n```\na1*b1 + a2*b2 + a3*b3 + ... + aN*bN\n```\n\nThe vectors are classified as orthogonal if the dot product equals zero.\n\n\nComplete the function that accepts two sequences as inputs and returns `true` if the vectors are orthogonal, and `false` if they are not. The sequences will always be correctly formatted and of the same length, so there is no need to check them first.\n\n\n## Examples\n```\n[1, 1, 1], [2, 5, 7]        --> false\n[1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0]  --> true\n```\n",
