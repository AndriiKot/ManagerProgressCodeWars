  "description": "## Problem\n\nThere are `n` apples that need to be divided into four piles. We need two mysterious number `x` and `y`. Let The number of first pile equals to `x+y`, the number of second pile equals to `x-y`, the number of third pile equals to `x*y`, the number of fourth pile equals to `x/y`. We need to calculate how many apples are there in each pile.\n\nOf course, there won't be so many unknowns. We know the total number of apples(`n`) and the second mysterious number(`y`). \n\nFor example: there are 48 apples need to divided into four piles. y=3. that is, 1st pile should be x+3, 2nd pile should be x-3, 3rd pile should be x*3, 4th pile should be x/3.\nDo you know how much `x` is? `x` should be 9, because:\n```\n(9 + 3) + (9 - 3) + (9 * 3) + (9 / 3) = 12 + 6 + 27 + 3 = 48\n```\nSo, 48 apples should be divided into `12, 6, 27, 3`.\n\n## Task\n\nImplement a function that accepts two argument, `n` and `y`, and returns the number of apples in each pile as described above. Each resulting number should be a positive integer. If there's no way to divide the apples, return an empty array/empty value (refer to the function declaration and test cases in your language of choice to see which option is relevant for you).\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nn = 48\ny = 3\nresult = [12, 6, 27, 3]\n\nn = 100\ny = 4\nresult = [20, 12, 64, 4]\n\nn = 24\ny = 4\nresult = []  (no way to divide the apples)\n\nn = 25\ny = 4\nresult = []  ([8,0,16,1] is not a correct answer since you can't have empty piles)\n```",
