  "description": "Factorials are often used in probability and are used as an introductory problem for looping constructs. In this kata you will be summing together multiple factorials.\n\nHere are a few examples of factorials:\n```\n4 Factorial = 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n\n6 Factorial = 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n```\n\nIn this kata you will be given a list of values that you must first find the factorial, and then return their sum.\n\nFor example if you are passed the list `[4, 6]` the equivalent mathematical expression would be `4! + 6!` which would equal `744`.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nNote: Assume that all values in the list are positive integer values > 0 and each value in the list is unique.\n\n~~~if:python\nAlso, you must write your own implementation of factorial, as you cannot use the built-in `math.factorial()` method.\n~~~\n",
