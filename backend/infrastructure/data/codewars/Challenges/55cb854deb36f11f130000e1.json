  "description": "## Debug celsius converter\n\nYour friend is traveling abroad to the United States so he wrote a program to convert fahrenheit to celsius. Unfortunately his code has some bugs.\n\nFind the errors in the code to get the celsius converter working properly.\n\nTo convert fahrenheit to celsius:\n```\ncelsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)\n```\n```if-not:ruby,typescript\nRemember that typically temperatures in the current weather conditions are given in whole numbers. It is possible for temperature sensors to report temperatures with a higher accuracy such as to the nearest tenth. Instrument error though makes this sort of accuracy unreliable for many types of temperature measuring sensors. \n```\n\n```if:ruby\nPlease round to 5dp (use `.round(5)`)\n```\n\n```if:typescript\nPlease round to 5dp (use `Math.round()`)\n```",
