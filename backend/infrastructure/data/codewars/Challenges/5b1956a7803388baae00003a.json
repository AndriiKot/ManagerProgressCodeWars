  "description": "You wrote all your unit test names in camelCase.\nBut some of your colleagues have troubles reading these long test names.\nSo you make a compromise to switch to underscore separation.\n\nTo make these changes fast you wrote a class to translate a camelCase name\ninto an underscore separated name.\n\nImplement the ToUnderscore() method.\n\nExample:\n\n`\"ThisIsAUnitTest\" => \"This_Is_A_Unit_Test\"`\n\n\n**But of course there are always special cases...**\n\nYou also have some calculation tests. Make sure the results don't get split by underscores.\nSo only add an underscore in front of the first number.\n\nAlso Some people already used underscore names in their tests. You don't want to change them.\nBut if they are not split correct you should adjust them.\n\nSome of your colleagues mark their tests with a leading and trailing underscore.\nDon't remove this.\n\nAnd of course you should handle empty strings to avoid unnecessary errors. Just return an empty string then.\n\nExample:\n\n`\"Calculate15Plus5Equals20\" => \"Calculate_15_Plus_5_Equals_20\"`\n\n`\"This_Is_Already_Split_Correct\" => \"This_Is_Already_Split_Correct\"`\n\n`\"ThisIs_Not_SplitCorrect\" => \"This_Is_Not_Split_Correct\"`\n\n`\"_UnderscoreMarked_Test_Name_\" => _Underscore_Marked_Test_Name_\"`\n\n",
