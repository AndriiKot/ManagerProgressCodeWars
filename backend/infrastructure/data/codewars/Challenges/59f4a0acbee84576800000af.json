  "description": "Suppose you have 4 numbers: `0, 9, 6, 4` and 3 strings composed with them:\n```\ns1 = \"6900690040\"\ns2 = \"4690606946\"\ns3 = \"9990494604\"\n```\n\nCompare `s1` and `s2` to see how many positions they have in common:\n`0` at index 3, `6` at index 4, `4` at index 8 : 3 common positions out of ten.\n\nCompare `s1` and `s3` to see how many positions they have in common:\n`9` at index 1, `0` at index 3, `9` at index 5 : 3  common positions out of ten.\n\nCompare `s2` and `s3`. We find 2 common positions out of ten.\n\nSo for the 3 strings we have 8 common positions out of 30 ie 0.2666... or 26.666...%\n\nGiven `n` substrings (n >= 2) in a string `s` our function `pos_average` will calculate the average percentage of positions that are the same\nbetween the `(n * (n-1)) / 2` sets of substrings taken amongst the given `n` substrings. It can happen that some substrings are duplicate but since their ranks are not the same in `s` they are considered as different substrings.\n\nThe function returns the percentage formatted as a float with 10 decimals but the result is tested at 1e.-9 (see function assertFuzzy in the tests).\n\n#### Example:\nGiven string s = \"444996, 699990, 666690, 096904, 600644, 640646, 606469, 409694, 666094, 606490\"\ncomposing a set of n = 10 substrings (hence 45 combinations), `pos_average` returns `29.2592592593`.\n\nIn a set the `n` substrings will have the same length ( > 0 ).\n\n#### Notes\n- You can see other examples in the \"Sample tests\".\n",
