The shock absorbers are gone and you think it can handle about 15 more bumps before it dies totally.\n\nUnfortunately for you, your drive is very bumpy! Given a string showing either flat road (`_`) or bumps (`n`). If you are able to reach home safely by encountering `15 bumps or less`, return `Woohoo!`, otherwise return `Car Dead`",
