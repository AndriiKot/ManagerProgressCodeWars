  "description": "You have stumbled across the divine pleasure that is owning a dog and a garden. Now time to pick up all the cr@p! :D\n\nGiven a 2D array to represent your garden, you must find and collect all of the dog cr@p - represented by `'@'`.\n\nYou will also be given the number of bags you have access to (`bags`), and the capactity of a bag (`cap`). If there are no `bags` then you can't pick anything up, so you can ignore `cap`.\n\nYou need to find out if you have enough capacity to collect all the cr@p and make your garden clean again. \n\nIf you do, return `'Clean'`, else return `'Cr@p'`.\n\nWatch out though - if your dog is out there (`'D'`), he gets very touchy about being watched. If he is there you need to return `'Dog!!'`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nbags = 2\ncap = 2\nx (or garden) =\n[[ _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ ],\n [ _ , _ , _ , _ , @ , _ ],\n [ @ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ ]]\n```\n\nreturns `'Clean'`\n",
