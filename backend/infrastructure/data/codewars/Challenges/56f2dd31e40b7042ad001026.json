  "description": "In computing, there are two primary byte order formats: big-endian and little-endian. Big-endian is used primarily for networking (e.g., IP addresses are transmitted in big-endian) whereas little-endian is used mainly by computers with microprocessors.\n\nHere is an example (using 32-bit integers in hex format):\n\nLittle-Endian: 00 6D F4 C9 = 7,206,089\n\nBig-Endian:    C9 F4 6D 00 = 3,388,239,104\n\nYour job is to write a function that switches the byte order of a given integer. The function should take an integer n for the first argument, and the bit-size of the integer for the second argument. The bit size must be a power of 2 greater than or equal to 8. Your function should return a None value if the integer is negative, if the specified bit size is not a power of 2 that is 8 or larger, or if the integer is larger than the specified bit size can handle. In this kata, assume that all integers are unsigned (non-negative) and that all input arguments are integers (no floats, strings, None/nil values, etc.). Remember that you will need to account for padding of null (00) bytes.\n\nHint: bitwise operators are very helpful! :)",
