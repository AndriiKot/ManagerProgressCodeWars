  "description": "In this kata we want to convert a string into an integer. The strings simply represent the numbers in words.\n\nExamples:\n\n* \"one\" => 1\n* \"twenty\" => 20\n* \"two hundred forty-six\" => 246\n* \"seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen\" => 783919\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n* The minimum number is \"zero\" (inclusively)\n* The maximum number, which must be supported is 1 million (inclusively)\n* The \"and\" in e.g. \"one hundred and twenty-four\" is optional, in some cases it's present and in others it's not\n* All tested numbers are valid, you don't need to validate them",
