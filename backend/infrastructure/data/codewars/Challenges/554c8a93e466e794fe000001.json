  "description": "# Task\n\nYour task is to determine the relationship between the given point and the vector. Direction of the vector is important! To determine if the point is to the left or to the right, you should imagine yourself standing at the beginning of the vector and looking at the end of the vector.\n\n# Arguments\nYou are given coordinates of a point and coordinates of a vector on 2D plane:\n\n`point = [x, y]`\n\n`vector = [[x, y], [x, y]]` (two points, direction is from first to second)\n\nVectors always have non-zero length, so you don't have to check for that at this point.\n\n# Return\nYour function must return:\n\n`-1` if the point is to the left of the vector,\n\n`0` if the point is on the same line as vector,\n\n`1` if the point is to the right of the vector.\n\n# Do not repeat yourself!\nYou can consider re-using solution of this kata in some of the next Geometry katas:\n\n* [Geometry A-1.1: Similar kata with precision handling and a check for zero vectors](http://www.codewars.com/kata/geometry-a-1-dot-1-modify-point-location-detector-to-handle-zero-length-vectors-and-precision-errors-dry)\n* [Geometry A-3: Checking if point belongs to the vector](http://www.codewars.com/kata/geometry-a-3-does-point-belong-to-the-vector-dry)\n* [Geometry B-1: Is point inside or outside a triangle?](http://www.codewars.com/kata/geometry-b-1-point-in-a-triangle)",
