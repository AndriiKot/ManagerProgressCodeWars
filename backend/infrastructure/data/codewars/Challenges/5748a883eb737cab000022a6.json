  "description": "Ahoy Matey!\n\nWelcome to the seven seas.\n\nYou are the captain of a pirate ship.\n\nYou are in battle against the royal navy.\n\nYou have cannons at the ready.... or are they?\n\nYour task is to check if the gunners are loaded and ready, if they are: ```Fire!```\n\nIf they aren't ready: ```Shiver me timbers!```\n\nYour gunners for each test case are 2, 3 or 4.\n\nWhen you check if they are ready their answers are in a dictionary and will either be: ```aye``` or ```nay```\n\nFiring with less than all gunners ready is non-optimum (this is not fire at will, this is fire by the captain's orders or walk the plank, dirty sea-dog!)\n\nIf all answers are 'aye' then Fire!\nif one or more are 'nay' then Shiver me timbers!\n\nAlso, check out the new Pirates!!
