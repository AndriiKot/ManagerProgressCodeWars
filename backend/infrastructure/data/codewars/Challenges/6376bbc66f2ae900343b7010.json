  "description": "You just started working at a local cinema, and your first task is to write a function that returns the **showtimes of a specific movie**, given its **length**. In order to make your job easier, you will work with **24-hour format** throughout this kata.\n\nYour function receives three parameters, all of them being **integers**:\n\n- `open` - Hour at which the cinema opens.\n- `close` - Hour at which the cinema closes.\n- `length` - Length of the movie, in minutes.\n\nIt must return an array of times, with each time being in the format `(hour, minute)`. For example, `(19, 30)` means 19:30, and `(2, 0)` means 02:00. **The last session in the array cannot end after the cinema closes.** Also, the times in the array must be sorted from earliest to latest.\n\nThere's also a **15-minute window** between a session's end and the beginning of the following one, in order to give enough time for users to take a seat.\n\nFor example, for a cinema opening at **13:00** and closing at **23:00** showing a **60-minute** movie, your function must return the following array:\n\n```\n>>> movie_times(13, 23, 60)\n[(13, 0), (14, 15), (15, 30), (16, 45), (18, 0), (19, 15), (20, 30), (21, 45)]\n```\n\nNote that the cinema might close at times such as **02:00** or **03:00**, meaning examples like this must also work:\n\n```\n>>> movie_times(16, 3, 75)\n[(16, 0), (17, 30), (19, 0), (20, 30), (22, 0), (23, 30), (1, 0)]\n```\n\n***IMPORTANT:*** For languages other than Python, **just return an array of arrays.** See sample test cases for more info on how to return the list of times.\n\n***NOTE:** This kata isn't meant to be too challenging, so opening times for all tests will be **12:00** or later, and closing times will always be **6:00** or earlier.*\n\n***NOTE 2:** Midnight will be represented as (0, 0) or 0:00 in this kata, instead of 24:00.*\n\nGood luck!",
