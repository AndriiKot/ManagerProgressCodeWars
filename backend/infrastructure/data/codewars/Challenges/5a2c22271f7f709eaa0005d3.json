  "description": "You will be given a string and you task is to check if it is possible to convert that string into a palindrome by removing a single character. If the string is already a palindrome, return `\"OK\"`. If it is not, and we can convert it to a palindrome by removing one character, then return `\"remove one\"`, otherwise return `\"not possible\"`. The order of the characters should not be changed.\n\nFor example:\n```Haskell\nsolve(\"abba\") = \"OK\". -- This is a palindrome\nsolve(\"abbaa\") = \"remove one\". -- remove the 'a' at the extreme right. \nsolve(\"abbaab\") = \"not possible\". \n```\n\nMore examples in the test cases. \n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you like this Kata, please try [Single Character Palindromes II](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a66ea69e6be38219f000110)",
