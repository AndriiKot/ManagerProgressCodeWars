  "description": "Build Tower Advanced\n---\n\nBuild Tower by the following given arguments:<br>\n* __number of floors__ (integer and always greater than 0)<br>\n* __block size__ (width, height) (integer pair and always greater than (0, 0))\n\n***\nTower block unit is represented as `*`. Tower blocks of block size (2, 1) and (2, 3) would look like respectively:\n```\n  **\n```\n```\n  **\n  **\n  **\n```\n***\nfor example, a tower of 3 floors with block size = (2, 3) looks like below\n```\n[\n  '    **    ',\n  '    **    ',\n  '    **    ',\n  '  ******  ',\n  '  ******  ',\n  '  ******  ',\n  '**********',\n  '**********',\n  '**********'\n]\n```\nand a tower of 6 floors with block size = (2, 1) looks like below\n```\n[\n  '          **          ', \n  '        ******        ', \n  '      **********      ', \n  '    **************    ', \n  '  ******************  ', \n  '**********************'\n]\n```\n***\n\nDon't return a whole string containing line-endings but a list/array/vector of strings instead!\n\nThis kata might looks like a __5.5kyu__ one. So challenge yourself!\n\n\n\n\nGo take a look at [Build Tower](https://www.codewars.com/kata/576757b1df89ecf5bd00073b) which is a more basic version :)\n",
