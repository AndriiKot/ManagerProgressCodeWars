  "description": "# Task\n\nGiven a sequence of 0s and 1s, determine if it is a prefix of Thue-Morse sequence.\n\nThe infinite Thue-Morse sequence is obtained by first taking a sequence containing a single 0 and then repeatedly concatenating the current sequence with its binary complement.\n\nA binary complement of a sequence X is a sequence Y of the same length such that the sum of elements X_i and Y_i on the same positions is equal to 1 for each i.\n\nThus the first few iterations to obtain Thue-Morse sequence are:\n\n```\n0\n0 1\n0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1\n...\n```\n\n# Examples\n\nFor `seq=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1]`, the result should be `true`.\n\nFor `seq=[0, 1, 0, 0]`, the result should be `false`.\n\n# Inputs & Output\n\n- `[input]` integer array `seq`\n\nA non-empty array.\n\nConstraints:\n\n`1 <= seq.length <= 1000`\n\n`seq[i] ∈ [0,1]`\n\n- `[output]` a boolean value\n\n`true` if it is a prefix of Thue-Morse sequence. `false` otherwise.",
