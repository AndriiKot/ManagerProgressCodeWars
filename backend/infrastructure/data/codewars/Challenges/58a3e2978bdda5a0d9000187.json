  "description": "# Task\n Given two numbers `x` and `y`. You have to convert `x` to `y` using minimum number of operations.\n\n There are two valid operation on the number `x`:\n```\nMultiply x by some prime p\nDivide x by some prime p\n```\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of operations.\n\nNote that integer division is NOT allowed. That is, the result of `7 / 2` is 3.5, instead of 3.\n\n# Example\n\n For: `x = 2, y = 3`, the result should be `2`.\n \n `2 -> 2 * 3 -> 6 / 2 -> 3` in 2 moves.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` integer `x`\n\n  A decimal positive integer. `0 < x <= 10^12`\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `y`\n\n  A decimal positive integer. `0 < y <= 10^12`\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\n  The minimum number of operations",
