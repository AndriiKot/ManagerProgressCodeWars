  "description": "The code is a recursive attempt in calculating the result of a factorial function.  \nI.e. the result of 3! (Factorial of 3) is *3x2x1 = 6*.  \nIn case of 0! the result is 1 and in case of a negative factorial the result should be 0.\n\nThe goal is to find the bugs in the sourcecode and fix them (play a little pest control).",
