  "description": "The sum of `x` consecutive integers is `y`. What is the consecutive integer at position `n`? Given `x`, `y`, and `n`, solve for the integer. Assume the starting position is 0.\n\nFor example, if the sum of 4 consecutive integers is 14, what is the consecutive integer at position 3?\n\nWe find that the consecutive integers are `[2, 3, 4, 5]`, so the integer at position 3 is `5`.\n\n```python\nposition(4, 14, 3) == 5\n```\n\nAssume there will always be a sum of `x` consecutive integers that totals to `y` and `n` will never be indexed out of bounds.\n",
