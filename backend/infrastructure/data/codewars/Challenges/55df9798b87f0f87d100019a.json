  "description": "Think in all the primes that: if ```p```  is prime and  ```p < n``` , all these following numbers ``` (p + 2) ``` ,  ``` (p + h) ```  and  ```(p + 2h)```  are all primes, being  \t``` h \t```  an even number such that:  ``` 2 <= h <= hMax ``` \n\nYour function, ```give_max_h()``` , will receive 2 arguments  \t``` n \t```  and  \t```hMax``` .\n\nIt should find for which value or values of \t```  h \t``` , we encounter the maximum amount of primes that satisfy the above constraint, testing for all possible even values from  \t``` 2 to hMax \t```  included.\n\nSo,  ```give_max_h(n, hMax)```  should ouput a list of lists with the following structure:\na) if you find a unique solution:\n\n ``` [[h0, max amount of primes]]``` being  \t``` h0 \t```  such that ``` 2 <= h0 <= hMax```  and is the value that has the highest amount of collected primes\n\nb) if you have more than one solution, suposse  \t``` 2 \t``` , you found two values of h:  ```h0``` , ```h1 ```   such that :  ```2 <= ho < h1 <= hmax ``` \n\n```[[h0, max_amount_of_primes], [h1, max_amount_of_primes]]```  (lists should be sorted by the value of h)\nLet's see some cases:\nFor Python and Ruby:\n```\nCase 1\ngive_max_h(30, 8) ------> [[6, 3]]\n```\nFor Javascript:\n```\nCase 1\ngiveMax_h(30, 8) ------> [[6, 3]]\n```\n\nwe have 4 different sets of steps to test\n[2, 2, 4], [2, 4, 8], [2, 6, 12] and [2, 8, 16]\n\n///so that we select primes p in the range (2, 30) that fulfill:\n```p, p + 2, p + 2 and p + 4```  all primes --- > only with prime 3 (1 prime)\n\n```p, p + 2, p + 4 and  p + 8``` all primes ----> only with prime 3 (1 prime)\n\n```p, p + 2, p + 6 and p + 12``` all primes -----> passed by primes 5, 11, 17 (3 primes)\n\n```p, p + 2, p + 8 and p + 16``` all primes -----> only with prime 3 (1 prime)\n\nSo h is 6 with 3 found primes (max amount of primes) ([6, 3])///\n\n\nCase 2)\nFor Python and Ruby\n```\ngive_max_h(100, 10) -----> [[6, 4]] # with h = 6 we found the highest amount of primes (4) : 5, 11, 17, 41\n```\nFor Javascript\n```\ngiveMax_h(100, 10) -----> [[6, 4]]\n```\nCase 3)\nFor Python and Ruby\n```\ngive_max_h(1000, 100) -----> [[30, 13], [42, 13]] # we have two values of h that #procuded the highest amount of primes (13)\n```\nFor Javascript\n```\ngiveMax_h(1000, 100) -----> [[30, 13], [42, 13]]\n```\n```\n///h = 30 produced the primes 11, 29, 41, 71, 107, 137, 197, 419, 431, 461, 617, 827, 881\nh = 42 produced the primes 5, 17, 29, 107, 149, 197, 227, 269, 347, 419, 599, 617, 659\n///\n```\nHappy coding!!\n\n(Advise: You will need a fast prime generator. Do not use primality tests, otherwise the runtimes would exceed our allowed 6000 ms to complete tests)\n\n(To investigate beyond this kata: Do we have a convergence for the value of h, no matter the values of n and hMax are?)\n \n\n",
