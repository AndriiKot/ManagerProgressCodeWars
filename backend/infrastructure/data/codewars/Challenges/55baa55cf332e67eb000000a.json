  "description": "Lexicographic permutations are ordered combinations of a set of items ordered in a specific way.\n\nFor instance, the first 8 permutations of the digits 0123, in lexicographic order, are:\n\n```\n1st 0123\n2nd 0132\n3rd 0213\n4th 0231\n5th 0312\n6th 0321\n7th 1023\n8th 1032\n```\n\nYour task is to write a function ```L( n, d )``` that will return a `string` representing the `nth` permutation of the `d` digit, starting with 0 (i.e. d=10 means all digits 0123456789).\n\nSo for `d = 4`, `L(7,4)` should return `'1023'`, and `L(4,4)` should return `'0231'`\n.\n\n\nSome things to bear in mind:\n\n• The function should return a `string`, otherwise permutations beginning with a 0 will have it removed. \n\n• Test cases will not exceed the highest possible valid values for `n`\n\n• The function should work for any `d` between `1` and `10`.\n\n• A value of 1 for `n` means the 1st permutation, so `n = 0` is not a valid input.\n\n• Oh, and no itertools ;)",
