  "description": "# Story\n\nIt is the Chinese New Year Eve. You are at your Chinese friend's house.\n\nWhen he says: \"It is one hour left.\"\n\nYou look at your watch, it is `22:00`.\n\nSo you ask him, here is the reason.\n\n___\n\n# Using Earthly Branches for Time\n\nIn the traditional system using [Earthly Branches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthly_Branches), a day is started by `23:00`.\n\nEarthly Branches contain `12` characters:\n\n```\n子 丑 寅 卯 辰 巳 午 未 申 酉 戌 亥\n```\n\nNot only [for the years](https://www.codewars.com/kata/62cc917fedc75c95ef961ad1), it also can be used for the time.\n\nThe day starts with `子`, 2 hours later become `丑`, then `寅`, and so on.\n\n* `子`: 23:00 - 0:59\n\n* `丑`:  1:00 - 2:59\n\n* `寅`:  3:00 - 4:59\n\nand so on.\n\n___\n\n# Task:\n\nGiven a time as a string(`hh:mm`), return the `Earthly Branch` for that time.\n\nThe string would use 24-hours. It may have leading zero for `minute`, but no leading zero for `hour`.\n___\n\n# Examples (input -> output)\n\n```\n23:00 -> 子\n 0:00 -> 子\n 1:00 -> 丑\n 2:59 -> 丑\n 3:00 -> 寅\n```\n___\n\nNote: The system called `時辰/时辰` in Chinese, but I found that google translation and the name wikipedia used in Earthly Branch are different, so just ignore the English name for it...",
