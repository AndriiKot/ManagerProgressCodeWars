  "description": "Mutation is a genetic operator used to maintain genetic diversity from one generation of a population of genetic algorithm chromosomes to the next.\n\n![Mutation](http://i.imgur.com/HngmxNN.gif)\n\nA mutation here may happen on zero or more positions in a chromosome. It is going to check every position and by a given probability it will decide if a mutation will occur.\n\nA mutation is the change from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`.\n\n***Note:*** *Some tests are random. If you think your algorithm is correct but the result fails, trying again should work.*\n\n# See other katas from this series\n\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #1 Generate](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-1-generate)\n  - **Genetic Algorithm Series - #2 Mutation**\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #3 Crossover](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-3-crossover)\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #4 Get population and fitnesses](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-4-get-population-and-fitnesses)\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #5 Roulette wheel selection](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-5-roulette-wheel-selection)",
