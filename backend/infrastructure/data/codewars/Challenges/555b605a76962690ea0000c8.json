  "description": "Every positive integer can be written as a sum of [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). For example `10 = 8 + 2` _or_ `5 + 3 + 2` _or_ `3 + 3 + 2 + 2`. Apparently, this representation is not unique.\n\nIt becomes unique, if we rule out *consecutive* Fibonacci numbers: this is [Zeckendorf's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeckendorf%27s_theorem), first proven by Lekkerkerker in 1952. In the example above, this excludes the last two representations (containing the consecutive Fibonacci numbers `2` and `3`), and we are left with the *Zeckendorf representation* `10 = 8 + 2`.\n\nComplete the function that returns the Zeckendorf representation of a given integer `n` as a list of Fibonacci numbers in decreasing order. Return an empty list for `n = 0` and `None/nil` for negative `n`.\n\n_Hint: Be greedy!_\n\n---\n\nFootnote: The Zeckendorf representation is closely connected to the Fibonacci coding.",
