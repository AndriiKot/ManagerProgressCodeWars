  "description": "Write an algorithm that takes a list and moves all of the zeroes to the end, preserving the order of all zero and all non-zero elements.\n\nZeroes can be any `Num` instance ( `0` ) :\n\n```haskell\nmoveZeros [1,2,0,1,0,1,0,3,0,1] -> [1,2,1,1,3,1,0,0,0,0]\n```\n\nor any `MonadPlus` instance ( `mzero` ) :\n\n```haskell\nmoveZeros [ Nothing, Just 0, Just 1 ] -> [ Just 0, Just 1, Nothing ]\n```\n\nWhere instances of both `Num` and `MonadPlus` exist, move the zeroes from the `Num` instance.\n\nInspired by [@xcthulhu](https://www.codewars.com/users/xcthulhu/)'s kata [Moving Zeros To The End](https://www.codewars.com/kata/moving-zeros-to-the-end/).\n\nMany, many thanks to [@Unnamed](https://www.codewars.com/users/Unnamed/).",
