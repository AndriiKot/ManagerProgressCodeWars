  "description": "Wouldn't it be cool to be able to spell your numbers verbally, in digit-by-digit fashion? Instead of boring `731` you could write fancy `Num.seven.three.one`!\n\nImplement a class that allows chaining methods `zero`, `one`, `two`, `three`, `four`, `five`, `six`, `seven`, `eight`, `nine` to construct numbers in a similar manner.\n\n**Note**: your class should also support a method which converts its instances into integers (provided in the initial solution).",
