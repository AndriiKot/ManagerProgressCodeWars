  "description": "An array of integers is defined to be *odd-heavy* if it contains at least one odd element and every odd number in it is greater than any even number in it.\n\nWrite a function that accepts an integer array and returns whether the array is odd-heavy.\n\n### Examples\n\n```\nArray [11,4,9,2,8] is odd-heavy,\nbecause its odd elements [11,9] are greater than all the even elements [4,2,8]\n\nArray [11,4,9,2,3,10] is not odd-heavy,\nbecause one of its even elements (10 from [4,2,10]) is greater than two of\nits odd elements (9 and 3 from [11,9,3])\n\nArray [] is not odd-heavy,\nbecause it does not contain any odd numbers\n\nArray [3] is odd-heavy,\nbecause it does not contain any even numbers.\n```",
