  "description": "⚠️ The world is in quarantine! There is a new pandemia that struggles mankind. Each continent is isolated from each other but infected people have spread before the warning. ⚠️\n\n🗺️ You would be given a map of the world in a type of string:\n\n    string s = \"01000000X000X011X0X\"\n\n    '0' : uninfected\n\n    '1' : infected\n\n    'X' : ocean\n\n⚫ The virus can't spread in the other side of the ocean.\n\n⚫ If one person is infected every person in this continent gets infected too.\n\n⚫ Your task is to find the percentage of human population that got infected in the end.\n\n☑️ Return the percentage % of the total population that got infected.\n\n❗❗ The first and the last continent are not connected!\n\n💡 Example:\n\n     start: map1 = \"01000000X000X011X0X\"\n     end:   map1 = \"11111111X000X111X0X\"\n     total = 15\n     infected = 11\n     percentage = 100*11/15 = 73.33333333333333\n\n➕ For maps without oceans \"X\" the whole world is connected.\n\n➕ For maps without \"0\" and \"1\" return 0 as there is no population.",
