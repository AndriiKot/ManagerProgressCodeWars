  "description": "It seems as though the infamous soundcloud rapper \"6ix 9ine\" has been locked away for good. As sad as this may be, his name will surely live on...\n\n***\n\nWrite a function that takes a string representing a date-of-birth as an argument (\"dd.mm.yy\") and returns a string containing the generated Rap-Name.\n\nHow to figure out one's Rap-Name:\n* Find the average of the two digits that make up the DAY of birth. (\"DD.mm.yy\")\n* Find the average of the two digits that make up the YEAR of birth. (\"dd.mm.YY\")\n* Note: only integers are admissible, therefore round up averages that are decimal\n* Note: if the average of the YEAR of birth is 0 (in the case of \"dd.mm.00\"), the format is ```'0ero'```\n* Return a single string containing both numbers represented in the following _format_ - e.g, ``` '3hree 6ix' ```\n* _format_ = the respective number replaces the first character for the word of said number. ``` 'three' ``` becomes ``` '3hree' ```\n\n \n\n\n\n",
