  "description": "Some numbers can be expressed as a difference of two squares, for example, <code>20 = 6<sup>2</sup>-4<sup>2</sup></code> and <code>21 = 5<sup>2</sup>-2<sup>2</sup></code>. Many numbers can be written this way, but not all.\n\n## Your Task\nComplete the function that takes a positive integer `n` and returns the amount of numbers between `1` and `n` (inclusive) that can be represented as the difference of two perfect squares.\n\n**Note**: Your code should be able to handle `n` values up to 45000\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nn = 4 ==> 3\nn = 5 ==> 4\nn = 10 ==> 7\nn = 20 ==> 15\nn = 6427 ==> 4820\n```",
