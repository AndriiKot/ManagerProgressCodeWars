  "description": "In cryptanalysis, words patterns can be a useful tool in cracking simple ciphers.\n\nA word pattern is a description of the patterns of letters occurring in a word, where\neach letter is given an integer code in order of appearance. So the first letter is\ngiven the code 0, and second is then assigned 1 if it is different to the first letter\nor 0 otherwise, and so on.\n\nAs an example, the word \"hello\" would become \"0.1.2.2.3\". For this task case-sensitivity\nis ignored, so \"hello\", \"helLo\" and \"heLlo\" will all return the same word pattern.\n\nYour task is to return the word pattern for a given word. All words provided will\nbe non-empty strings of alphabetic characters only, i.e. matching the regex \"[a-zA-Z]+\".",
