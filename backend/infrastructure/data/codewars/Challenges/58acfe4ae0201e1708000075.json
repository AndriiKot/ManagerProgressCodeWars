  "description": "### Task\n King Arthur and his knights are having a New Years party. Last year Lancelot was jealous of Arthur, because Arthur had a date and Lancelot did not, and they started a duel.\n\n To prevent this from happening again, Arthur wants to make sure that there are at least as many women as men at this year's party. He gave you a list of integers of all the party goers. \n \n Arthur needs you to return true if he needs to invite more women or false if he is all set.\n\n### Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer array `L` (`$a` in PHP)\n\n  An array (guaranteed non-associative in PHP) representing the genders of the attendees, where `-1` represents `women` and `1` represents `men`.\n  \n  `2 <= L.length <= 50`\n  \n\n- `[output]` a boolean value\n\n  `true` if Arthur need to invite more women, `false` otherwise.",
