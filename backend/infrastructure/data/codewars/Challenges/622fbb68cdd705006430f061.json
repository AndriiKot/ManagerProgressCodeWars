  "description": "<h2>Backstory</h2>\nA surgeon performed an operation on one of his patients by operating a mechanical machine through software, the software and hardware had many issues, of which most were reported to the hospital, but no one bothered to repair the machine. The most critical of these errors costed the surgeon his job. So, he decided to build a time machine and travel back in time to correct his mistakes and collect valuable information to show the hospital that they should take this matter more seriously.\n<br>\n<h2>Problem</h2>\nGiven a 3D array which contains <code>origin points (x, y) and their radii (int)</code> and a 2D array of stutters (2D points of mistakes) <code>points (x, y)</code> you need to calculate how much pressure (i.e., the distance) the surgeon would need to apply to bring back the machine to fall on or within the radii of the given points.\nThe last element in the returning array should be the (floor) average of the x and y deviation from the radius.\n<br>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<code>Origin (30, 2), Radius (3), Actual (40, -14)</code>.<br>\nThe point <code>(40, -14)</code> does not fall within the given radius <code>3</code> of the point <code>(30, 2)</code>.<br>So an answer in this case could be <code>(-8, 16)</code>, with an average deviation of <code>y: (40 - (30 + 3) / 1), x: (14 - (2 + 3)) / 1)</code>.",
