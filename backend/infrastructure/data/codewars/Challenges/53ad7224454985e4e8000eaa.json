  "description": "The dragon's curve is a self-similar fractal which can be obtained by a recursive method. \n\nStarting with the string `D0 = 'Fa'`, at each step simultaneously perform the following operations:\n\n```\nreplace 'a' with: 'aRbFR'\nreplace 'b' with: 'LFaLb'\n```\n\nFor example (spaces added for more visibility) : \n\n```\n1st iteration: Fa -> F aRbF R\n2nd iteration: FaRbFR -> F aRbFR R LFaLb FR\n```\n\nAfter `n` iteration, remove `'a'` and `'b'`. You will have a string with `'R'`,`'L'`, and `'F'`. This is a set of instruction. Starting at the origin of a grid looking in the `(0,1)` direction, `'F'` means a step forward, `'L'` and `'R'` mean respectively turn left and right. After executing all instructions, the trajectory will give a beautifull self-replicating pattern called 'Dragon Curve'\n\nThe goal of this kata is to code a function wich takes one parameter `n`, the number of iterations needed and return the string of instruction as defined above. For example: \n\n```\nn=0, should return: 'F'\nn=1, should return: 'FRFR'\nn=2, should return: 'FRFRRLFLFR'\n```\n\n`n` should be a number and non-negative integer. All other case should return the empty string: `''`. \n\n",
