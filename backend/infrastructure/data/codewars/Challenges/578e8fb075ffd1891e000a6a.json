  "description": "In this kata you'll be given a value expressed in milliseconds. Your job is to convert this value to a nicely readable format like this \"hh:mm:ss\".\n\n**Some basic rules:**\n\n- Your answer should be returned as a string\n- Don't use any leading zeros before your string, e.g.\n\n```\n\"1:00:00\" // is correct;\n\n\"1:00\" // is correct;\n\n\"01:00\" // is not correct;\n```\n\n- Always show the number of minutes and seconds, but don't show the hours if less than one hour\n\n```\n\"0:59:00\" // is not correct;\n\n\"59:00\" // is correct;\n```\n\n- Always round down to the nearest whole second\n- If the value is less than 1 hour, don't show the hours at all\n- The highest possible value will be 86,400,000 milliseconds, i.e. 24 hours\n",
