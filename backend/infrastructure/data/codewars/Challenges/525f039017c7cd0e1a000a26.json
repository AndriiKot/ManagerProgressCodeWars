  "description": "Number is a palindrome if it is equal to the number with digits in reversed order.\nFor example, `5`, `44`, `171`, `4884` are palindromes, and `43`, `194`, `4773` are not.\n\nWrite a function which takes a positive integer and returns the number of special steps needed to obtain a palindrome. The special step is: \"reverse the digits, and add to the original number\". If the resulting number is not a palindrome, repeat the procedure with the sum until the resulting number is a palindrome.\n\nIf the input number is already a palindrome, the number of steps is `0`.\n\n~~~if:java\nAll inputs are guaranteed to have a final palindrome which does not overflow `long`.\n~~~\n~~~if:javascript\nAll inputs are guaranteed to have a final palindrome which does not overflow `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.\n~~~\n~~~if:python\nAll inputs are guaranteed to have a final palindrome smaller than `$ 2^63 $`.\n~~~\n~~~if:pascal\nAll inputs are guaranteed to have a final palindrome which does not overflow `integer`.\n~~~\n\n\n### Example\n\nFor example, start with `87`:\n\n```\n  87 +   78 =  165     - step 1, not a palindrome\n 165 +  561 =  726     - step 2, not a palindrome\n 726 +  627 = 1353     - step 3, not a palindrome\n1353 + 3531 = 4884     - step 4, palindrome!\n```\n\n`4884` is a palindrome and we needed `4` steps to obtain it, so answer for `87` is `4`.\n\n### Additional info\n\nSome interesting information on the problem can be found in this Wikipedia article on [Lychrel numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number).",
