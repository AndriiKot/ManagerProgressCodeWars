  "description": "# 7 Wonders\n[7 Wonders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Wonders_(board_game)) is a board game that consists of building your city, gathering resources and fighting your neighbors.\n\nOne part of the game is also to research science in order to gain points at the end of the game.\nThere are 3 types of science glyphs you can gather:\n+ Compasses\n+ Gears\n+ Tablets\n\nThe way points are added up works as described here:\n\n\n### Step 1\n\nEach **distinct set of three different glyphs** is worth 7 points:\n\n```\n1 Compass, 1 Gear and 1 Tablet    =  7 points\n2 Compasses, 1 Gear and 1 Tablet  =  7 points (because it's just one disctinct set)\n```\n\nNote that a **distinct set of three different glyphs** means 1 Compass, 1 Gear and 1 Tablet. No more, no less!\n\n\n### Step 2\n\nThe amount of each glyph you own is **squared** and then **summed up**:\n```\n1 Compass, 1 Gear and 1 Tablet    =  1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1  =  3 points\n2 Compasses, 1 Gear and 1 Tablet  =  2*2 + 1*1 + 1*1  =  6 points\n```\n\n\n### Finally\n\nThe total science points is equal to the sum of the two steps:\n```\n1 Compass, 1 Gear and 1 Tablet    =  7 + 3  =  10 points\n2 Compasses, 1 Gear and 1 Tablet  =  7 + 6  =  13 points\n```\n\nYou will be given 3 inputs corresponding to the amount of each glyph you have acquired in the game. Your task is to output the final score.\nTake into account that you may have no glyphs at all!\n",
