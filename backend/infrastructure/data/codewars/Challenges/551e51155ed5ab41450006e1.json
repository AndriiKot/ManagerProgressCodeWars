  "description": "Write a function which sums the result of the sums of the elements specified in `table` multiplied by all the numbers in between `min` and `max` including themselves.\n\nFor example, for `table=[2,5], min=1, max=3` the result should be the same as\n```\n2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 +\n5*1 + 5*2 + 5*3\n```\ni.e. the table of two from 1 to 3 plus the table of five from 1 to 3\n\nAll the numbers are integers but you must take in account:\n\n* `table` could be empty.\n* `min` could be negative.\n* `max` could be really big.\n* It is guaranteed that the input `min` <= `max`",
