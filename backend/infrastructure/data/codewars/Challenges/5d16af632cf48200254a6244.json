  "description": "A strongness of an even number is the number of times we can successively divide by 2 until we reach an odd number starting with an even number n.\n\nFor example, if n = 12, then\n* 12 / 2 = 6\n* 6 / 2 = 3\n\nSo we divided successively 2 times and we reached 3, so the strongness of 12 is `2`.\n\nIf n = 16 then\n* 16 / 2 = 8\n* 8 / 2 = 4\n* 4 / 2 = 2\n* 2 / 2 = 1\n\nwe divided successively 4 times and we reached 1, so the strongness of 16 is `4`\n\n\n# Task\n\nGiven a closed interval `[n, m]`, return the even number that is the strongest in the interval. If multiple solutions exist return the smallest strongest even number.\n\nNote that programs must run within the allotted server time; a naive solution will probably time out.\n\n\n# Constraints\n```if-not:ruby\n1 <= n < m <= INT_MAX\n```\n```if:ruby\n1 <= n < m <= 2^64\n```\n\n\n# Examples\n```\n[1, 2]    -->   2  # 1 has strongness 0, 2 has strongness 1\n[5, 10]   -->   8  # 5, 7, 9 have strongness 0; 6, 10 have strongness 1; 8 has strongness 3\n[48, 56]  -->  48\n",
