  "description": "Imagine a triangle of numbers which follows this pattern:\n\n * Starting with the number \"1\", \"1\" is positioned at the top of the triangle. As this is the 1st row, it can only support a single number.\n * The 2nd row can support the next 2 numbers: \"2\" and \"3\"\n * Likewise, the 3rd row, can only support the next 3 numbers: \"4\", \"5\", \"6\"\n * And so on; this pattern continues.\n\n```\n    1\n   2 3\n  4 5 6\n 7 8 9 10\n...\n```\n\nGiven N, return the sum of all numbers on the Nth Row:\n\n1 <= N <= 10,000\n\n",
