  "description": "It is 2050 and romance has long gone, relationships exist solely for practicality.\n\nMatchMyHusband is a website that matches busy working women with perfect house husbands. You have been employed by MatchMyHusband to write a function that determines who matches!!\n\nThe rules are... a match occurs providing the husband's \"usefulness\" rating is greater than or equal to the woman's \"needs\".\n\nThe husband's \"usefulness\" is the <strong>SUM</strong> of his cooking, cleaning and childcare abilities and takes the form of an<strong> array </strong>.\n\nusefulness example --> [15, 26, 19] &nbsp;  (15 + 26 + 19) = 60\n\nEvery woman that signs up, begins with a \"needs\" rating of <strong>100</strong>. However, it's realised that the longer women wait for their husbands, the more dissatisfied they become with our service. They also become less picky, therefore their needs are subject to exponential decay of 15% per month. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay\n\nGiven the number of months since sign up, write a function that returns \"Match!\" if the husband is useful enough, or \"No match!\" if he's not.\n",
