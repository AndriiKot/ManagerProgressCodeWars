  "description": "You just got done writing a function that calculates the player's final score for your new game, \"Flight of the <a href = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Cacatua_moluccensis_excited.jpg/1280px-Cacatua_moluccensis_excited.jpg'>cockatoo</a>\".\n\nNow all you need is a high score table that can be updated with the player's final scores. With such a feature, the player will be motivated to try to beat his previous scores, and hopefully, never stop playing your game.\n\nThe high score table will start out empty. A limit to the size of the table will be specified upon creation of the table.\n\n<strong>Here's an example of the expected behavior of the high score table :</strong>\n\n```python\nhighScoreTable = HighScoreTable(3)\nhighScoreTable.scores == [] # evaluates to True\nhighScoreTable.update(10)\nhighScoreTable.scores == [10]\nhighScoreTable.update(8)\nhighScoreTable.update(12)\nhighScoreTable.update(5)\nhighScoreTable.update(10)\nhighScoreTable.scores == [12, 10, 10]\nhighScoreTable.reset()\nhighScoreTable.scores == []\n# And so on...\n```\n```coffeescript\nhighScoreTable = new HighScoreTable 3\nhighScoreTable.scores # => []\nhighScoreTable.update 10\nhighScoreTable.scores # => [10]\nhighScoreTable.update 8\nhighScoreTable.update 12\nhighScoreTable.update 5\nhighScoreTable.update 10\nhighScoreTable.scores # => [12, 10, 10]\nhighScoreTable.reset()\nhighScoreTable.scores # => []\n# And so on...\n```",
