  "description": "<h4>DevOps legacy roasting!</h4>\nSave the business from technological purgatory. \n\nConvert IT to DevOps, modernize application workloads, take it all to the Cloud…….\n\nYou will receive a string of workloads represented by words….some legacy and some modern mixed in with complaints from the business….your job is to burn the legacy in a disco inferno and count the value of each roasting and the number of complaints resolved. \n\nHere is a list of all complaints which need to be resolved:\n```\ncomplaints (in this format, case-insensitive) -> \"slow!\", \"expensive!\", \"manual!\", \"down!\", \"hostage!\", \"security!\"\n\n```\n\nThe value is based on real or perceived pain by the business and the expense of keeping it all running. \n\nPull the values from the list below...\n\n```\n1970s Disco Fever Architecture………\nSort of like a design from Saturday night Fever….\n\n            (  .      )\n                )           (              )\n                      .

Edsger Dijkstra\n\nFor more information on how to have a disco inferno\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_sY2rjxq6M\n\nDisclaimer - this should only be attempted by trained professionals and in accordance with local ordinances.
