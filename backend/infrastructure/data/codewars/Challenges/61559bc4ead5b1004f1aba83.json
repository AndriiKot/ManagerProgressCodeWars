  "description": "Your task is to return the amount of white rectangles in a `NxN` spiral. Your font may differ, if we talk of white rectangles, we talk about the symbols in the top row.\n\n\n#### Notes:\n* As a general rule, the white snake cannot touch itself.\n* The size will be at least 5.\n* The test cases get very large, it is not feasible to calculate the solution with a loop.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nFor example, a spiral with size 5 should look like this:\n\n⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜\\\n⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬜⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬛⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜\n\nAnd return the value 17 because the total amount of white rectangles is 17.\n\n---\n\nA spiral with the size 7 would look like this:\n\n⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜\\\n⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬛⬛⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬜⬜⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜\n\n\nAnd return the value 31 because the total amount of white rectangles is 31.\n\n---\n\nA spiral with the size 8 would look like this:\n\n⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜\\\n⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬜⬛⬛⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬜⬜⬜⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜\n\nAnd return the value 39 because the total amount of white rectangles is 39.\n\n---\n\nA spiral with the size 9 would look like this:\n\n⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜\\\n⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬜⬜⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬜⬛⬛⬛⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜\n\n\nAnd return the value 49 because the total amount of white rectangles is 49.\n\n---\n\nA spiral with the size 10 would look like this:\n\n⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜\\\n⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬜⬜⬜⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬜⬛⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬜\\\n⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜\n\nAnd return the value 59 because the total amount of white rectangles is 59.\n\n\n",
