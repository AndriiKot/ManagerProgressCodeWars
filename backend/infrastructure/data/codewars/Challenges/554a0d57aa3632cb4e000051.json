  "description": "Create a method, `Array#each_count`, which returns a count of discrete elements contained in the form of `{element => count}`.\n\nYour method should meet the following criteria:\n\n* When called without arguments or a block, it should iterate over each element of _self_, returning a count of its unique elements.\n\n* It should accept a method (in symbol or string format) followed by any number of arguments as parameters. It should apply these parameters to each element of _self_, returning a count of each unique return value.\n\n* It should accept a block, call the block on each element of _self_, and return a count of each unique return value.\n\n* It should raise an exception if both arguments and a block are provided.",
