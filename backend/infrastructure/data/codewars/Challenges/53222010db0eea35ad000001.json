  "description": "## Task\n\nYour challenge is to write a function named `getSlope`/`get_slope`/`GetSlope` that calculates the slope of the line through two points.\n\n## Input\n\n```if:javascript,python\nEach point that the function takes in is an array 2 elements long. The first number is the x coordinate and the second number is the y coordinate.\nIf the line through the two points is vertical or if the same point is given twice, the function should return `null`/`None`.\n```\n\n\n```if:c\nIn C, the function `get_slope` is passed two `point` structures, each consisting of two `double` coordinates: `x` and `y`.\n\ndouble get_slope(point a, point b, bool *is_slope);\n\nIf the line through the two points is vertical or if the same point is given twice, set the pointer `*is_slope` to `false`.\n```\n\n\n```if:csharp\n`GetSlope` will take in two Point objects. If the line through the two points is vertical, or the two points are the same, return `null`.\n\nThe Point object:\n\n~~~\npublic class Point : System.Object\n{\n  public double X;\n  public double Y;\n  \n  public Point(double x, double y)\n  {\n    this.X = x;\n    this.Y = y;\n  }\n  \n  public override string ToString()\n  {\n    return $\"({this.X}, {this.Y})\";\n  }\n  \n  public override bool Equals(object point)\n  {\n    // Typechecking\n    if (point == null || point.GetType() != this.GetType())\n    {\n      return false;\n    }\n    \n    return this.ToString() == point.ToString();\n  }\n}\n~~~\n\n\n\n```",
