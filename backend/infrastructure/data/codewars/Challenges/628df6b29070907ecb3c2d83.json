  "description": "A runner, who runs with base speed ```s``` with duration ```t``` will cover a distances ```d```: ```d = s * t```<br>\nHowever, this runner can sprint for one unit of time with double speed ```s * 2```<br>\nAfter sprinting, base speed ```s``` will permanently reduced by ```1```, and for next one unit of time runner will enter recovery phase and can't sprint again.\n \nYour task, given base speed ```s``` and time ```t```, is to find the maximum possible distance ```d```.\n\n## Input:\n```1 <= s < 1000```<br>\n```1 <= t < 1000```\n\n## Example:\nGiven ```s = 2``` and ```t = 4```.<br>\nWe could schedule when runner should sprint so we could get these possible sequences:<br>\n<pre>\nSeq.: RRRR\n=> s + s + s + s\n=> 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8\nSeq.: RRRS\n=> s + s + s + s*2\n=> 2 + 2 + 2 + 2*2 = 10\nSeq.: RRSR\n=> s + s + s*2 + (s-1)\n=> 2 + 2 + 2*2 + (2-1) = 9\nSeq.: RSRR\n=> s + s*2 + (s-1) + (s-1)\n=> 2 + 2*2 + (2-1) + (2-1) = 8\nSeq.: RSRS\n=> s + s*2 + (s-1) + (s-1)*2\n=> 2 + 2*2 + (2-1) + (2-1)*2 = 9\nSeq.: SRRR\n=> s*2 + (s-1) + (s-1) + (s-1)\n=> 2*2 + (2-1) + (2-1) + (2-1) = 7\nSeq.: SRRS\n=> s*2 + (s-1) + (s-1) + (s-1)*2\n=> 2*2 + (2-1) + (2-1) + (2-1)*2 = 8\nSeq.: SRSR\n=> s*2 + (s-1) + (s-1)*2 + (s-1-1)\n=> 2*2 + (2-1) + (2-1)*2 + (2-1-1) = 7\n\nWhere:\n- R: Normal Run / Recovery\n- S: Sprint\n</pre>\nBased on above sequences, the maximum possible distance ```d``` is ```10```.\n\n<p style=\"font-size: larger; text-align: center;\"><b>Enjoy!</b></p>",
