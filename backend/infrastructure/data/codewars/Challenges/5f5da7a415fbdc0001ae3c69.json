  "description": "# Right in the Center\n\n_This is inspired by one of Nick Parlante's exercises on the [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java) online code practice tool._\n\nGiven a sequence of characters, does `\"abc\"` appear in the CENTER of the sequence?\n\nThe sequence of characters could contain more than one `\"abc\"`.\n\nTo define CENTER, the number of characters in the sequence to the left and right of the \"abc\" (which is in the middle) must differ by at most one.\n\nIf it is in the CENTER, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.\n\nWrite a function as the solution for this problem. This kata looks simple, but it might not be easy.\n\n## Example\n\n    is_in_middle(\"AAabcBB\")  ->  True\n    is_in_middle(\"AabcBB\")   ->  True\n    is_in_middle(\"AabcBBB\")  ->  False",
