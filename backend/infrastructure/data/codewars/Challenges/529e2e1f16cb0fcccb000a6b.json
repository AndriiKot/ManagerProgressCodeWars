  "description": "We need the ability to divide an unknown integer into a given number of even parts - or at least as even as they can be. The sum of the parts should be the original value, but each part should be an integer, and they should be as close as possible.\n\nComplete the function so that it returns an array of integers representing the parts. If the input number is too small to split it into requested amount of parts, the additional parts should have value 0. Ignoring the order of the parts, there is only one valid solution for each input to your function!\n\n### Example:\n\n```text\n20 split into 6 parts should return [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], in any order.\n```\n```c\nsplit_integer(20, 6, *parts)  // fills parts with 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4\n```\n```python\nsplit_integer(20, 6)  # returns [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]\n```\n```ruby\nsplitInteger(20, 6)   # returns [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]\n```\n```javascript\nsplitInteger(20, 6)  // returns [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]\n```\n```haskell\nsplitInteger 20 6    -- returns [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]\n```\n```scala\nsplitInteger(20, 6)  // returns Seq(3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4)\n```\n\n\n### Inputs\n\n~~~if:c,cpp,crystal,julia,php\n\n```math\n0 \\leqslant num \\leqslant 1\\,000\\,000\\,000  \\\\\n1 \\leqslant parts \\leqslant 1000\n```\n~~~\n\n~~~if-not:c,cpp,crystal,julia,php\nThe input to your function will always be valid for this kata.\n~~~\n",
