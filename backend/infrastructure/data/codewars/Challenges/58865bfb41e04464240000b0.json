  "description": "Variation of [this nice kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/bits-battle/), the war has expanded and become dirtier and meaner; both even and odd numbers will fight with their pointy `1`s.\nAnd negative integers are coming into play as well, with, ça va sans dire, a negative contribution (think of them as spies or saboteurs).\n\nA number's strength is determined by the number of set bits (`1`s) in its binary representation. Negative integers work against their own side so their strength is negative.\nFor example `-5` = `-101` has strength `-2` and `+5` = `+101` has strength `+2`.\n\nThe side with the largest cumulated strength wins.\n\nAgain, three possible outcomes: `odds win`, `evens win` and `tie`.\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\n[1,5,12]    => \"odds win\"  //   1 + 101 vs 1100,         3 vs 2\n[7,-3,20]   => \"evens win\" // 111 - 11  vs 10100,    3 - 2 vs 2\n[7,-3,-2,6] => \"tie\"       // 111 - 11  vs -1 + 110,  3 - 2 vs -1 + 2\n```",
