  "description": "Sherlock has to find suspects on his latest case. He will use your method, dear Watson. Suspect in this case is a person which has something not allowed in his/her pockets.\n\nAllowed items are defined by array of numbers.\n\nPockets contents are defined by map entries where key is a person and value is one or few things represented by an array of numbers (can be nil or empty array if empty), example:\n\n```ruby\npockets = { \n  bob: [1],\n  tom: [2, 5],\n  jane: [7]\n} \n```\n\nWrite method which helps Sherlock to find suspects. If no suspect is found or there are no pockets (```pockets == nil```), the method should return nil.\n\n\n```ruby\nfind_suspects(pockets, [1, 2]) # => [:tom, :jane]\nfind_suspects(pockets, [1, 7, 5, 2]) # => nil\nfind_suspects(pockets, []) # => [:bob, :tom, :jane]\nfind_suspects(pockets, [7]) # => [:bob, :tom]\n```\n",
