  "description": "## Story\n\nJohn runs a shop, bought some goods, and then sells them. He used a special accounting method, like this:\n```\n[[60,20],[60,-20]]\n```\nEach sub array records the commodity price and profit/loss to sell (percentage). Positive mean profit and negative means loss.\n\nIn the example above, John's first commodity sold at a price of $60, he made a profit of 20%; Second commodities are sold at a price of $60 too, but he lost 20%.\n\nPlease calculate, whether his account is profit or loss in the end?\n    \n## Rules\n\nWrite a function ```profitLoss```, argument ```records``` is the list of sales.\n\nreturn a number(positive or negative), round to two decimal places.\n    \n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nIn the example above:\nprofitLoss([[60,20],[60,-20]]) should return -5\n\nBecause the cost of the first commodity is 50, \n        the cost of the second commodity is 75,\n        the total cost is: 50+75=125\n        Selling price is:  60+60=120\nSo the end result is 120-125=-5. He made a loss of $5.\n\nprofitLoss([[100,20],[80,-20]]) should return -3.33\nprofitLoss([[60,100],[60,-50]]) should return -30\nprofitLoss([[60,0],[60,0]]) should return 0\n```",
