  "description": "### Task:\n\nA magician in the subway showed you a trick, he put an ice brick in a bottle to impress you. The brick's length and width are equal, forming a square; its height may be different. Just for fun and also to impress the magician and people around, you decided to calculate the brick's volume. Write a function `iceBrickVolume` that will accept these parameters:\n\n- `radius` - bottle's radius (always > 0);\n- `bottleLength` - total bottle length (always > 0);\n- `rimLength` - length from bottle top to brick (always < `bottleLength`);\n\nAnd return volume of ice brick that magician managed to put into a bottle.\n\n![illustration](https://i.imgur.com/vU2zzm4.png)\n\n### Note:\n\nAll inputs are integers. Assume no irregularities to the cuboid brick.\nYou may assume the bottle is shaped like a cylinder. The brick cannot fit inside the rim. The ice brick placed into the bottle is the largest possible cuboid that could actually fit inside the inner volume. \n\n### Example 1:\n```c\nradius = 1\nbottle_length = 10\nrim_length = 2\n\nvolume = 16\n```\n### Example 2:\n```c\nradius = 5\nbottle_length = 30\nrim_length = 7\n\nvolume = 1150\n```\n",
