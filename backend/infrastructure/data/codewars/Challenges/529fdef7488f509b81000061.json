  "description": "In elementary arithmetic a \"carry\" is a digit that is transferred from one column of digits to another column of more significant digits during a calculation algorithm.\n\nThis Kata is about determining the number of carries performed during the addition of multi-digit numbers.\n\nYou will receive an input string containing a set of pairs of numbers formatted as follows:\n\n```\n123 456\n555 555\n123 594\n```\n\nAnd your output should be a string formatted as follows:\n\n```\nNo carry operation\n3 carry operations\n1 carry operations\n```\n\n### Some Assumptions\n\n- Assume that numbers can be of any length.\n- But both numbers in the pair will be of the same length.\n- Although not all the numbers in the set need to be of the same length.\n- If a number is shorter, it will be zero-padded.\n- The input may contain any arbitrary number of pairs.\n",
