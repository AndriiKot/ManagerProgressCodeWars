  "description": "The description is rather long but it tries to explain what a financing plan is. \n\nThe fixed monthly payment for a fixed rate mortgage is the amount paid by the borrower every month that ensures \nthat the loan is paid off in full with interest at the end of its term. \n\nThe monthly payment formula is based on the annuity formula. \nThe monthly payment `c` depends upon:\n\n- `rate` - the monthly interest rate is expressed as a decimal, not a percentage. \nThe monthly rate is simply the **given** yearly percentage rate divided by 100 and then by 12.\n\n- `term` - the number of monthly payments, called the loan's `term`.\n- `principal` - the amount borrowed, known as the loan's principal (or `balance`).\n\nFirst we have to determine `c`.\n\nWe have: `c = n /d` with `n = r * balance` and `d = 1 - (1 + r)**(-term)` where `**` is the `power` function (you can look at the reference below).\n\nThe payment `c` is composed of two parts. The first part pays the interest (let us call it `int`)\ndue for the balance of the given month, the second part repays the balance (let us call this part `princ`) hence for the following month we get a `new balance = old balance - princ` with `c = int + princ`. \n\nLoans are structured so that the amount of principal returned to the borrower starts out small and increases with each mortgage payment. \nWhile the mortgage payments in the first years consist primarily of interest payments, the payments in the final years consist primarily of principal repayment.\n\nA mortgage's amortization schedule provides a detailed look at precisely what portion of each mortgage payment is dedicated to each component.\n\nIn an example of a $100,000, 30-year mortgage with a rate of 6 percents the amortization schedule consists of 360 monthly payments.\nThe partial amortization schedule below shows with 2 decimal floats\nthe balance between principal and interest payments.\n\n--|num_payment|c          |princ      |int        |Balance    |\n--|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n--|1          |599.55     |99.55      |500.00     |99900.45   |\n--|...        |599.55     |...        |...        |...        |\n--|12         |599.55     |105.16     |494.39     |98,771.99  |\n--|...        |599.55     |...        |...        |...        |\n--|360        |599.55     |596.57     |2.98       |0.00       |\n\n#### Task:\nGiven parameters \n```\nrate: annual rate as percent (don't forgent to divide by 100*12)\nbal: original balance (borrowed amount) \nterm: number of monthly payments\nnum_payment: rank of considered month (from 1 to term)\n```\nthe function `amort` will return a formatted string (for example):\n\n`\"num_payment %d c %.0f princ %.0f int %.0f balance %.0f\" (with arguments num_payment, c, princ, int, balance`)\n\n***In Common Lisp:***\nreturn a list with num-payment, c, princ, int, balance each rounded.\n\n#### Examples:\n```\namort(6, 100000, 360, 1) ->\n\"num_payment 1 c 600 princ 100 int 500 balance 99900\"\n\namort(6, 100000, 360, 12) ->\n\"num_payment 12 c 600 princ 105 int 494 balance 98772\"\n\n```\n#### Ref\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_calculator>\n\n",
