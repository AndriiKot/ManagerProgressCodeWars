  "description": "You have to search all numbers from inclusive 1 to inclusive a given number x, that have the given digit d in it.<br>\nThe value of d will always be 0 - 9.<br>\nThe value of x will always be greater than 0.\n\nYou have to return as an array<br>\n - the count of these numbers,<br>\n - their sum <br>\n - and their product.<br>\n<br>\nFor example:<br>\n\n```\nx = 11\nd = 1\n->\nNumbers: 1, 10, 11\nReturn: [3, 22, 110]\n```\n<br>\nIf there are no numbers, which include the digit, return [0,0,0]. \n<br>\n<br>\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) <br>\n<br>\nI have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.<br>\n",
