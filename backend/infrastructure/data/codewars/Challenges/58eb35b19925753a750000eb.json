  "description": "You are going to write a simple console-style drawing board program.\n\n### Functions\nThe drawing board is very simple so only these functions are supported.\n\nFunction | Description\n-------- | -----------\nCreate canvas | Create new empty canvas (filled with ' ') with given width and height\nDraw line / rectangle | Draw the line with 'x' which connects the given points.<br> If the points are diagonal, a rectangle instead of diagonal line should be drawn\nFill color | Fill the entire area connected to the given point with given character, also known as \"bucket fill\" in paint programs\n\n### Output\nImplement the `drawCanvas` method to return the string contains the entire canvas surrounded by borders with `-` and `|`.\n\n### Example\nEmpty canvas 4x2\n```\n------\n|    |\n|    |\n------\n```\n\nDrawing 2 lines\n`(0, 2)` to `(4, 2)` and `(2, 0)` to `(2, 4)`\n```\n-------\n|  x  |\n|  x  |\n|xxxxx|\n|  x  |\n|  x  |\n-------\n```\n\nDrawing a rectangle `(1, 1)` to `(5, 4)` and fill with `o`\n```\n---------\n|       |\n| xxxxx |\n| xooox |\n| xooox |\n| xxxxx |\n|       |\n---------\n```\n\n### Error handling\nFor any invalid input, raise an error/exception depends on the language.\n\n- In `Java` should throw `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException`\n- In `JavaScript` should throw the string `Out of bounds`\n\nThe data type of the arguments is **always valid**, no need to do type checks.\n\n### Remarks\n- The drawing board functions should return the object itself to allow `method chaining`\n- The coordinates are zero-based, therefore the origin is `(0, 0)`, which is at the top-left corner\n- The coordinates are inclusive in `draw` method\n- If the area is already filled with different color, `fill` method should do nothing",
