  "description": "Once a keen blogger has finished writing a post in Word, she then has to crawl through it and edit out some of the punctuation marks, so that she can upload his new post with correct spacing and symbols.  You need to create a Regexp that will help him with this task.\n\nShe will enter her post one paragraph at a time, so each non-empty string given to the function must be returned with `<p>` preceding it and a  `</p>` at the end of it. \n\nOnly the following punctuation marks must also be ammended: \n\n| Punctuation           | Char | Encoded   |\n|-----------------------|------|-----------|\n| dash                  | `–`  | `&ndash;` |\n| apostrophe            | `’`  | `&rsquo;` |\n| ampercant             | `&`  | `&amp;`   |\n| open quotation marks  | `“`  | `&ldquo;` |\n| close quotation marks | `”`  | `&rdquo;` |\n\n\n## Example:\n\n```javascript\nhtmlify(\"Jess says “Frank & Joe aren’t the best bloggers”\");\n```\n\nReturns:\n\n```html\n<p>Jess says & ldquo;Frank & amp; Joe aren& rsquo;t the best bloggers& rdquo;</p>\n```\n\n## Additional note\n\nIf you want to actually use this function you can adapt it to suit your preferred word processor's punctuation marks into it.\n",
