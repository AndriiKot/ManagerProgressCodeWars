  "description": "\nA quine is a computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output. The quine concept can be extended to multiple levels of recursion, giving rise to \"ouroboros programs\", or quine-relays.<br/>\n```if:ruby\nSo your goal is to write a Ruby program that would produce an SQL program that would produce your Ruby program.\n```\n```if:sql\nSo your goal is to write an SQL program that would produce a Ruby program that would produce your SQL program.\n```\n```if:javascript\nSo your goal is to write a JS program that would produce an SQL program that would produce your JS program.\n```\nTo make task more clear we should define what program is. As we are Codewarriors, so:\n```if:javascript\n**JS program:** A function named `solution` that returns a string\n```\n```if:ruby,sql\n**Ruby program:** A function named `solution` that returns a string\n```\n**SQL program:** A query that returns one row with one column `solution` with value being a string\n```if:ruby,sql\n*Ruby version: 3.0*\n```\n```if:ruby\n*SQL version: SQLite 3.27.2*\n```\n```if:javascript\n*SQL version: SQLite 3.40.0*\n```\n```if:sql\n*SQL version: PostgreSQL 13.0*\n```",
