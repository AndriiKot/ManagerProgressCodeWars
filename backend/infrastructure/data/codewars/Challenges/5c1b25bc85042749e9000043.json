  "description": "Your music theory class just gave you a homework where you have to find the keys for a bunch of melodies.  You decided to be lazy and create a key detection program to do the work for you.\n\nEach melody in this assignment is supposed to be strictly derived from a major scale. There are twelve major scales each of which starts from a differnt one of the twelve musical notes. The twelve musical notes are, in ascending order:\n\n`C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B`\n\n(For simplicity, we only use sharps( # ) and not flats( b ))\n\nA major scale has seven unique notes and follows a specific intervalic pattern.\nFor instance, the ascending C major scale with notes C,D,E,F,G,A and B follows this pattern:\n\n<pre>\n<code>Notes       C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C\nDistance      2   2   1   2   2   2   1</code></pre>\n\nThe number indicated below each set of two notes shows the distance of the two notes. Between C and D, you have distance of 2 because you skip C#, but between E and F the distance is only 1.\n\nThe same pattern (2-2-1-2-2-2-1) occurs in every major scale.\nE major scale, which starts on the note E, goes:\n\n<pre>\n<code>Notes       E - F# - G# - A - B - C# - D# - E\nDistance      2    2    1   2   2    2    1</code></pre>\n\nYour task is to create a function that takes a melody as a string and if the melody uses all the seven notes of a major scale, but no other notes, returns a string:\n\n`\"? major scale\"`\n\nWhere `?` is the starting note of the scale (or the \"key center\").\nFor instance, the input melody `\"C#D#FF#D#FF#G#A#C\"` returns `\"C# major scale\"`.\n\nBeware! A melody doesn't always start on the first note of a scale. \nFor example, `\"D#BC#ABG#AF#E\"` should return `\"E major scale\"`.\n\nIf the melody is not derived from any of the major scales, return:\n\n`\"No major scale\"`\n\nNote:\n\n<pre>\n- Input contains only -> 'C','D','E','F','G','A','B', or '#' (no lower case)\n- No other letters, space, number or special characters are included\n- Even if a melody misses only one note from a scale, return \"No major scale\"(for instance, \"CDEFGA\" is not a complete C major scale)\n- Note names E# and B# are invalid, and input with these should return \"No major scale\"\n- Also invalid to have two sharps in a row (##), if this happens return \"No major scale\"</pre>\n- Also invalid to have two sharps in a row (##), if this happens, return \"No major scale\"\n- Input string that starts with a sharp should also return \"No major scale\"\n</pre>\n",
