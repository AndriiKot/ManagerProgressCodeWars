  "description": "We define the sequence ```SF``` in the following way in terms of four previous sequences: ```S1```, ```S2```, ```S3``` and ```ST```\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/kCiwfWT\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/kCiwfWT.jpg?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nWe are interested in collecting the terms of SF that are multiple of ten.\n\nThe first term multiple of ten of this sequence is  ```60```\n\nMake the function ```find_mult10_SF()``` that you introduce the ordinal number of a term multiple of 10 of SF and gives us the value of this term.\n\nLet's see some cases: \n```python\nfind_mult10_SF(1) == 60\n\nfind_mult10_SF(2) == 70080\n\nfind_mult10_SF(3) ==  90700800\n```\n``` haskell\nfindMult10SF 1 `shouldBe` 60\nfindMult10SF 2 `shouldBe` 70080\nfindMult10SF 3 `shouldBe` 90700800\n```\nMemoization is advisable to have a more agile code for tests.\n\n~~~if-not:rust,go\nYour code will be tested up to the 300-th term, multiple of 10.\n~~~\n~~~if:rust,go\nYour code will be tested up to the 300-th term, multiple of 10, in fixed tests, then 100 random numbers in the interval [301, 2000).\n~~~\nHappy coding!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
