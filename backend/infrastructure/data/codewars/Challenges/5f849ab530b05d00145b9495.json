  "description": "This kata is a slightly harder version of [Gravity Flip](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5f70c883e10f9e0001c89673). It is recommended to do that first.\n\nBob is bored in his physics lessons yet again, and this time, he's brought a more complex gravity-changing box with him. It's 3D, with small cubes arranged in a matrix of `n`×`m` columns. It can change gravity to go in a certain direction, which can be `'L'`, `'R'`, `'D'`, and `'U'` (left, right, down, and up).\n\nGiven the initial configuration of the cubes inside of the box as a 2D array, determine how the cubes are arranged after Bob switches the gravity. \n\nSee the sample tests for examples.",
