  "description": "## Task & Rules\n\nGive you an array ```arr``` that contains some number elements, find out the ```peaks``` and ```valleys``` in the array, and return them.\n\nWhat do the peaks and valleys mean? If an element is larger than the three one on the left and larger than the three one on the right, we call it a ```peak```. In contrast, an element is smaller than the value of the three elements(left and right), we call it a ```valley```.\nan example:\n```\n[10,20,30,40,30,20,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,15,14,13]\n```\nIn the example above, peaks and valleys are:\n```\n[10,20,30,40,30,20,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,15,14,13]\n\n[         40   ,   10        ,       16         ]\n```\n    \n\n## Some examples:\n\n```javascript\npeakAndValley([10,20,30,40,30,20,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,15,14,13]) \nshould return [40,10,16]\n\npeakAndValley([50,84,49,47,80,87,87,53,76,30,10])\nshould return [47]\n\npeakAndValley([45,94,41,76,29,96,28,13,84,69,25])\nshould return [96,13]\n\npeakAndValley([1,16,63,78,53,78,42,39,46,88,49,96,58,82])\nshould return [39]\n\npeakAndValley([45,75,47,44,93,95,31,99,49,48,76,2,92,23,26,19,60,45,51])\nshould return [31,99,2,92,19]\n\npeakAndValley([49,97,76,56,96,88,65,20,14,93,32])\nshould return []\n```",
