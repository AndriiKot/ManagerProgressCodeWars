  "description": "Jack's teacher gave him a ton of equations for homework. The thing is they are all kind of same so they are boring.\n\nSo help him by making a equation solving function that will return the value of x.\n\nTest Cases will be like this:\n\n```\n# INPUT            # RETURN\n'x + 1 = 9 - 2'    # 6\n'- 10 = x'         # -10\n'x - 2 + 3 = 2'    # 1\n'- x = - 1'        # 1\n```\n- All test cases are valid.\n- Every `+`, `-` and numbers will be separated by space.\n- There will be only one `x` either on the left or right.\n- `x` can have a `-` mark before it.\n- returned object will be a integer.",
