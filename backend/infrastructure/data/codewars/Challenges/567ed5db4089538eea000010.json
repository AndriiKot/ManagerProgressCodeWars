  "description": "Our nuclear missile manager system is coded in Node.js. We are currently testing the system and it seems that the `launchAll` function does not work as expected. It should launch 5 missiles each  1 second apart. The current code tries to launch the missile #5 five times...\n\nCan you fix this for us? You know, it's pretty critical code...\n\n**Note**: There are 5 missiles labeled `i` which is a number in {0, 1, 2, 3,  4}. The missile `i` should be launched after `i` seconds.",
