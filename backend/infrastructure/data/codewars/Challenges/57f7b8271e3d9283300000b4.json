  "description": "Given a string of digits confirm whether the sum of all the individual even digits are greater than the sum of all the indiviudal odd digits. Always a string of numbers will be given.\n\n* If the sum of even numbers is greater than the odd numbers return: `\"Even is greater than Odd\"`\n\n* If the sum of odd numbers is greater than the sum of even numbers return: `\"Odd is greater than Even\"`\n  \n* If the total of both even and odd numbers are identical return: `\"Even and Odd are the same\"`\n  \n\n  \n",
