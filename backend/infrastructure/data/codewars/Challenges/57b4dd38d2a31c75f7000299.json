  "description": "Life isn't always easy as a small word amongst big words. If only they had a code warrior to help them out...\n\nYour task is to make all words which are 3 characters or less into capitals. You should also remove any vowels from 'long' (4 characters or more) words. \n\nFor example: \n\n```\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"```\n\nShould become:\n\n```\"THE qck brwn FOX jmps vr THE lzy DOG\"```\n\n\nFor the purposes of this kata, mid-word punctuation counts towards the character limit of a word.\n\ne.g: ```\"it's / I'm\"``` should become: ```\"t's / I'M\"```\n\n",
