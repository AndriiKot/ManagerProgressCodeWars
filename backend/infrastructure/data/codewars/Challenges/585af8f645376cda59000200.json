  "description": "You have a collection of lovely poems. Unfortunately, they aren't formatted very well. They're all on one line, like this:\n\n```\nBeautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated.\n```\nWhat you want is to present each sentence on a new line, so that it looks like this:\n```\nBeautiful is better than ugly.\nExplicit is better than implicit.\nSimple is better than complex.\nComplex is better than complicated.\n```\nWrite a function that takes a string (like the one line example) as an argument, returns a new string that is formatted across multiple lines, with each new sentence starting on a new line when you print it out.\n\nTry to solve this challenge with the [str.split()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) and the [str.join()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join) string methods.\n\nEvery sentence will end with a period, and every new sentence will have one space before the previous period. Be careful about trailing whitespace in your solution.\n",
