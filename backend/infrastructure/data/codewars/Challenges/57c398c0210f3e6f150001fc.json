They want to race to see who first ran to the top of the mountain, the distance is 1000 meters. The hare runs very fast. When he ran to 500 meters, the tortoise was far behind. The hare decided to have a sleep. Zzz...\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, he was surprised to find that the tortoise was near the finish. Only the last 40 meters. The hare hurried to catch the turtle.\n\nQuestion: Who is the winner? The tortoise or the hare? How many minutes does the hare sleep?\n\n## Task\n\nComplete function `race()` that accepts 5 arguments: \n\n- `speed1` The speed of hare.\n- `speed2` The speed of tortoise.\n- `distance` Race distance.\n- `sleep` The distance from starting point to the location of the hare to sleep.\n- `getup` When the hare woke up, the distance between the tortoise and the ending point.\n \nThe result should be a string. like these:\n```\n\"The hare won the race. He is sleeping for XX minutes.\"\nor\n\"The tortoise won the race. The hare is sleeping for XX minutes.\"\nor\n\"The hare and the tortoise tied. The hare is sleeping for XX minutes.\"\n```\n\nXX is a number of minutes(round to integer). \n\n## Example\n\n```\n//The example in the story:\nrace(100,10,1000,500,40) should return:\n\"The tortoise won the race. The hare is sleeping for 91 minutes.\"\n\nrace(100,10,1500,500,100) should return:\n\"The hare and the tortoise tied. The hare is sleeping for 135 minutes.\"\n\nrace(100,10,1200,500,100) should return:\n \"The hare won the race. He is sleeping for 105 minutes.\"\n\n```",
