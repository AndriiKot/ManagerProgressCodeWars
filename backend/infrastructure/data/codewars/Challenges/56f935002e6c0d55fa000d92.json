  "description": "# Fun with ES6 Classes #2 - Animals and Inheritance\n\n## Overview\n\nPreloaded for you in this Kata is a ```class Animal```:\n\n```javascript\nclass Animal {\n  constructor(name, age, legs, species, status) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.age = age;\n    this.legs = legs;\n    this.species = species;\n    this.status = status;\n  }\n  introduce() {\n    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;\n  }\n}\n```\n```csharp\npublic class Animal\n{\n  public int Age;\n  public int Legs;\n  public string Name;\n  public string Species;\n  public string Status;\n  \n  public Animal(string name, int age, int legs, string species, string status)\n  {\n    this.Name = name;\n    this.Age = age;\n    this.Legs = legs;\n    this.Species = species;\n    this.Status = status;\n  }\n  \n  public virtual string Introduce()\n  {\n    return $\"Hello, my name is {this.Name} and I am {this.Age} years old.\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Task\n\nDefine the following classes that inherit from ```Animal```.\n\n### I. Shark\n\nThe constructor function for Shark should accept 3 arguments in total in the following order: `name, age, status`.  **All sharks should have a leg count of **`0`** (since they obviously do not have any legs) and should have a **`species`** of **`\"shark\"`**.**\n\n### II. Cat\n\nThe constructor function for Cat should accept the same 3 arguments as with Shark: `name, age, status`.  Cats should always have a leg count of `4` and a species of `\"cat\"`.\n\nFurthermore, the `introduce`/`Introduce` method for `Cat` should be identical to the original except there should be **exactly 2 spaces** and the words `\"Meow meow!\"` after the phrase.  For example:\n\n```javascript\nvar example = new Cat(\"Example\", 10, \"Happy\");\nexample.introduce() === \"Hello, my name is Example and I am 10 years old.  Meow meow!\"; // Notice the TWO spaces - very important\n```\n```csharp\nCat example = new Cat(\"Example\", 10, \"Happy);\nexample.Introduce() => \"Hello, my name is Example and I am 10 years old.  Meow meow!\"; // Notice the TWO spaces - very important\n```\n\n### III. Dog\n\nThe Dog constructor should accept 4 arguments in the specified order: `name, age, status, master`.  `master` is the name of the dog's master which will be a string.  Furthermore, dogs should have `4` legs and a species of `\"dog\"`.\n\nDogs have an identical `introduce`/`Introduce` method as any other animal, but they have their own method called `greetMaster`/`GreetMaster` which accepts no arguments and returns `\"Hello (insert_master_name_here)\"` (of course **not** the literal string but replace the `(insert_master_name_here)` with the name of the dog's master).",
