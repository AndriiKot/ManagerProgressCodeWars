  "description": "Find the length between 2 co-ordinates.  The co-ordinates are made of integers between -20 and 20 and will be given in the form of a 2D array:\n\n(0,0) and (5,-7) would be [ [ 0 , 0 ] , [ 5, -7 ] ]\n\nThe function must return the answer rounded to 2 decimal places in the form of a string.\n\n```javascript\nlengthOfLine([ [ 0 , 0 ] , [ 5, -7 ] ]); => \"8.60\"\n```\n```python\nlength_of_line([[0, 0], [5, -7]]) => \"8.60\"\n```\n```ruby\nlength_of_line([[0, 0], [5, -7]]) # => \"8.60\"\n```\n\nIf the 2 given co-ordinates are the same, the returned length should be \"0.00\" \n",
