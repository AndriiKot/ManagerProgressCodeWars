  "description": "On 08/26/2016 (26.08.2016) the German Fussball-Bundesliga (national soccer league) started another new season!\n\nIn this kata you get an array with 9 strings, which contain the matches from the first match day.<br>\nEvery string has this format, where x and y are the number of goals for the teams, if the match has already been played:\n```\nx:y [Team 1] - [Team 2]\n\nExample:\n6:0 FC Bayern München - Werder Bremen\n-:- Eintracht Frankfurt - Schalke 04\n```\n\nThe team, which has shot more goals than the other team, wins the match.\n\nYour method should create and return the league table as one string.<br>\n\nEvery line in the table follows these rules:\n```\n 1. Tableplace with two chars and a dot (\" 1.\", \"12.\")\n 2. Space\n 3. Name of the team/club padded right up to 30 chars (filled up with spaces).\n 4. Number of played matches (in this kata always only one digit)\n 5. Two spaces\n 6. Number of won matches (in this kata always only one digit)\n 7. Two spaces\n 8. Number of tie matches (in this kata always only one digit)\n 9. Two spaces\n10. Number of lost matches (in this kata always only one digit)\n11. Two spaces\n12. Differences of goals (shot vs. gotten)\n13. Two spaces\n14. Count of points\n```\nIt is 3 points for a won match and 1 point for a tie.<br>\nThe table has to be sorted by these criteria:\n```\n1. Points\n2. If the points are the same: The difference of goals. (2:0 is better than 1:0)\n3. If the difference of goals is the same: More goals are better! (2:1 is better than 1:0)\n4. Otherwise: The teams share the same place, but ordered by the name of the team (case-insensitive!)!\n```\nExample with the two matches above, if the league WOULD only have 4 teams:\n```\n 1. FC Bayern München             1  1  0  0  6:0  3 \n 2. Eintrach Frankfurt            0  0  0  0  0:0  0\n 2. Schalke 04                    0  0  0  0  0:0  0\n 4. Werder Bremen                 1  0  0  1  0:6  0\n```\nYou do not have to do a check for the input values. It will always be an array of 9 strings and all strings will be complete!\n\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)\n\nI have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.",
