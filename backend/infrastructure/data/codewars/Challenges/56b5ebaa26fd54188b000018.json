  "description": "Amicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. (A proper divisor of a number is a positive factor of that number other than the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.) \n\nFor example, the smallest pair of amicable numbers is (220, 284); for the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; and the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142, of which the sum is 220.\n\nDerive a function which returns ```true/True``` if pair ```num1 num2``` are amicable, ```false/False``` if not.\n\nSee more at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicable_numbers",
