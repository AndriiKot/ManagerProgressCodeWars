  "description": "In a string we describe a road. There are cars that move to the right and we denote them with \">\" and cars that move to the left and we denote them with \"<\". There are also cameras that are indicated by: \" . \". \n<br>\nA camera takes a photo of a car if it moves to the direction of the camera.\n\n<b style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Task</b> <br>\nYour task is to write a function such that, for the input string that represents a road as described, returns the total number of photos that were taken by the cameras. The complexity should be strictly O(N) in order to pass all the tests. \n\n<br>\n<b>Examples</b>\n\n```javascript\nFor \">>.\" -> 2 photos were taken\nFor \".>>\" -> 0 photos were taken\nFor \">.<.\" -> 3 photos were taken\nFor \".><.>>.<<\" -> 11 photos were taken\n```",
