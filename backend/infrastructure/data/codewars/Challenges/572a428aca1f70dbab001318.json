  "description": "I keep burning my toast! \n\nPlease can you create some basic JavaScript code to stop this happening. I want to input the type of bread and in return I want to know how long to toast the bread for.  \n\n\"white bread\"             --->     \"1 min\" <br>\n\"frozen white bread\"      --->     \"1.5 mins\" <br>\n\"brown bread\"             --->     \"2 mins\" <br>\n\"frozen brown bread\"      --->     \"3 mins\" <br>\n\nAnything else that you put in the toaster should return \"Please do not put that in the toaster!\"\n\nYour toaster has to be case insensitive. \n\nThis all seems easy enough! The only problem is that our toaster is unbelievably basic. You have to complete this function in just 250 characters!\n\nIf you use ES6 features like Let and Const declaration, the code will get longer due to the transformation by babel. ",
