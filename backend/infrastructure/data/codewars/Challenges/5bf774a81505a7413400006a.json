  "description": "In English, all words at the begining of a sentence should begin with a capital letter.\n\nYou will be given a paragraph that does not use capital letters. Your job is to capitalise the first letter of the first word of each sentence.\n\nFor example, \n\ninput:\n\n`\"hello. my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die.\"`\n\noutput:\n\n`\"Hello. My name is inigo montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\"`\n\n\nYou may assume:\n\n  - there will be no punctuation besides full stops and spaces\n  \n  - all but the last full stop will be followed by a space and at least one word\n  ",
