  "description": "The integers `14` and `15` are contiguous (i.e. the difference between them is `1`) and have the same number of divisors:\n\n```python\n14 ----> 1, 2, 7, 14 # (4 divisors)\n15 ----> 1, 3, 5, 15 # (4 divisors)\n```\n\nThe next pair of contiguous integers with this property is `21` and `22`:\n\n```python\n21 -----> 1, 3,  7, 21 # (4 divisors)\n22 -----> 1, 2, 11, 22 # (4 divisors)\n```\n\nWe have `8` pairs of integers below `50` having this property, they are:\n```python\n[ [2, 3], [14, 15], [21, 22], [26, 27], [33, 34], [34, 35], [38, 39], [44, 45] ]\n```\n\nLet's see now the integers that have a difference of `3` between them. There are `7` pairs below `100`:\n\n```python\n[ [2, 5], [35, 38], [55, 58], [62, 65], [74, 77], [82, 85], [91, 94] ]\n```\n\nLet's name:\n* *diff*, the difference between two integers, next and prev, (`diff = next - prev`)\n* *nMax*, an upper bound of the range.\n\nWe need a function that receives two integer parameters, *diff* and *nMax*, and outputs the count of pairs of integers that fulfill this property, all of them being *strictly* smaller than *nMax*.\n\nSo, for the examples detailed above:\n```python\n(diff = 1, nMax =  50) -----> 8\n(diff = 3, nMax = 100) -----> 7\n```\n\nHappy coding!!!\n\n",
