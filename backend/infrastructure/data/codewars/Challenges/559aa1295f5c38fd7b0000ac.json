  "description": "Given a side length `n`, traveling only right and down how many ways are there to get from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of an `n by n` grid?\n\nYour mission is to write a program to do just that!\n\nAdd code to `route(n)` that returns the number of routes for a grid `n by n` (if n is less than 1 return 0).\n\nExamples:\n    \n    -100 -> 0\n    \n    1 -> 2\n     \n    2 -> 6\n     \n    20 -> 137846528820\n    \nNote: \nyou're traveling on the edges of the squares in the grid not the squares themselves.\n\nPS.If anyone has any suggestions of how to improve this kata please let me know.\n",
