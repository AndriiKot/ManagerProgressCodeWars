  "description": "Complete the LeagueTable class.\r\n\r\nThe LeagueTable class is used to store results of football (soccer) matches played, as well as return and display various stats about each team.\r\n\r\nMatch results will always be passed through the `push` method as a String in the format: `\"Home Team 0 - 0 Away Team\"`. For example: `\"Man Utd 3 - 0 Liverpool\"`.\r\n\r\nWhen a new match result is given, points are awarded to teams as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n3 points for a win\r\n1 point for a draw\r\n0 points for loss\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe class must have the following methods:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\npush(match_string)             # insert a new match record\r\n\r\nget_points(team_name)          # Returns the no. of points a team has, 0 by default\r\nget_goals_for(team_name)       # Returns the no. of goals a team has scored, 0 by default\r\nget_goals_against(team_name)   # Returns the no. of goals a team has conceeded (had scored against them), 0 by default\r\nget_goal_difference(team_name) # Return the no. of goals a team has scored minus the no. of goals a team has conceeded, 0 by default\r\nget_wins(team_name)            # Return the no. of wins a team has, 0 by default\r\nget_draws(team_name)           # Return the no. of draws a team has, 0 by default\r\nget_losses(team_name)          # Return the no. of losses a team has, 0 by default\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nlt = LeagueTable.new\r\n\r\nlt.push(\"Man Utd 3 - 0 Liverpool\")\r\n\r\nputs lt.get_goals_for(\"Man Utd\") => 3\r\nputs lt.get_points(\"Man Utd\") => 3\r\nputs lt.get_points(\"Liverpool\") => 0\r\nputs lt.get_goal_difference(\"Liverpool\") => -3\r\n\r\nlt.push(\"Liverpool 1 - 1 Man Utd\")\r\n\r\nputs lt.get_goals_for(\"Man Utd\") => 4\r\nputs lt.get_points(\"Man Utd\") => 4\r\nputs lt.get_points(\"Liverpool\") => 1\r\nputs lt.get_goals_against(\"Man Utd\") => 1\r\n\r\nputs lt.get_points(\"Tottenham\") => 0\r\n```",
