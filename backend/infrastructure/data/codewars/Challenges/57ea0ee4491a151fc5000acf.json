  "description": "## Task\nTo charge your mobile phone battery, do you know how much time it takes from 0% to 100%? It depends on your cell phone battery capacity and the power of the charger. A rough calculation method is:\n\n```\n0% --> 85%  (fast charge)\n(battery capacity(mAh) * 85%) / power of the charger(mA)\n\n85% --> 95% (decreasing charge)\n(battery capacity(mAh) * 10%) / (power of the charger(mA) * 50%)\n\n95% --> 100% (trickle charge)\n(battery capacity(mAh) * 5%) / (power of the charger(mA) * 20%)\n```\nFor example: Your battery capacity is 1000 mAh and you use a charger 500 mA,  to charge your mobile phone battery from 0% to 100% needs time:\n\n```\n0% --> 85%  (fast charge) 1.7 (hour)\n\n85% --> 95% (decreasing charge) 0.4 (hour)\n\n95% --> 100% (trickle charge) 0.5 (hour)\n\ntotal times = 1.7 + 0.4 + 0.5 = 2.6 (hour)\n```\n\n Complete function `calculateTime` that accepts two arguments `battery` and `charger`, return how many hours can charge the battery from 0% to 100%. The result should be a number, round to 2 decimal places (In Haskell, no need to round it).\n",
