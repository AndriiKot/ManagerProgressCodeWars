  "description": "Pine's grandma is hearing impaired: whatever you say to her, she responds with `\"HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!\"`, unless you shout it (type in all capitals).\n\nIf you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back, `\"NO, NOT SINCE 1938!\"` You can't stop talking to grandma until you shout `\"BYE\"`.\n\nWhen you shout `\"BYE\"`, grandma shouts back `\"OK, BYE!\"` and end the conversation.\n\n* Your input is an array with a list of strings with all the words/sentences you say in order\n* You can expect there is aways a `\"BYE\"`, although it is not necessarily the last word in the list\n* Your output is an array with a list of strings and every sentence Pine's grandma replies\n* Words/sentences are always a string\n\n\n## Example\n\n```python\n[\"hi grandma\", \"WHAT\", \"bye\", \"BYE\"]  -->\n[\"HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!\", \"NO, NOT SINCE 1938!\", \"HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!\", \"OK, BYE!\"]\n```\n\nBased, inspired and stolen with love from [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/), by Chris Pine",
