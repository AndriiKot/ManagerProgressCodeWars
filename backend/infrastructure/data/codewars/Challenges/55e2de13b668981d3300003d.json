  "description": "You are provided with a function of the form `f(x) = axⁿ`, that consists of a single term only and 'a' and 'n' are integers, e.g `f(x) = 3x²`, `f(x) = 5` etc.\n\nYour task is to create a function that takes f(x) as the argument and returns the result of differentiating the function, that is, the derivative.\n\nIf `$ f(x) = ax^n $`, then `$ f^{\\prime}(x) = nax^{n-1} $`\n\nInput is a string, for example `\"5x^4\"`. The function f(x) consists of a single term only. Variable is denoted by `x`.  \nOutput should be a string, for example `\"20x^3\"`.  \n\n### Examples\n\n```text\n\"3x^2\"  => \"6x\"\n\"-5x^3\" => \"-15x^2\"\n\"6x^-2\" => \"-12x^-3\"\n\"5x\"    => \"5\"\n\"-x\"    => \"-1\"\n\"42\"    => \"0\"\n```",
