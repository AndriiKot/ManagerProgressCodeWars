  "description": "The cuckoo bird pops out of the cuckoo clock and chimes once on the quarter hour, half hour, and three-quarter hour. At the beginning of each hour (1-12), it chimes out the hour. Given the current time and a positive integer <code>n,</code> determine the time when the cuckoo bird has chimed <code>n</code> times. \n\nInputs: <br>\n<code>initial_time</code> - a string in the format <code>\"HH:MM\",</code> where <code>1 ≤ HH ≤ 12</code> and <code>0 ≤ MM ≤ 59,</code> with leading 0’s if necessary. <br>\n<code>n</code> - an integer representing the target number of chimes, with <code>1 ≤ n ≤ 200.</code><br>\nOutput: The time when the cuckoo bird has chimed <code>n</code> times - a string in the same format as <code>initial_time</code>.\n\nIf the cuckoo bird chimes at <code>initial_time,</code> include those chimes in the count. If the <code>n'th</code>chime is reached on the hour, report the time at the start of that hour (i.e. assume the cuckoo finishes chiming before the minute is up).\n\nExample: <code>\"03:38\", 19</code> should return <code>\"06:00\".</code> <br>\nExplanation: It chimes once at <code>\"03:45\",</code>4 times at <code>\"04:00\",</code> once each at <code>\"04:15\", \"04:30\", \"04:45\",</code> 5 times at <code>\"05:00\",</code> and once each at <code>\"05:15\", \"05:30\", \"05:45\".</code> At this point it has chimed 16 times, so the 19th chime occurs when it chimes 6 times at <code>\"06:00\".</code>\n\nSource: International Collegiate Programming Contest, North Central North American Regional, 2023.\n\nRelated Kata: [Fizz Buzz Cuckoo Clock](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58485a43d750d23bad0000e6)",
