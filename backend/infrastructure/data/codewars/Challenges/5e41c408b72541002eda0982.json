  "description": "You are provided with the following functions:\n\n```python\nt = type\nk = lambda x: lambda _: x\n```\n\nWrite a function `f` that returns the string `Hello, world!`.\n\nThe rules are:\n\n* The solution should not exceed 33 lines\n* Every line should have at most 2 characters\n\nNote: There is the same [kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5935558a32fb828aad001213) for this task on JS, but way harder than Python one, so it is the best option to create a separated kata with fair rank.",
