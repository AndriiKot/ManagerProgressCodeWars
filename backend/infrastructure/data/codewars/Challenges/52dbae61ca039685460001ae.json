  "description": "Create a function which accepts one arbitrary string as an argument, and return a string of length 26.\n\nThe objective is to set each of the 26 characters of the output string to either `'1'` or `'0'` based on the fact whether the Nth letter of the alphabet is present in the input (independent of its case).\n\nSo if an `'a'` or an `'A'` appears anywhere in the input string (any number of times), set the first character of the output string to `'1'`, otherwise to `'0'`. if `'b'` or `'B'` appears in the string, set the second character to `'1'`, and so on for the rest of the alphabet.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```\n\"a   **&  cZ\"  =>  \"10100000000000000000000001\"\n```\n```\n\"aaaaaaa79345675\"  =>  \"10000000000000000000000000\"\n```\n```\n\"&%#*\"  =>  \"00000000000000000000000000\"\n```\n",
