  "description": "Imagine you are watching a variation upon the challenge 'Knock Knock' from the cult Japanese game show Takeshi's Castle - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxMIKXeuNIE\" target=\"_blank\">link here.</a>\n\nIn this version, contestants must navigate their way through a series of walls, each of which has a certain number of doors, each painted with a single letter or digit. If any of the doors show a character that was also shown in the previous set, then that door will be open. Otherwise, it will be locked.\n\nIf there is no shared character between the current set of doors and the previous set, then the contestant must climb over the wall.\n\nYou hatch a devious plan, and decide to write a function that will process the course, returning a special code that future contestants may purchase in order to navigate the course as quickly as possible... very immoral, I know.\n\n<img src=\"https://thumbs.gfycat.com/TintedJointHen-max-1mb.gif\">\n\nSo:\n\nYou will be passed a string of random values, where each value represents a set of doors, and each character a door. E.g ``` \"uy6uq lhh105 tuzpwjus nc1a2 p6v7md cpyp p69hq2b8c 3a9k9r1aq\" ```\n\nThe first value represents the beginning of the course, so simply log an exclamation mark.\n\nFrom there, if a value shares a single character with the previous value, then log that character.\n\nIn the case that there are more than one characters in common (e.g ``` \"fr7og goat7\" ```), then log the shared character that appears first in the current value - if the current value is ```\"goat7\"```, preceded by ```\"fr7og\"```, then log ```\"g\"```, and NOT ```\"o\"``` or ```\"7\"```.\n\nIf there is no shared character between the values, then log a caret, ```\"^\"```, in order to show the contestant climbing over the wall.\n\nYour function should return an unspaced string of the logged characters. For example:\n\n``` javascript\n  knockKnock(\"uy6uq lhh105 tuzpwjus nc1a2 p6v7md cpyp p69hq2b8c 3a9k9r1aq\");\n  should return \"!^^^^pp9\"\n```\n\nNotes: \n\nThe number of doors in each wall will be random.\n\nThe number of walls will also be random. \n\nEach value will always be alphanumeric.\n\nAll letters will be lower-case.",
