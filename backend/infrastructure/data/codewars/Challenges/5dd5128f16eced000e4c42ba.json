  "description": "In this Kata, you will be given a string and your task is to return the most valuable character. The value of a character is the difference between the index of its last occurrence and the index of its first occurrence. Return the character that has the highest value. If there is a tie, return the alphabetically lowest character. `[For Golang return rune]`\n\nAll inputs will be lower case. \n\n```\nFor example:\nsolve('a') = 'a'\nsolve('ab') = 'a'. Last occurrence is equal to first occurrence of each character. Return lexicographically lowest.\nsolve(\"axyzxyz\") = 'x'\n```\n\nMore examples in test cases. Good luck!",
