  "description": "You've got a bunch of textual data with embedded phone numbers. Write a function `area_code()` that finds and returns just the area code portion of the phone number.\n```python\n>>> message = \"The supplier's phone number is (555) 867-5309\"\n>>> area_code(message)\n'555'\n```\nThe returned area code should be a string, not a number.\nEvery phone number is formatted like in the example, and the only non-alphanumeric characters in the string are apostrophes `'` or the punctuation used in the phone number.\n",
