  "description": "Everybody knows a little german, right? But remembering the correct articles is a tough job. Write yourself a little helper, that returns the noun with the matching article:\n\n- each noun containing less than 2 vowels has the article \"das\"\n- each noun containing 2/3 vowels has the article \"die\"\n- each noun containing more than 3 vowels has the article \"der\"\n\nCaution: Vowels are \"a,e,i,o,u\". Umlaute (ä ö ü) are also being counted!\n\n(This Kata is a joke, there is no such grammar rule!)",
