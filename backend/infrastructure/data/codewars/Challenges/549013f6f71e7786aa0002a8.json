  "description": "# Source\n\nThis kata is an application of a magic trick. This magic trick is based on a mathematic algorithm: the Zeckendorf theorem:\n\n> Every positive integer can be expressed uniquely as a sum of distinct non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.\n\n\n**Don't be afraid, you don't need to understand the theorem to solve this kata.**\n\n-------------------------\n# Magic Trick Description\n\nHere is how the magic trick work:\n\n1. Ask the spectator to choose a number between 0 and 100 (included)\n2. Give a *special* set of card to the spectator, these cards contains a list of numbers. Here is what the cards look like: [Click](https://blogdemaths.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/cartes-magiques.pdf)\n3. Ask the spectator to give you back only the cards where his number is written on it.\n4. You can guess the number of your spectator\n\n-------------------------\n# Magic Trick Explanation\n\nYou just need to sum the first number on each card and TADAM. In practice you could ask numbers much higher (with 10 cards it can go up to 231) but that would make really long cards.\n\n-------------------------\n# Objective\n\nWe will consider that each presented card has an \"index\" on it to recognize it. Those cards are already given to you. Write a class magicZ with 2 functions ```gueZZ([indexes of card])``` and ```getMagicZindex(n)```.\n\n- ```gueZZ(indexes)``` takes an array being the index of each card and return the guessed number\n- ```getMagicZindex(n)``` takes a number and return the list of indexes for this value (the number can be higher than 100)\n\n\n## Example:\nI chose number 70:\n\n- ```gueZZ([1,5,8]) === 70```\n- ```getMagicZindex(70) = [1,5,8]```\n\n## Note\nThe spectator is always going to try to trick. Be prepared to receive duplicated cards (ignore the duplicates) or fewer cards than expected (respond with 0).\n\n\nGood Luck, Don't forget to up vote if you like, thanks\n\n*IVBakker*",
