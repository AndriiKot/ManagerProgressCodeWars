  "description": "### self_converge\n`Goal`: Given a number (with a minimum of 3 digits), return the number of iterations it takes to arrive at a derived number that converges on to itself, as per the following [Kaprekar][Kaprekar] routine. As a learning exercise, come up with a solution that uses recursion. The\nfollowing steps would be applicable to a number that originally had\nexactly 4 digits.\n\n0. Initialize a counter to count the number of iterations\n1. Take any four-digit number `n`, using at least two different digits.\n2. Arrange the digits in descending and then in ascending order to get two four-digit numbers, adding leading zeros if necessary. \n    - Add as many zeroes so that the width of the original number is maintained.\n3. Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. Let us call this `nseq`.\n4. Check if `nseq` (the remainder) from Step 4 equals the previous value of `n`. If not, increment the iteration counter and go back to step 2 and perform it on the `nseq`. \n\nIf the number of digits to start with was more than 4, convergence occurs on to a `cycle` of numbers. Therefore in Step 5, detect this cycle by comparing to not only the previous value, but to all previous values of `n`.\n  - If there is a match, then return the count of iterations\n  - If the sequence_number collapses to zero, then return -1 \n\n[Kaprekar]: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KaprekarRoutine.html\n\n### Converge values  \nWhile 3-digit numbers converge to the same unique number `k` which is also 3 digits long, all 4-digit numbers also converge to the same unique value `k1` which is 4 digits long. However, 5 digit numbers converge to any one of the following values: `53955, 59994, 61974, 62964, 63954, 71973, 74943, 75933, 82962, 83952`.\n\n### Example\n`1234`  ->   `4`\n```\n1. 4321 - 1234 =  3087 /   \n2. 8730 - 378  =  8352 /   \n3. 8532 - 2358 =  6174 /   \n4. 7641 - 1467 =  6174 // same as previous\n```\n`414` -> `5`\n```\n1. 441 - 144 =  297 /   \n2. 972 - 279 =  693 /   \n3. 963 - 369 =  594 /\n4. 954 - 459 =  495 /\n5. 954 - 459 =  495 // same as previous\n```\n`50000` -> `4`\n```\n1. 50000 - 5      =  49995 /   \n2. 99954 - 45999  =  53955 /  # first \n3. 95553 - 35559  =  59994 /\n4. 99954 - 45999  =  53955 /  # 2nd time\n```\n",
