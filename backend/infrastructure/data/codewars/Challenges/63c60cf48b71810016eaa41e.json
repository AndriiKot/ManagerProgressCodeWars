  "description": "Cardwars is a new digital trading card game.\n\nThe creator needs you to help implement some of the functionality for their game. In this Kata, you will create a function which takes two cards and returns the state of those cards at the end of a fight between them.\n\nCards have two properties; power and toughness. \nThese are represented as a list of two integers like so: `[power, toughness]`.\n\nA fight between two cards works like this:\n\n1) Each card's `toughness` is reduced by the other card's `power`\n2) If either card's toughness is equal to or below zero the fight is over. Else, repeat until it is.\n\nYou must implement the function `fight(card_a, card_b)` which accepts two cards and returns a tuple of the state of those two cards after they have fought.\n\nThere are also some special rules to consider:\n\n - A card's toughness cannot be below zero; if a card's toughness is reduced below zero it should be set to zero before being returned.\n\n - A fight may get stuck in a loop (if, for example, both cards have zero power). If a fight is in a state where it will never resolve the cards should be returned in that state.\n \n - With respect to the rule above, it is not acceptable to simply try a certain number of iterations and break out if the fight is not finished. Very long fights that will still resolve should do so.\n\n**Example fight:**\n\n```\nmy_big_rat = [1,4]\nyour_small_dog = [2,3]\nfight(my_big_rat,your_small_dog)\n```\n|Round|My \"Big Rat\" card|Your \"Small Dog\" card|\n|---|---|---|\n|Init.|`[1 , 4]`|`[2 , 3]`|\n|1|`[1 , 4-2=2]`|`[2 , 3-1=2]`|\n|2|`[1 , 2-2=0]`|`[2 , 2-1=1]`|\n|End|`[1,0]`|`[2,1]`|\nTherefore the function should return `([1,0],[2,1])`\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n- All inputs will be in a valid format\n- No card's power will be less than 0\n- No card's initial toughness will be less than 1",
