  "description": "There are many word games that can help to make our minds more agile.\nMany TV programs, in different countries, use them as entertainment for the audience.\n\nLorraine had tried to win one of them many times but she was not successful in her attempts. The TV contest is as follows:\n\n- The TV show host gives a random caller a scrambled word (that is incomprehensible) and by rearranging those letters they have to discover a word that is in the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\n\n- They have only 25 seconds to discover the word.\n\nHer friend Bruce obtained the list of 2000, frequently used, English words used by the TV show.\n\nHelp Lorraine by making a function that will give her a list of all valid words that may be obtained by rearranging the scrambled word.\nThere always be at least one valid word for each test case.\n\nLet's see some test cases:\n```python \nunscramble(\"shi\") == ['his']\n\nunscramble(\"nowk\") == ['know']\n\nunscramble(\"amle\") == ['male', 'meal']\n```\nThe list of words that Bruce obtained (keep the secret!) is named ```word_list```, in ruby ```$word_list``` and javascript ```wordList```.\nFor words with more than six letters we have a challenge with speed.\nTry to create a suitable memoized data structure for fast hashing using the provided ```word_list```.\n\nRemember that all the words will correspond to U.K. English (Oxford Dictionary).",
