  "description": "In the board game Talisman, when two players enter combat the outcome is decided by a combat score, equal to the players power plus any modifiers plus the roll of a standard 1-6 dice. The player with the highest combat score wins and the opposing player loses a life. In the case of a tie combat ends with neither player losing a life.\n\nFor example:\n```\nPlayer 1: 5 Power, 0 Modifier\nPlayer 2: 3 Power, 2 Modifier\n\nPlayer 1 rolls a 4, Player 2 rolls a 2.\n\n(5 + 0 + 4) -> (3 + 2 + 2)\nPlayer 1 wins (9 > 7)\n```\n\nYour task is to write a method that calculates the required roll for the player to win.\n\nThe player and enemy stats are given as an array in the format:\n```ruby\n[power, modifier]\n```\n```python\n[power, modifier]\n```\n```javascript\n[power, modifier]\n```\n\nFor example for the examples used above the stats would be given as:\n```ruby\nget_requirements([5, 0], [3, 2]) # returns 'Random'\n```\n```python\nget_required([5, 0], [3, 2]) # returns 'Random'\n```\n```javascript\ngetRequired([5, 0], [3, 2]) // returns 'Random'\n```\n\nIf the player has at least 6 more power (including modifiers) than the enemy they automatically wins the fight, as the enemy's combat score couldn't possibly exceed the player's. In this instance the method should return \"Auto-win\".\n\nFor example:\n```ruby\nget_requirements([9, 0], [2, 1]) # returns 'Auto-win' as the enemy can't possibly win\n```\n```python\nget_required([9, 0], [2, 1]) # returns 'Auto-win' as the enemy can't possibly win\n```\n```javascript\ngetRequired([9, 0], [2, 1]) // returns 'Auto-win' as the enemy can't possibly win\n```\n\nIf the enemy has at least 6 more power (including modifiers) than the player they automatically wins the fight, as the player's combat score couldn't possibly exceed the enemy's. In this instance the method should return \"Auto-lose\".\n\nFor example:\n```ruby\nget_requirements([2, 1], [9, 0]) # returns 'Auto-lose' as the player can't possibly win\n```\n```python\nget_required([2, 1], [9, 0]) # returns 'Auto-lose' as the player can't possibly win\n```\n```javascript\ngetRequired([2, 1], [9, 0]) // returns 'Auto-lose' as the player can't possibly win\n```\n\nIf the player and enemy have the same power (including modifiers) the outcome is purely down to the dice roll, and hence would be considered completely random. In this instance the method should return \"Random\".\n\nFor example (as above):\n```ruby\nget_requirements([5, 0], [3, 2]) # returns 'Random' as it is purely down to the dice roll\n```\n```python\nget_required([5, 0], [3, 2]) # returns 'Random' as it is purely down to the dice roll\n```\n```javascript\ngetRequired([5, 0], [3, 2]) // returns 'Random' as it is purely down to the dice roll\n```\n\nIf the player has greater power than the enemy (including modifiers) the player could guarantee a win by rolling a high enough number on the dice. In this instance the method should return a range equal to the numbers which would guarantee victory for the player.\n\n```ruby\nget_requirements([6, 0], [2, 2]) # returns (5..6) as rolling a 5 or 6 would mean the enemy could not win\nget_requirements([7, 1], [2, 2]) # returns (3..6) as rolling anything 3 through 6 would mean the enemy could not win\n```\n```python\nget_required([6, 0], [2, 2]) # returns '(5..6)' as rolling a 5 or 6 would mean the enemy could not win\nget_required([7, 1], [2, 2]) # returns '(3..6)' as rolling anything 3 through 6 would mean the enemy could not win\n```\n```javascript\ngetRequired([6, 0], [2, 2]) // returns '(5..6)' as rolling a 5 or 6 would mean the enemy could not win\ngetRequired([7, 1], [2, 2]) // returns '(3..6)' as rolling anything 3 through 6 would mean the enemy could not win\n```\n\nIf the player has less power than the enemy (including modifiers) the player can only win if the enemy rolls a low enough number, providing they then roll a high enough number. In this instance the method should return a range equal to the numbers which would allow the player a chance to win.\n\n```ruby\nget_requirements([4, 0], [6, 0]) # returns (1..3) as this would be the only outcome for which the player could still win\nget_requirements([1, 1], [6, 0]) # returns (1..1) as this would be the only outcome for which the player could still win\n```\n```python\nget_required([4, 0], [6, 0]) # returns '(1..3)' as this would be the only outcome for which the player could still win\nget_required([1, 1], [6, 0]) # returns '(1..1)' as this would be the only outcome for which the player could still win\n```\n```javascript\ngetRequired([4, 0], [6, 0]) // returns '(1..3)' as this would be the only outcome for which the player could still win\ngetRequired([1, 1], [6, 0]) // returns '(1..1)' as this would be the only outcome for which the player could still win\n```\n\nIf the better case scenario for the player is to hope for a tie, then return `\"Pray for a tie!\"`.\n\n```ruby\nget_requirements([7, 2], [6, 8]) # returns \"Pray for a tie!\"\n```\n```python\nget_required([7, 2], [6, 8]) # returns \"Pray for a tie!\"\n```\n```javascript\ngetRequired([7, 2], [6, 8]) // returns \"Pray for a tie!\"\n```\n",
