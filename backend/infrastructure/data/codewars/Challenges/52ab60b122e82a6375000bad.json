That's the order Santa wanted his reindeer...right? What do you mean he wants them in order by their last names!? Looks like we need your help Code Warrior!\n\n### Sort Santa's Reindeer\n\nWrite a function that accepts a sequence of Reindeer names, and returns a sequence with the Reindeer names sorted by their last names.\n\n### Notes:\n\n* It's guaranteed that each string is composed of two words, separated by a single space\n* In case of two identical last names, keep the original order\n\n### Examples\n\nFor this input:\n\n```\n[\n  \"Dasher Tonoyan\", \n  \"Dancer Moore\", \n  \"Prancer Chua\", \n  \"Vixen Hall\", \n  \"Comet Karavani\",        \n  \"Cupid Foroutan\", \n  \"Donder Jonker\", \n  \"Blitzen Claus\"\n]\n```\n\nYou should return this output:\n\n```\n[\n  \"Prancer Chua\",\n  \"Blitzen Claus\",\n  \"Cupid Foroutan\", \n  \"Vixen Hall\", \n  \"Donder Jonker\", \n  \"Comet Karavani\",\n  \"Dancer Moore\", \n  \"Dasher Tonoyan\",\n]\n```",
