  "description": "### Task:\n\nYour job is to take a pair of parametric equations, passed in as strings, and convert them into a single rectangular equation by eliminating the parameter. Both parametric halves will represent linear equations of x as a function of time and y as a function of time respectively. \n\nThe format of the final equation must be `Ax + By = C` or `Ax - By = C` where A and B must be positive and A, B, and C are integers. The final equation also needs to have the lowest possible whole coefficients. Omit coefficients equal to one.\n\nThe method is called `para_to_rect` or `EquationsManager.paraToRect` and takes in two strings in the form `x = at +(or -) b` and `y = ct +(or -) d` respectively, where `a` and `c` must be integers, and `b` and `d` must be positive integers. If `a` or `c` is omitted, the coefficient of _t_ is obviously assumed to be 1 (see final case in the example tests). There will NEVER be double signs in the equations inputted (For example: `\"x = -12t + -18\"` and `\"y = -12t - -18\"` won't show up.)\n\n### Example 1\n\n    \"x = 12t + 18\", \"y = 8t + 7\" => \"2x - 3y = 15\"\n\n    CALCULATION:\n        x = 12t + 18  \n        y = 8t + 7  \n        2x = 24t + 36  \n        3y = 24t + 21  \n        2x - 3y = (24t + 36) - (24t + 21)  \n        2x - 3y = 15  \n\n\n### Example 2\n\n    \"x = -12t - 18\", \"y = 8t + 7\" => \"2x + 3y = -15\"\n    \n    CALCULATION:\n        x = -12t - 18  \n        y = 8t + 7  \n        2x = -24t - 36  \n        3y = 24t + 21  \n        2x + 3y = (-24t - 36) + (24t + 21)  \n        2x + 3y = -15  \n\n\n### Example 3\n\n    \"x = -t + 12\", \"y = 12t - 1\" => \"12x + y = 143\"\n    \n    CALCULATION:\n        x = -t + 12  \n        y = 12t - 1  \n        12x = -12t + 144  \n        y   = 12t  - 1  \n        12x + y = 143  \n\n### Note\n\nAs you can see above, sometimes you'll need to add the two parametric equations after multiplying by the necessary values; sometimes you'll need to subtract them – just get rid of the _t_!",
