  "description": "The aim of this kata is to write function ```drawACross``` / ```draw_a_cross``` which returns a cross shape with 'x' characters on a square grid of size and height of our sole input n. All non-'x' characters in the grid should be filled with a space character (\" \").\n\nFor example for ```drawACross(7)``` / ```draw_a_cross(7)```, the function should draw the following grid:\n\n```javascript\nx     x\n x   x \n  x x  \n   x   \n  x x  \n x   x \nx     x\n```\n\nThe arms of the cross must only intersect through one central 'x' character, and start in the corner of the grid, so for even values of n, return ```\"Centered cross not possible!\"```\n\nIf n<3, function should return ```\"Not possible to draw cross for grids less than 3x3!\"```\n",
