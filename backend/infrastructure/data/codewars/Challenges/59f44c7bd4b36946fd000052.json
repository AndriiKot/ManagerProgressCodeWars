  "description": "In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. The printer uses colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to z (except letters `u`, `w`, `x` or `z` that are for errors).\n\nThe colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a control string would be `aaabbbbhaijjjm` meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a... and so on.\n\nSometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a control string is produced e.g. `uuaaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwxym` where errors are reported with letters `u`, `w`, `x` or `z`.\n\nYou have to write a function `hist` which given a string will output the errors as a string representing a histogram of the encountered errors.\n\nFormat of the output string:\n\nletter (error letters are sorted in alphabetical order) in a field of 2 characters, a white space, number of error for that letter in a field of 6, as many \"*\" as the number of errors for that letter and \"\\r\" (or \"\\n\" depending on the langauge).\n\nThe string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from `a` to `z`.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```\ns=\"uuaaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwxym\"\nhist(s) => \"u  2     **\\rw  5     *****\\rx  2     **\"\n```\n*or with dots to see white spaces:*\n```\nhist(s) => \"u..2.....**\\rw..5.....*****\\rx..2.....**\"\ns=\"uuaaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwxymzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz\"\nhist(s) => \"u..2.....**\\rw..5.....*****\\rx..2.....**\\rz..31....*******************************\"\n```\n#### Notes\n\n- Unfortunately most often Codewars compresses all white spaces into one.\n- See other examples in the \"Sample tests\".\n\n",
