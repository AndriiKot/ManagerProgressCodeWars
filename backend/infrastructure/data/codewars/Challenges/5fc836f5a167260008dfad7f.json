  "description": "In this Kata your task is to check the possibility to solve the 'Knight's tour problem' for the desk of the current size.\n\nA knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move away from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed; otherwise, it is open.\n\nIn this Kata we will think only about open tours.\n\n## Input\n\n`n`, `m` - desk size.\n\n`0 < n < 10.`\n\n`0 < m < 10.`\n\n## Output\n\n``` if:python\nReturn `True` if a tour exist for the current desk. Otherwise return `False`.\n```\n```if-not:python\nReturn `true` if a tour exist for the current desk.\nOtherwise return `false`\n```\n",
