  "description": "# Can Santa save Christmas?\n\nOh no! Santa's little elves are sick this year. He has to distribute the presents on his own.\n\nBut he has only 24 hours left. Can he do it?\n\n## Your Task:\n\nYou will get an array as input with time durations as string in the following format: `HH:MM:SS`. Each duration represents the time taken by Santa to deliver a present. Determine whether he can do it in 24 hours or not.\nIn case the time required to deliver all of the presents is exactly 24 hours, Santa can complete the delivery ;-) .\n___\n\nIf this kata was to easy for you.
