  "description": "## Task\n\nThere are three lifts in a building: A, B and C. Lift A only stays on the odd floor; Lift B only stays on the even floor(floor1 is an exception); Lift C stays on each floor. When someone presses the lift button, the nearest lift will move to the person's floor.\n\nNow, someone pressed the lift button, please judge which lift will move?\n\nYou will coding in function ```switchLift```. parameter 1: object ```status```, contains three number values, it means the current floor of the three lifts; parameter 2: number ```n```, it means lift button has been pressed at floor n. The return value should be a string, such as ```\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"```.\n\nThe following examples will help you to understand how to solve this kata.\n  \n## Examples\n\n```\nswitchLift({A:1,B:1,C:10},3) should return \"A\"\n```\nBecause lift A needs move up 2 floor; lift B never stay on floor 3;\nlift C needs move down 7 floor. So the lift A is the best choice.\n```\nswitchLift({A:1,B:1,C:10},4) should return \"B\"\nswitchLift({A:1,B:1,C:10},5) should return \"A\"\nswitchLift({A:1,B:1,C:10},6) should return \"C\"\n\nswitchLift({A:1,B:1,C:9},5) should return \"AC\"\n```\nBecause lift A and lift C both need move 4 floor. \nSo lift A and lift C  will move at the same time.\n```\nswitchLift({A:1,B:2,C:10},6) should return \"BC\"\n\nswitchLift({A:1,B:1,C:9},1) should return \"\"\n```\nBecause there are two lifts have been parked there, \nso any lift does not need to move.\n```\nswitchLift({A:5,B:4,C:6},1) should return \"B\"\n```\nWhen n=1, because the three lifts are able to reach the floor 1, so should return the nearest of three lifts.",
