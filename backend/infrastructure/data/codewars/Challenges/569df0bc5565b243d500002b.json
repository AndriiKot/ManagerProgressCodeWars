  "description": "We define a range with two positive integers ```n1``` and ```n2``` and  an integer factor ```k```, ```[n1, n1 + k*n2]```, the bounds of the defined range are included.\n\n\n~~~if:ruby,rust,python\nWe will be given two arrays: ```prime_factors``` and ```digits```.\n```\nprime_factors = [p1, p2, ..., pl] # p1, p2, ... and pl are prime factors \n\ndigits = [d1, d2, ..., dj]  # d1, d2, ..., dj are digits from 0 to 9 included\n\nWe want to find all the numbers, ```mi``` such that: ```n1 ≤ m1 < m2 < ....mi ≤ n1 + k*n2```, and are divisible for all the prime numbers present in ```prime_factors``` and have all the digits present in ```digits```.\n```\n~~~\n~~~if:javascript,d,go\nWe will be given two arrays: ```primeFactors``` and ```digits```.\n```\nprimeFactors = [p1, p2, ..., pl] # p1, p2, ... and pl are prime factors \n\ndigits = [d1, d2, ..., dj]  # d1, d2, ..., dj are digits from 0 to 9 included\n```\n\nWe want to find all the numbers, ```mi``` such that: ```n1 ≤ m1 < m2 < ....mi ≤ n1 + k*n2```, and are divisible for all the prime numbers present in ```primeFactors``` and have all the digits present in ```digits```.\n~~~\n\nLet's see an example showing the function that will solve these challenge.\n```python\nn1 = 30\nn2 = 90\nk = 4\nfactors = [2, 3]\ndigits = [6, 2]\n--> return [126, 162, 216, 246, 264, 276] # result should be a sorted list with the found numbers.\n```\nAn empty list means that the are no numbers that may fulfill the given conditions.\n\n### Range of inputs\n```\n100 <= n1 <= 500,\n\n1000 <= n2 <= 8000\n\n180 <= k <= 2500\n\nPrime factors will be inferior or equal to 31\n```\n\nHappy coding!!",
