  "description": "## Knight vs Bishop\n\nIf you are not familiar with chess game you can learn more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess).\n\nYou will be provided with two object arrays. Each of them contains an integer and a string which represent the positions of the pieces on the chess board (e.g. `[4, \"C\"]` and `[6, \"D\"]`).\n\nImplement a function which returns:\n* `\"Knight\"` if the knight can capture the bishop\n* `\"Bishop\"` if the bishop can capture the knight\n* `\"None\"` if both pieces are safe\n\nCheck the test cases and Happy coding :)",
