  "description": "If `n` is the numerator and `d` the denominator of a fraction, that fraction is defined a (reduced) proper fraction if and only if `GCD(n, d) = 1`.\n\nFor example `5/16` is a proper fraction, while `6/16` is not, as both `6` and `16` are divisible by `2`, thus the fraction can be reduced to `3/8`.\n\nNow, if you consider a given number `d`, how many proper fractions can be built using `d` as a denominator?\n\nFor example, let's assume that `d` is `15`: you can build a total of `8` different proper fractions between `0` and `1` with it: `1/15`, `2/15`, `4/15`, `7/15`, `8/15`, `11/15`, `13/15` and `14/15`.\n\nYou are to write a function that computes how many proper fractions you can build with a given denominator:\n\n```\n1 --> 0\n2 --> 1\n5 --> 4\n15 --> 8\n25 --> 20\n```\n\nBe ready to handle big numbers.\n\nEdit: to be extra precise, the term should be \"reduced\" fractions, thanks to [girianshiido](http://www.codewars.com/users/girianshiido) for pointing this out and sorry for the use of an improper word :)",
