  "description": "In celebration of ABC Kata Solutions' anniversary, we focus on the pillars of an organization: longest-serving and currently active employees. This SQL challenge involves uncovering a hidden code derived from the first letters of the names of the top 5 longest-tenured employees who are still actively contributing to ABC Kata Solutions.\n\nCraft an SQL query to discover a hidden code by summing the ASCII values of the first letters of the last names of the top five oldest (longest-tenured) employees who are still actively contributing to ABC Kata Solutions.\n\nYou have access to an `employees` table in ABC Kata Solutions'database, which includes:\n\n* `id` (integer) - Unique identifier for each employee.\n* `name` (string) - Full name of the employee, formatted as \"firstName lastName\".\n* `joined_date` (date) - The date the employee began their employment with ABC Kata Solutions.\n* `left_date` (date, nullable) - The date the employee ended their employment with ABC Kata Solutions, if applicable.\n\nRequirements:\n\n1) Identify the Top 5 Oldest Current Employees: Find the five employees with the longest tenure at ABC Kata Solutions who are still employed (i.e., their `left_date` is NULL).\n2) Extract the First Letter of the Last Name: From each employee's name, extract the first letter of the last name.\n3) Calculate ASCII Values: Convert these letters to their ASCII values.\n4) Sum the Values: Sum the ASCII values to derive the hidden code.\n5) Present the Result: Display the final sum as `hidden_code`.\n\n##### Notes:\n\n*  Let's assume for this task that there are no employees with the same `joined_date` - tests are written to ensure that no two employees have the same date of join. \n\nFor this sample data:\n\n```\n| id | name             | joined_date | left_date  |\n+----+------------------+-------------+------------+\n| 1  | Bob Anderson     | 2015-04-23  | NULL       |\n| 2  | Alice Brown      | 2016-05-20  | NULL       |\n| 3  | David Chapman    | 2017-06-15  | NULL       |\n| 4  | Charlie Dinklage | 2014-07-30  | NULL       |\n| 5  | Frank Evans      | 2015-08-25  | NULL       |\n| 6  | Eve Fitch        | 2014-06-11  | 2019-10-01 |\n| 7  | Hannah Grimes    | 2014-12-03  | 2020-03-15 |\n| 8  | Grace Hart       | 2018-01-20  | NULL       |\n| 9  | Julia Ingram     | 2019-03-17  | NULL       |\n| 10 | Ian James        | 2020-04-15  | NULL       |\n| 11 | Luna Knox        | 2021-05-22  | NULL       |\n| 12 | Karl Lovegood    | 2022-06-30  | NULL       |\n| 13 | Milo Murphy      | 2023-07-05  | NULL       |\n```\n\nthe desired output is the following:\n\n<table><!----><tr><th>hidden_code</th></tr><tr><td>335</td></tr></table>\n\nFrom the sorted list of those employees who still working at ABC Kata Solutions, the top 5 oldest employees based on their join dates are:\n\n1) Charlie Dinklage (2014-07-30)\n2) Bob Anderson (2015-04-23)\n3) Frank Evans (2015-08-25)\n4) Alice Brown (2016-05-20)\n5) David Chapman (2017-06-15)\n\nWe extract the first letter of each of their last names, and sum the ASCII values of these letters:\n\n`hidden_code` = 68 (D) + 65 (A) + 69 (E) + 66 (B) + 67 (C) = 335\n\nGLHF!",
