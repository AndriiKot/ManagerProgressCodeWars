  "description": "Given a list of lists containing only 1s and 0s, return a new list that differs from list 1 in its first element, list 2 in its second element, list 3 in its 3rd element, and so on.\n\n```\ncantor([[0,0,0],\n        [1,1,1],\n        [0,1,0]]) = [1,0,1]\n\ncantor([[1,0,0],\n        [0,1,0],\n        [0,0,1]]) = [0,0,0]\n```\n\nThe nested list will always be perfectly square. Your solution should be a list containing only 1s and 0s.\n\nSee [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument) for background (if you're interested; it won't help you solve the kata). Obviously this kata is not the same because the lists are not infinite so it doesn't really prove anything -- consider it a tribute...\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n### Encodings\n\npurity: `LetRec`  \nnumEncoding: `Church`  \nexport constructors `nil, cons` and deconstructor `foldl` for your `List` encoding\n~~~",
