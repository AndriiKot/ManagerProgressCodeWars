  "description": "For this challenge you need to create a VIEW. This VIEW is used by a sales store to give out vouches to members who have spent over $1000 in departments that have brought in more than $10000 total ordered by the members id. The VIEW must be called `members_approved_for_voucher` then you must create a SELECT query using the view.\n\n## Tables and relationship below:\n<image src=\"http://i.imgur.com/hkEkGg1.png\">\n\n### resultant table schema\n- id\n- name\n- email\n- total_spending\n\n> NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.",
