  "description": "# Task\n A little boy is studying arithmetics. He has just learned how to add two integers, written one below another, column by column. But he always forgets about the important part - carrying.\n\n Given two integers, find the result which the little boy will get.\n\n# Example\n\n For param1 = 456 and param2 = 1734, the output should be `1180`\n ```\n     456\n    1734\n + ____\n    1180\n```\nThe little boy goes from right to left:\n\n 6 + 4 = 10 but the little boy forgets about 1 and just writes down 0 in the last column\n \n 5 + 3 = 8\n\n 4 + 7 = 11 but the little boy forgets about the leading 1 and just writes down 1 under 4 and 7.\n\n There is no digit in the first number corresponding to the leading digit of the second one, so the little boy imagines that 0 is written before 456. Thus, he gets 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` integer `a`\n\n   A non-negative integer.\n\n   Constraints: 0 ≤ a ≤ 99999.\n\n - `[input]` integer `b`\n\n   A non-negative integer.\n\n   Constraints: 0 ≤ b ≤ 59999.\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\n   The result that the little boy will get.",
