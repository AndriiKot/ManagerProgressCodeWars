  "description": "# Introduction\n\nJohn was rushing to class, but he tripped and fell!\n\nAll of his neat folders have been mixed up, and he needs to sort them!\n\n# Task\n\nGiven the current state of one of the folders, give the element(s) it most likely contained in any order. This process is called finding the ___mode___(s).\n\nFor example: Given the folder [1, 6, 3, 6], you should return [6]. \n\nHere are some more examples:\n```\n[6, 4, 3] -> [6, 4, 3]\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] -> [5]\n[] -> []\n[9, 9, 9] -> [9]\n[1, 2, 1, 2] -> [1, 2]\n```\n\n",
