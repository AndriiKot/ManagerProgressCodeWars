  "description": "We all want to climb the leaderboard. Even given some of the massive scores on there, it's nice to know how close you are...\n\nIn this kata you will be given a username and their score, your score (not your real score) and you need to calculate how many kata you need to complete to *beat* their score, by 1 point exactly.\n\nAs this is the easy version (harder one to folow at some point in the future), let's assume only Beta kata and 8kyu kata are available. Worth 3 and 1 point respectively.\n\nReturn a string in this format: `\"To beat <user>'s score, I must complete <x> Beta kata and <y> 8kyu kata.\"`\n\nIf the total number of kata you need to complete >1000, add `\"Dammit!\"` to the end of the string, like so: `\"To beat <user>'s score, I must complete <x> Beta kata and <y> 8kyu kata. Dammit!\"`\n\nIf your score is higher than the user's already, return `\"Winning!\"` and if they are equal, return `\"Only need one!\"`\n\n**Note:** You are looking to complete as few kata as possible to get to your target.",
