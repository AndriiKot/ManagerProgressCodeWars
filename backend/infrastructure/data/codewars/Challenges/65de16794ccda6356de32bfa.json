  "description": "Well known Fibonacci sequence have interesting property - if you take every Fibonacci number modulo n, eventually they will form cycle. \nFor example, if n = 5, {F_k mod 5} is \t\n```C#\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 1, 4, 0, 4, 4, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 4, 1, 0, 1, ... \n```\nLength of this cycle called Pisano period. You can read more about it properties on [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisano_period) and [here](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/essays683/renault.html).\n\nYour task is to calculate Pisano period for given number n.\n\nSize of numbers will not exceed 64 bits. Note, that naive approach will definitely fail on this one.\nThere is also [easier version](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5f1360c4bc96870019803ae2) of same task.\n\n```if:python\nRestrictions : gmp2, numpy, scipy, os, pip are not allowed.\n```\n\n```if:javascript\nRestrictions : require is disabled.\n```\n\n```if:cpp\nNote : as C++ lacks big integers, you are provided with two utility functions `uint64_t addmod(uint64_t a, uint64_t b, uint64_t m)` and\n`uint64_t mulmod(uint64_t a, uint64_t b, uint64_t m)`\nthat compute respectively `(a+b)%m` and `(a*b)%m` without overflows.\n```\n",
