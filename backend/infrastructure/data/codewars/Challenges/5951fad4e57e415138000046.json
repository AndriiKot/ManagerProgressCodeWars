  "description": "# Task\n\nA company has produced a new product with a quantity of `n`. There are many customers who want to buy the product. An integer array `customerQuotation` contains the expected price of all the customers.\n\nTo be fair, the company wants to sell the product at a fixed price, according to the rules:\n\n```\n1. All customers whose expected price to be above or equal to the price \n   can buy a product at this price.\n2. If the quantity of the product is not enough, some customers will\n   automatically lose their qualifications \n   (you can simply understand that if only 5 products are available,\n   but 6 customers are eligible to buy, then, at most only 5 customers \n   will buy it, and no need to consider who is eligible to buy it)\n3. The company can get the maximum sales amount;\n4. On the premise of rule above, let more people can buy products.\n   For example, If there are two ways: \n   Sell 3 products at $10, \n   Or \n   Sell 1 product at $30. \n   We will choose the price of $10.\n```\n\nYour job is to help the company determine the selling price.\n\n# Example\n\nFor `n = 5, customerQuotation = [2,8,10,7]`, the output should be `7`.\n\nThree customers can buy the product at $7, 7 x 3 = 21.\n\nFor `n = 5, customerQuotation = [2,8,10,7,100]`, the output should be `100`.\n\nOne customer can buy the product at $100.\n\nFor `n = 5, customerQuotation = [2,8,10,7,8,10,7,8,10,7]`, the output should be `8`.\n\nFive customers can buy the product at $8, 8 x 5 = 40. Note that there are only 5 products, so only 5 customers can buy the products(not 6 customers).\n\n\n",
