  "description": "### Introduction\n\nPrime number `p` is safe prime if number `(p - 1) / 2` is also prime.\n\nConsider all residues `x` modulo `n`, for which `gcd(x, n) = 1`. This set is called **multiplicative group of residues modulo `n`**.\n\nIn certain cases that group is cyclic (in prime modulo case, for example), which means it generated by powers of some element.\n\n### Task\n\nYour task is to find the smallest generator of multiplicative group of residues, if given modulus is safe prime. Otherwise return `-1`.\n\nModulus will not exceed `128` bits.\n\n> There is more [general version](https://www.codewars.com/kata/66213f334bcd48257fcaf166) of this problem.\n\n```if:javascript\n### Restrictions\n- *require* is not allowed and most builtins are frozen.\n```",
