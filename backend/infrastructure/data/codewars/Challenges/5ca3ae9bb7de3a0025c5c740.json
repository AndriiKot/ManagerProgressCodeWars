  "description": "We want to define the location `x`, `y` of a `point` on a two-dimensional plane where `x` and `y` are positive integers.\n\nOur definition of such a `point` will return a function (procedure). There are several possible functions to do that.\n\nPossible form of `point`:\n\n```if:racket\n~~~\n(define (point a b)\n  (lambda ...))\n\n(procedure? (point 3 4)) -> #t\n~~~\n```\n```if:python\n~~~\ndef point(a, b):\n  return lambda ...\n\ncallable(point(3,4)) -> True\n~~~\n```\n```if:javascript\n~~~\nconst point = (a, b) => {\n  // your code\n};\ntypeof(point(a, b)) === \"function\"\n~~~\n```\n```if:scala\n~~~\npoint(a: Int, b: Int): ...  complete ... {\n  // your code\n};\nThe type of point(a, b) is \"scala.Function...\"\n~~~\n```\n```if:fsharp\n~~~\npoint(a: int, b: int): ...  complete ... =\n  // your code\n\nThe type of point(a, b) is \"System.Func...\"\n~~~\n```\n```if:csharp\n~~~\n... complete with the type of your function ... point(int a, int b) {\n  // your code\n}\nThe type of point(a, b) is \"System.Func...\"\n~~~\n```\n```if:vb\n~~~\nPoint(ByVal a As Integer, ByVal b As Integer) As ... complete ...\n  ' your code\n\nThe type of point(a, b) is \"System.Func...\"\n~~~\n```\n```if:java\n~~~\n... complete with the type of your function ... point(int a, int b) {\n  // your code\n}\nThe return type of point(a, b) is \"java.util.function.Function\"\n~~~\n```\n\nOf course we need to be able to extract from our `point` the two coordinates `x` and `y`.\n\nThe function `fst` must return the first element `x` and our function `snd` must return the second element `y`.\n\nWe will also write a function `sqr-dist` which returns the square of the distance between two points `point1` and `point2`.\n\nLast function to write `line`:\n\nGiven two `points` `foo` and `bar` this function return a list `(l m n)` or `[l, m, n]` where `l, m, n` are the coefficients in \nthe general equation `l*x + m*y + n = 0 (1)` of the straight line through the points `foo` and `bar`.\n\nEquation `k*l*x + k*m*y + k*n = 0` is equivalent to (1) and the tests consider that they define the \"same\" line.\n\n### Examples: See \"Sample Tests\".\n\n ```if:racket\n ~~~\n (define foo (point 3 5))\n (procedure? (point 3 5)) -> #t\n (fst foo) -> 3\n (snd foo) -> 5\n (sqr-dist (point 22 55) (point 75 66)) -> 2930\n (line (point 20 22) (point 29 10)) -> '(12 9 -438) ['(4 3 -146) is a good answer too]\n ~~~\n```\n```if:python\n ~~~\n foo = point(3, 5)\n callable(point(3, 5)) -> True\n fst(foo) -> 3\n snd(foo) -> 5\n sqr-dist(point(22, 55), point(75, 66)) -> 2930\n line(point(20, 22), point(29, 10)) -> [12, 9, -438] ([4, 3, -146] is a good answer too)\n ~~~\n```\n```if:javascript\n ~~~\n foo = point(3, 5)\n typeof(point(3, 5)) === \"function\" -> true\n fst(foo) -> 3\n snd(foo) -> 5\n sqr-dist(point(22, 55), point(75, 66)) -> 2930\n line(point(20, 22), point(29, 10)) -> [12, 9, -438] ([4, 3, -146] is a good answer too)\n ~~~\n```\n\n## Note:\n\n- Please ask before translating: some translations are already written and published when/if the kata is approved.\n",
