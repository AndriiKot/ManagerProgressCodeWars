  "description": "# Task\n Given an array of 2<sup>k</sup> integers (for some integer `k`), perform the following operations until the array contains only one element:\n```\nOn the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc. \niterations (1-based) replace each pair of consecutive elements with their sum;\nOn the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc. \niterations replace each pair of consecutive elements with their product.\n```\nAfter the algorithm has finished, there will be a single element left in the array. Return that element.\n\n# Example\n\n For inputArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], the output should be 186.\n\n We have `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] -> [3, 7, 11, 15] -> [21, 165] -> [186]`, so the answer is 186.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` integer array `arr`\n\n   Constraints: 2<sup>1</sup> ≤ arr.length ≤ 2<sup>5</sup>, -9 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 99.\n\n - `[output]` an integer",
