  "description": "An AI has infected a text with a character!! \n\nThis text is now **fully mutated** to this character.\n\nStarting with the original text, and given a character, return the text once it has been mutated so that all of the characters in the original text have been replaced with the character.\n\n~~~if-not:riscv\nIf the text or the character are empty, return an empty string.  \nThere will never be a case when both are empty as nothing is going on!!\n\n**Note:** The character is a string of length 1 or an empty string.\n~~~\n\n~~~if:riscv\nIf the text is empty, return an empty string.\n~~~\n\n# Example\n\n```\ntext before = \"abc\"\ncharacter   = \"z\"\ntext after  = \"zzz\"\n```\n\n~~~if:riscv\nRISC-V: The function signature is\n\n```c\nvoid contamination(const char *text, char mutation, char *result);\n```\n\nThe function does not have a return value - you should write the mutated string into `result`. You may safely assume that `result` will be large enough to hold the result.\n~~~",
