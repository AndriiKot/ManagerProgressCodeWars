  "description": ">When no more interesting kata can be resolved, I just choose to create the new kata, to solve their own, to enjoy the process  --myjinxin2015 said\n\n# Task\n\nWe have a rectangular cake with some raisins on it:\n\n```\ncake = \n  ........\n  ..o.....\n  ...o....\n  ........\n// o is the raisins\n```\n\nWe need to cut the cake evenly into `n` small rectangular pieces, so that each small cake has `1` raisin. `n` is not an argument, it is the number of raisins contained inside the cake:\n\n```\ncake = \n  ........\n  ..o.....\n  ...o....\n  ........\n \nresult should be an array:\n  [\n     ........\n     ..o.....\n  ,\n     ...o....\n     ........\n  ]\n// In order to clearly show, we omit the quotes and \"\\n\"\n```\n\nIf there is no solution, return an empty array `[]`\n\n\n# Note\n\n- The number of raisins is always more than 1 and less than 10.\n- If there are multiple solutions, select the one with the largest width of the first element of the array. (See also the examples below.)\n- Evenly cut into `n` pieces, meaning the same area. But their shapes can be different. (See also the examples below.)\n- In the result array, the order of pieces is from top to bottom and from left to right (according to the location of the upper left corner).\n- Each piece of cake should be rectangular.\n\n# Examples\n\n### An example of multiple solutions:\n\n```\ncake = \n  .o......\n  ......o.\n  ....o...\n  ..o.....\n\nIn this test case, we can found three solution:\nsolution 1 (horizontal cutting):\n  [\n    .o......  //piece 1\n  ,\n    ......o.  //piece 2\n  ,\n    ....o...  //piece 3\n  ,\n    ..o.....  //piece 4\n  ]\n\nsolution 2 (vertical cutting):\n  [\n    .o  //piece 1\n    ..\n    ..\n    ..\n  ,\n    ..  //piece 2\n    ..\n    ..\n    o.\n  ,\n    ..  //piece 3\n    ..\n    o.\n    ..\n  ,\n    ..  //piece 4\n    o.\n    ..\n    ..\n  ]\n  \nsolution 3 (cross cutting):\n  [\n    .o..  //piece 1\n    ....\n  ,\n    ....  //piece 2\n    ..o.\n  ,\n    ....  //piece 3\n    ..o.\n  ,\n    o...  //piece 4\n    ....   \n  ]\n\nwe need choose solution 1 as result\n```\n\n### An example of different shapes:\n\n```\ncake = \n  .o.o....\n  ........\n  ....o...\n  ........\n  .....o..\n  ........\n\nthe result should be:\n  [\n    .o      //pieces 1\n    ..\n    ..\n    ..\n    ..\n    ..\n  ,\n    .o....  //pieces 2\n    ......\n  ,\n    ..o...  //pieces 3\n    ......\n  ,\n    ...o..  //pieces 4\n    ......   \n  ]\nAlthough they have different shapes, \nthey have the same area(2 x 6 = 12 and 6 x 2 = 12).\n```\n\n### An example of no solution case:\n\n```\ncake = \n  .o.o....\n  .o.o....\n  ........\n  ........\n  ........\n  ........\nthe result should be []\n```\n\nKata may contains bug, please help me to test it, thanks ;-)",
