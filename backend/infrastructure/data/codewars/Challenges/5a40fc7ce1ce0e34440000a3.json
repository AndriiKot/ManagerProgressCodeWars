  "description": "In this kata, we want to discover a small property of numbers. \nWe say that a number is a **dd** number if it contains d occurences of a digit d, (d is in [1,9]).\n\n## Examples\n\n* 664444309 is a **dd** number, as it contains 4 occurences of the number 4\n* 30313, 122 are **dd** numbers as they respectively contain 3 occurences of the number 3, and (1 occurence of the number 1 AND 2 occurences of the number 2)\n* 123109, 0, 56542 are not **dd** numbers\n\n## Task \n\nYour task is to implement a function called `is_dd` (`isDd` in javascript) that takes a **positive** number (type depends on the language) and returns a boolean corresponding to whether the number is a **dd** number or not.",
