  "description": "You are given an array of `n+1` integers `1` through `n`. In addition there is a single duplicate integer.\n\nThe array is unsorted.\n\nAn example valid array would be `[3, 2, 5, 1, 3, 4]`. It has the integers `1` through `5` and `3` is duplicated. `[1, 2, 4, 5, 5]` would not be valid as it is missing `3`.\n\nYou should return the duplicate value as a single integer.",
