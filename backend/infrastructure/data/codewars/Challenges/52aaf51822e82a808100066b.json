  "description": "Isn't it annoying how `\"string\".replace(\"find\", \"replace\");` only replaces the first match of the `find` string? Write a function, `replaceAll(input, find, replace);` that will replace all matches of the given `find` string with the given `replace` string.\n\nThe function will always be called with three strings, so don't worry about validating the arguments.\n\nAs with the original `\"string\".replace(find, replace)`, if `find` is an empty string, it should match _in-between_ each character, effectively inserting `replace` in-between each character, including the start and end of the string. I've given you some tests for this to make it a little clearer.",
