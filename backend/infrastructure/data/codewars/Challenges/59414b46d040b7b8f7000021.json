  "description": "If you like Taco Bell, you will be familiar with their signature doritos locos taco. They're very good.\n\n\nWhy can't everything be a taco? We're going to attempt that here, turning every word we find into the taco bell recipe with each ingredient.\n\n\nWe want to input a word as a string, and return a list representing that word as a taco.\n\n***Key***\n\nall vowels (except 'y') = beef\n\nt = tomato\n\nl = lettuce\n\nc = cheese\n\ng = guacamole\n\ns = salsa\n\n  \n***NOTE***    \nWe do not care about case here. 'S' is therefore equivalent to 's' in our taco.\n  \nIgnore all other letters; we don't want our taco uneccesarily clustered or else it will be too difficult to eat.\n\nNote that no matter what ingredients are passed, our taco will always have a shell.\n\n",
