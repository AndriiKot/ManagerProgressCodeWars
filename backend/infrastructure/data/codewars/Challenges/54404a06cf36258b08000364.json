  "description": "There are 8 balls numbered from 0 to 7. \nSeven of them have the same weight. One is heavier. Your task is to find its number.\n\nYour function ```findBall``` will receive single argument - ```scales``` object. The ```scales``` object contains an internally stored array of 8 elements (indexes 0-7), each having the same value except one, which is greater. It also has a public method named ```getWeight(left, right)``` which takes two arrays of indexes and returns -1, 0, or 1 based on the accumulation of the values found at the indexes passed are heavier, equal, or lighter.\n\n```getWeight``` returns:\n\n```-1``` if **left** pan is heavier\n\n```1``` if **right** pan is heavier\n\n```0``` if both pans weight the same\n\nExamples of ```scales.getWeight()``` usage:\n\n```scales.getWeight([3], [7])``` returns ```-1``` if ball 3 is heavier than ball 7, ```1``` if ball 7 is heavier, or ```0``` i these balls have the same weight.\n\n```scales.getWeight([3, 4], [5, 2])``` returns ```-1``` if weight of balls 3 and 4 is heavier than weight of balls 5 and 2 etc.\n\nSo where's the catch, you may ask. Well - the scales is very old. You can use it only **3 TIMES** before the scale breaks.\n\n``` if:python,ruby,crystal\n**Note** - Use `scales.get_weight()` in the Python, Crystal and Ruby versions.\n```\n``` if:ocaml\n**Note** - Use `scales#get_weight` in the OCaml version.\n```\n\nToo easy ? Too hard ? Try other levels:\n\n* [novice](http://www.codewars.com/kata/544047f0cf362503e000036e)\n* [master](http://www.codewars.com/kata/544034f426bc6adda200000e)",
