  "description": "In the drawing below we have a part of the Pascal's triangle, lines are numbered from **zero** (top).\nThe left diagonal in pale blue with only numbers equal to 1 is diagonal **zero**, then in dark green \n(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) is diagonal 1, then in pale green (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21) is\ndiagonal 2 and so on.\n\nWe want to calculate the sum of the binomial coefficients on a given diagonal.\nThe sum on diagonal 0 is 8 (we'll write it S(7, 0), 7 is the number of the line where we start, \n0 is the number of the diagonal). In the same way S(7, 1) is 28, S(7, 2) is 56.\n\nCan you write a program which calculate S(n, p) where n is the line where we start and p \nis the number of the diagonal?\n\nThe function will take n and p (with always: n > 0, p >= 0, n > p) as parameters and will return the sum.\n\n#### Examples:\n\n```\ndiagonal(20, 3) => 5985\ndiagonal(20, 4) => 20349\n```\n#### Hint:\n\nWhen following a diagonal from top to bottom have a look at the numbers on the diagonal at its right.\n\n#### Ref:\n\nhttp://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinomialCoefficient.html\n\n![alternative text](http://i.imgur.com/eUGaNvIm.jpg)\n",
