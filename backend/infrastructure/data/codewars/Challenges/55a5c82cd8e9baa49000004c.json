  "description": "Complete the function that takes 3 numbers `x, y and k` (where `x ≤ y`), and returns the number of integers within the range `[x..y]` (both ends included) that are divisible by `k`.\n\nMore scientifically:  `{ i : x ≤ i ≤ y, i mod k = 0 }`\n\n\n## Example\n\nGiven ```x = 6, y = 11, k = 2``` the function should return `3`, because there are three numbers divisible by `2` between `6` and `11`: `6, 8, 10`\n\n- **Note**: The test cases are very large. You will need a O(log n) solution or better to pass. (A constant time solution is possible.)",
