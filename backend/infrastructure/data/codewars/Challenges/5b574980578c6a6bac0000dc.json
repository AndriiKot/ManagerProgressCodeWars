  "description": "You are a chess esthete. And you try to find beautiful piece combinations. Given a chess board you want to see how this board will look like by removing each piece, one at a time. \n\n*Note:* after removing a piece, you should put it back to its position, before removing another piece.\n\nAlso, you are a computer nerd. No need to look at the board in real life, you will play around with the first part of [FEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) strings like this: \n`rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR`.\n\n\n\n# Input\nA FEN string\n\n# Expected Output\nA list of FENs\n\n# Example\n```javascript,python\nfen = '2p5/8/k2Q4/8/8/8/8/4K3'\n\n  => [ \n       '8/8/k2Q4/8/8/8/8/4K3',\n       '2p5/8/3Q4/8/8/8/8/4K3',\n       '2p5/8/k7/8/8/8/8/4K3',\n       '2p5/8/k2Q4/8/8/8/8/8'\n     ]\n```\n___\n\nTranslations are appreciated.^^\n\nIf you like matrices take a look at [2D Cellular Neighbourhood](https://www.codewars.com/kata/2d-cellular-neighbourhood)\n\nIf you like puzzles and python take a look at [Rubik's cube](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b3bec086be5d8893000002e)",
