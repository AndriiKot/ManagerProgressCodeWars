  "description": "# Task\n Some phone usage rate may be described as follows:\n\n first minute of a call costs `min1` cents,\n \n each minute from the 2nd up to 10th (inclusive) costs `min2_10` cents\n \n each minute after 10th costs `min11` cents.\n \n You have `s` cents on your account before the call. What is the duration of the longest call (in minutes rounded down to the nearest integer) you can have?\n\n# Example\n\n For min1 = 3, min2_10 = 1, min11 = 2 and s = 20, the output should be\n\n `phoneCall(min1, min2_10, min11, s) === 14`\n\n Here's why:\n\n the first minute costs 3 cents, which leaves you with 20 - 3 = 17 cents;\n \n the total cost of minutes 2 through 10 is 1 * 9 = 9, so you can talk 9 more minutes and still have 17 - 9 = 8 cents;\n \n each next minute costs 2 cents, which means that you can talk 8 / 2 = 4 more minutes.\n \n Thus, the longest call you can make is 1 + 9 + 4 = 14 minutes long.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` integer `min1`\n\n Constraints: 1 ≤ min1 ≤ 10\n\n - `[input]` integer `min2_10`\n\n Constraints: 1 ≤ min2_10 ≤ 10\n\n - `[input]` integer `min11`\n\n Constraints: 1 ≤ min11 ≤ 10\n\n - `[input]` integer `s`\n\n Constraints: 2 ≤ s ≤ 100\n\n - [output] an integer",
