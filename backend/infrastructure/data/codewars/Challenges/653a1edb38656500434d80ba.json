  "description": "Write an SQL query to identify products that:\n\n1) Have at least one other product with the same `product_code` but from a different `group_id`.\n2) For a given `product_code` and `group_id` combination, if multiple entries exist, the output should only return the entry with the highest `product_id`.\n3) If a product has a `product_code` that isn't found in any other `group_id`, then it should not appear in the result set.\n\n`products` table:\n\n1) `product_id` (integer): A unique identifier for each product.\n2) `group_id` (integer): An identifier representing the group to which the product belongs.\n3) `product_code` (varchar): A code assigned to the product. Multiple products, possibly from different groups, can have the same code.\n\nThe desired output should include all the columns of the `products` table. Results should be ordered by `product_code` first in asc order and then by `group_id` in descending order. Thus for this sample dataset:\n\n```\nproduct_id | group_id | product_code\n-----------+----------+--------------\n    1      |    1     |      A\n    2      |    1     |      A \n    3      |    2     |      B\n    4      |    3     |      B\n```    \n    \nthe expected output would be:\n\n```\nproduct_id | group_id | product_code\n-----------+----------+-------------\n    4      |    3     |      B\n    3      |    2     |      B\n```\n\n\nGLHF!\n\n\n\n\n\n",
