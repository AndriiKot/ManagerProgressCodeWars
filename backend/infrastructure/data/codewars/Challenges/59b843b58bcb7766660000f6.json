  "description": "An acrostic is a text in which the first letter of each line spells out a word. It is also a quick and cheap way of writing a poem for somebody, as exemplified below :\n\n<a href='http://treasuredpoem.com/Acrostic-Poem.html'><img src='http://treasuredpoem.com/images/cynthia_acrostic.jpg'></a>\n\nWrite a program that reads an acrostic to identify the \"hidden\" word. Specifically, your program will receive a list of words (reprensenting an acrostic) and will need to return a <code>string</code> corresponding to the word that is spelled out by taking the first letter of each word in the acrostic.",
