  "description": "# Centered pentagonal number\n\nComplete the function that takes an integer and calculates how many dots exist in a pentagonal shape around the center dot on the Nth iteration.\n\nIn the image below you can see the first iteration is only a single dot. On the second, there are 6 dots. On the third, there are 16 dots, and on the fourth there are 31 dots.\nThe sequence is: `1, 6, 16, 31...`\n\n![pentagons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Nombre_pentagon_cent.svg)\n  \nIf the input is equal to or less than 0, return `-1`\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n1  -->    1\n2  -->    6\n8  -->  141\n0  -->   -1\n```\n\n```if:python,ruby\n#### Note:\nInput can reach `10**20`\n```\n```if:cpp\n#### Note:\nIn the tests cases n can reach `1358187913`\n```\n```if:c\n#### Note:\nInput numbers can reach `1920767766`; watch out for integer overflow (it is guaranteeed that the result will fit in a `long long`).\n```",
