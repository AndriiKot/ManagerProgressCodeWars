Your task is going to find a pair of numbers(an element in arr1, and another element in arr2), their difference is as big as possible(absolute value); Again, you should to find a pair of numbers, their difference is as small as possible. Return the maximum and minimum difference values by an array: `[  max difference,  min difference  ]`\n\n For example:\n ```\n Given arr1 = [3,10,5], arr2 = [20,7,15,8]\n should return [17,2] because 20 - 3 = 17, 10 - 8 = 2\n ```\n \n# Note:\n - arr1 and arr2 contains only integers(positive, negative or 0);\n - arr1 and arr2 may have different lengths, they always has at least one element;\n - All inputs are valid.\n - This is a simple version, if you want some challenges, [try the challenge version](https://www.codewars.com/kata/583c592928a0c0449d000099).\n \n# Some Examples\n ```\n maxAndMin([3,10,5],[20,7,15,8]) === [17,2]\n maxAndMin([3],[20]) === [17,17]\n maxAndMin([3,10,5],[3,10,5]) === [7,0]\n maxAndMin([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10]) === [9,1]\n ```\n ",
