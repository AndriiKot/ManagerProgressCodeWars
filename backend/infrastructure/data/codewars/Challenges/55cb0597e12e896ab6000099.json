  "description": "In your class, you have started lessons about \"arithmetic progression\". Because you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function.\n\nThis function, arithmetic_sequence_sum(a, r, n), should return the sum of the first (n) elements of a sequence in which each element is the sum of the given integer (a), and a number of occurences of the given integer (r), based on the element's position within the sequence.\n\nFor example:\n\narithmetic_sequence_sum(2, 3, 5) should return 40:\n\n```\n1     2        3          4            5\na + (a+r) + (a+r+r) + (a+r+r+r) + (a+r+r+r+r) \n2 + (2+3) + (2+3+3) + (2+3+3+3) + (2+3+3+3+3) = 40\n```\n",
