  "description": "<h1><u>Gangs</u></h1>\n<p>Your math teacher is proposing a game with divisors, so that you can understand it better. The teacher gives you a <u>list of divisors</u> and a number <u>k</u>. You should find all the gangs in the range 1 to k.</p>\n\n<h4><u>What is a gang?</u></h4>\n<p>The numbers, which have the same subset of divisors from the list, form a gang. The gang can have any number of members. Any number from the range can only be in one gang. You are given the <u>list of divisors</u> as the first argument and the number <u>k</u> as the second argument.</p>\n\n<h4><u>Task</u></h4>\n<p>Find how many gangs can be formed from numbers in range from 1 to k.</p>\n\n<h4><u>Example</u></h4>\n<pre>\nGangs([2, 3], 6)\n=> 4\n\nGangs([2, 3, 6, 5], 15)\n=> 7\n</pre>\n\n\n<h4><u>Explanation</u></h4>\n<p>The first example:<br>\nThe numbers 1 and 5 form a gang because they don't have divisors in [2,3].<br>\nThe 2 and 4 form a gang because they both share the subset [2] from [2,3].<br>\nThe number 3 has subset [3] from [2,3] (forms a gang by itself).<br>\nThe number 6 has subset [2,3] from [2,3] (also forms a gang on its own).<br>\nThus, the numbers 1 through 6 are split into 4 gangs: (1,5), (2,4), (3), (6).</p>\n<p>In the same manner, for second example the gangs are: (1,7,11,13), (2,4,8,14), (3,9), (5), (6,12), (10), (15).</p>",
