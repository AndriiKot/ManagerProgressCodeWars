  "description": "You are a *khm*mad*khm* scientist and you decided to play with electron distribution among atom's shells.\nYou know that basic idea of electron distribution is that electrons should fill a shell until it's holding the maximum number of electrons.\n\n\n  ---\nRules:  \n  - Maximum number of electrons in a shell is distributed with a rule of 2n^2 (n being position of a shell). \n  - For example, maximum number of electrons in 3rd shell is 2*3^2 = 18.\n  - Electrons should fill the lowest level shell first.\n  - If the electrons have completely filled the lowest level shell, the other unoccupied electrons will fill the higher level shell and so on.  \n  ---\n        \n```\nEx.:    atomicNumber(1); should return [1]\n        atomicNumber(10); should return [2, 8]\n        atomicNumber(11); should return [2, 8, 1]\n        atomicNumber(47); should return [2, 8, 18, 19]\n```",
