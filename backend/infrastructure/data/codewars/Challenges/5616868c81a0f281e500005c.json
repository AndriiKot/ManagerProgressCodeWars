  "description": "To participate in a prize draw each one gives his/her firstname. \n\nEach letter of a firstname\nhas a value which is its rank in the English alphabet. `A` and `a` have rank `1`, `B` and `b` rank `2` and so on. \n\nThe *length* of the firstname is added to the *sum* of these ranks hence a number `som`. \n\nAn array of random weights is linked to the firstnames and each `som` is multiplied by its corresponding weight to get what they call a `winning number`.\n\n#### Example:\n```\nnames: \"COLIN,AMANDBA,AMANDAB,CAROL,PauL,JOSEPH\"\nweights: [1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 1]\n\nPauL -> som = length of firstname + 16 + 1 + 21 + 12 = 4 + 50 -> 54\nThe *weight* associated with PauL is 2 so PauL's *winning number* is 54 * 2 = 108.\n```\nNow one can sort the firstnames in *decreasing* order of the `winning numbers`. When two people have the same `winning number` sort them *alphabetically* by their firstnames.\n\n#### Task:\n\n- parameters: `st` a string of firstnames, `we` an array of weights, `n` a rank \n\n- return: the firstname of the participant whose rank is `n` \n(ranks are numbered from 1)\n\n#### Example:\n```\nnames: \"COLIN,AMANDBA,AMANDAB,CAROL,PauL,JOSEPH\"\nweights: [1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 1]\nn: 4\n\nThe function should return: \"PauL\"\n```\n#### Notes:\n- The weight array is at least as long as the number of names, it may be longer.\n\n- If `st` is empty return \"No participants\".\n\n- If n is greater than the number of participants then return \"Not enough participants\".\n\n- See Examples Test Cases for more examples.",
