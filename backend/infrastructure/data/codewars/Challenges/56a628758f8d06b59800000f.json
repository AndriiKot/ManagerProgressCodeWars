  "description": "**A number is self-descriptive when the n'th digit describes the amount n appears in the number.**\n\n**Example:**\n\nFor the number 21200:\n\n- There are two 0's in the number, so the first digit is 2.\n- There is one 1 in the number, so the second digit is 1.\n- There are two 2's in the number, so the third digit is 2.\n- There are no 3's in the number, so the fourth digit is 0.\n- There are no 4's in the number, so the fifth digit is 0.\n\n**Numbers can be of any length up to 9 digits and are only full integers. For a given number, derive a function that returns:**\n- ```True``` if the number is self-descriptive\n- ```False``` if the number is not.",
