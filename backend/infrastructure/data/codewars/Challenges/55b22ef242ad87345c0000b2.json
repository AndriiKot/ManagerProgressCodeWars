  "description": "You may be familiar with the concept of combinations: for example, if you take 5 cards from a 52 cards deck as you would playing poker, you can have a certain number (2,598,960, would you say?) of different combinations.\n\nIn mathematics the number of *k* combinations you can have taking from a set of *n* elements is called the [binomial coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient) of n and k, more popularly called **n choose k**.\n\nThe formula to compute it is relatively simple: `n choose k`==`n!/(k!*(n-k)!)`, where `!` of course denotes the factorial operator.\n\nYou are now to create a choose function that computes the binomial coefficient, like this:\n\n```\nchoose(1,1)==1\nchoose(5,4)==5\nchoose(10,5)==252\nchoose(10,20)==0\nchoose(52,5)==2598960\n```\n\nBe warned: a certain degree of optimization is expected, both to deal with larger numbers precision and computing time.",
