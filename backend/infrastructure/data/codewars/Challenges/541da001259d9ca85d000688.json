  "description": "In this kata, you will write an arithmetic list which is basically a list that contains consecutive terms in the sequence.\n<br />\nYou will be given three parameters :\n\n+ `first` the first term in the sequence\n+ `c` the constant that you are going to <strong>ADD</strong> ( since it is an arithmetic sequence...)\n+ `l` the number of terms that should be `return`ed\n\nUseful link:\n<a href = \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence\">Sequence</a>\n\nBe sure to check out my\n<a href = \"http://www.codewars.com/kata/540f8a19a7d43d24ac001018\">Arithmetic sequence</a> Kata first ;)<br />\nDon't forget about the indexing pitfall ;)",
