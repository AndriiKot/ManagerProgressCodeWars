  "description": "The following code could use a bit of object-oriented artistry. While it's a simple method and works just fine as it is, in a larger system it's best to organize methods into classes/objects. (Or, at least, something similar depending on your language)\n\nRefactor the following code so that it belongs to a Person class/object. Each Person instance will have a greet method. The Person instance should be instantiated with a name so that it no longer has to be passed into each greet method call. \n\nHere is how the final refactored code would be used:\n\n```javascript\nvar joe = new Person('Joe');\njoe.greet('Kate'); // should return 'Hello Kate, my name is Joe'\njoe.name           // should == 'Joe'\n```\n```coffeescript\njoe = new Person('Joe')\njoe.greet('Kate') # should return 'Hello Kate, my name is Joe'\njoe.name          # should == 'Joe'\n```\n```ruby\njoe = Person.new('Joe')\njoe.greet('Kate') # should return 'Hello Kate, my name is Joe'\njoe.name          # should == 'Joe'\n```\n```rust\nlet joe = Person::new(\"Joe\");\njoe.greet(\"Kate\"); // should return \"Hello Kate, my name is Joe\"\njoe.name;          // should == \"Joe\"\n```\n```python\njoe = Person('Joe')\njoe.greet('Kate') # should return 'Hello Kate, my name is Joe'\njoe.name          # should == 'Joe'\n```\n```scala\nval joe = Person(\"Joe\")\njoe.greet(\"Kate\") // should return \"Hello Kate, my name is Joe\"\njoe.name          // should == \"Joe\"\n```",
