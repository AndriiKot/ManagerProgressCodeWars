  "description": "**The Rub**\n\nYou need to make a function that takes an object as an argument, and returns a very similar object but with a special property. The returned object should allow a user to access values by providing only the beginning of the key for the value they want. For example if the given object has a key `idNumber`, you should be able to access its value on the returned object by using a key `idNum` or even simply `id`. `Num` and `Number` shouldn't work because we are only looking for matches at the beginning of a key.\n\nBe aware that you _could_ simply add all these partial keys one by one to the object. However, for the sake of avoiding clutter, we don't want to have a JSON with a bunch of nonsensical keys. Thus, in the random tests there will be a test to check that you did not add or remove any keys from the object passed in or the object returned.\n\nAlso, if a key is tested that appears as the beginning of more than one key in the original object (e.g. if the original object had a key `idNumber` and `idString` and we wanted to test the key `id`) then return the value corresponding with whichever key comes first **alphabetically**. (In this case it would be `idNumber`s value because it comes first alphabetically.)\n\n**Example**\n\n```javascript\nlet o = partialKeys({ abcd: 1 })\n\no.abcd === 1 // true\no.abc === 1 // true\no.ab === 1 // true\no.a === 1 // true\n\no.b === 1 // false!\n\nObject.keys(o) // ['abcd']\n```\n```python\no = partial_keys({\"abcd\": 1})\n\no['abcd'] == 1 # true\no['abc'] == 1 # true\no['ab'] == 1 # true\no['a'] == 1 # true\n\no['b'] == 1 # false!\no['b'] == None # true\n\nlist(o.keys()) # ['abcd']\n```\n```ruby\no = partial_keys({\"abcd\" => 1})\n\no['abcd'] == 1 # true\no['abc'] == 1 # true\no['ab'] == 1 # true\no['a'] == 1 # true\n\no['b'] == 1 # false!\no['b'].nil? # true\n\no.keys # ['abcd']\n```\n",
