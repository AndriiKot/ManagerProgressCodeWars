  "description": "# Task\n When you recently visited your little nephew, he told you a sad story: there's a bully at school who steals his lunch every day, and locks it away in his locker. He also leaves a note with a strange, coded message. \n \n Your nephew gave you one of the notes in hope that you can decipher it for him. And you did: it looks like all the digits in it are replaced with letters and vice versa. `Digit 0 is replaced with 'a', 1 is replaced with 'b' and so on, with digit 9 replaced by 'j'`.\n\n The `note` is different every day, so you decide to write a function that will decipher it for your nephew on an ongoing basis.\n\n# Example\n\n For note = `\"you'll n4v4r 6u4ss 8t: cdja\", `\n \n the output should be `\"you'll never guess it: 2390\"`.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n - `[input]` string `note`\n\n   A string consisting of lowercase English letters, digits, punctuation marks and whitespace characters (' ').\n\n   Constraints: `0 ≤ note.length ≤ 500.`\n\n - `[output]` a string\n\n   The deciphered note.",
