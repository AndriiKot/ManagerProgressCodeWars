  "description": "## Task\n\nYou are given three non negative integers `a`, `b` and `n`, and making an infinite sequence just like fibonacci sequence, use the following rules:\n\n- step 1: use `ab` as the initial sequence.\n- step 2: calculate the sum of the last two digits of the sequence, and append it to the end of sequence.\n- repeat step 2 until you have enough digits\n\nYour task is to complete the function which returns the `n`th digit (0-based) of the sequence.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- `0 <= a, b <= 9`, `0 <= n <= 10^10`\n- `16` fixed testcases\n- `100` random testcases, testing for correctness of solution\n- `100` random testcases, testing for performance of code\n- All inputs are valid.\n- Pay attention to code performance.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nFor `a = 7, b = 8 and n = 9` the output should be `5`, because the sequence is:\n```\n78 -> 7815 -> 78156 -> 7815611 -> 78156112 -> 781561123 -> 7815611235 -> ...\n``` \n\nand the 9th digit of the sequence is `5`.\n\n---\n\nFor `a = 0, b = 0 and n = 100000000` the output should be `0`, because all the digits in this sequence are `0`.\n",
