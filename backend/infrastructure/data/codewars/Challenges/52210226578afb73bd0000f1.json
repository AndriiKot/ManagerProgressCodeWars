  "description": "Have you heard of the game \"electrons around the cores\"? I'm not allowed to give you the complete rules of the game, just so much:\n\n- the game is played with 4 to 6 ___dice___, so you get an array of 4 to 6 numbers, each 1-6\n- the name of the game is important\n- you have to return the correct number five times in a row and your solution is considered to be correct\n\nIf you just press \"submit\", you'll get an array and the expected value!\n\nHere are some input/output pairs for you to wrap your mind around:\n\n- [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] -> 6\n- [ 2, 2, 3, 3 ] -> 4\n- [ 6, 6, 4, 4, 1, 3 ] -> 2\n- [ 3, 5, 3, 5, 4, 2 ] -> 12\n\nAnd yes, it is a shameless copy of a famous game.",
