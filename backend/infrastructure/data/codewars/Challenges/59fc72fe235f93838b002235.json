  "description": "Your task is to implement a function that takes two inputs, `x` and `y`, and returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`.\n\nSimple, right? But you are NOT allowed to use Math.pow();\n\nBoth `x` and `y` will be natural numbers (non-negative integers) in range `0 <= x,y <= 13`.\n\n**Special Case:** For this challenge, `0^0` is defined to be `1`.\n",
