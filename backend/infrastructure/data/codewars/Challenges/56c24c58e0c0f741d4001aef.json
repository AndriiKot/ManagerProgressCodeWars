  "description": "I've hit a few bugs in my Java/Type/Coffee-script  code recently, and I've traced the problem back to the global `isNaN` function I was using. I had expected it to be more discerning, but it's returning true for `undefined` right now.\n\nWrite a function `isReallyNaN` that returns `true` only if passed in an argument that evalutes to `NaN`, and returns `false` otherwise.\n\nAny solution is acceptable!",
