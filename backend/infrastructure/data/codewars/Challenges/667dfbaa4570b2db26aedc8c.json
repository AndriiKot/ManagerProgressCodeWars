  "description": "## Description\n\nYou have clothes international size as text (`xs`, `s`, `xxl`).  \nYour goal is to return European number size as a number from that size.\n\nNotice that there is arbitrary amount of *modifiers* (`x`), excluding `m` size, and input can be any string.\n\n## Linearity\n\nBase size for *medium (`m`)* is `38`.  \n(then, *small (`s`)* is `36`, and *large (`l`)* is `40`)\n\nThe scale is linear; modifier `x` continues that by adding or subtracting `2` from resulting size.\n\n(For sizes where `x` modifier makes total size negative, treat that as OK, and return negative size)\n\n## Invalid cases\n\nFunction should handle wrong/invalid sizes.\n\nValid input has any base size (`s`/`m`/`l`) and any amount of modifiers (`x`) before base size (like `xxl`).  \nNotice that you cannot apply modifier for `m` size, consider that case as invalid!  \nAnything else is disallowed and should be considered as invalid (`None` for Python, `0, false` for Go, `null` for JavaScript).\n\nInvalid examples: `xxx`, `sss`, `xm`, `other string`\n\n## Valid Examples\n\n`xs`: 34  \n`s`: 36  \n`m`: 38  \n`l`: 40  \n`xl`: 42  ",
