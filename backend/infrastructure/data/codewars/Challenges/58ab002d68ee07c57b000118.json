  "description": "# Description\nYour task is to take arrays of numbers and compress them into ranges.\n\nThe numbers in the array are mostly consecutive. If you convert them as ranges, it will save a lot of space. You should write a function that will convert an array of numbers into a string. A range, or series of consecutive numbers, will be represented as two numbers separated by an underscore, a range of one just by the number its self and multiple ranges separated by commas.\n\nFor example,  \nThe numbers 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 would be displayed as \"5_9\"  \nThe number 6 would just be \"6\"  \nThe numbers 3,4,5,6,9 would be \"3_6,9\"  \n\nUsing the above system, you should write two functions:  \ntoRange - convert an array of numbers to a range string  \ntoArray - convert a range string back to an array  \n\n## Warnings\nThe numbers could arrive all jumbled up so you'll need to sort them\nSometimes the same number may appear more than once, duplicates should be discarded.\n\n## Edge cases\nAn empty array should become an empty string if passed to `toRange` and vise versa for the `toArray` function. Also, ranges of 2 digits will take the same space whether they are represented as a sequence or a range. I.e. `\"5,6,8,9\".length === \"5_6,8_9\".length` so there will be no compression, but represent them as a range anyway for consistency.\n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you're finding this Kata a little hard, then maybe try my other one first\n\nhttps://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-first-non-consecutive-number\n",
