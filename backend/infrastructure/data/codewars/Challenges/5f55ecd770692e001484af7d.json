  "description": "## Too long, didn't read\n\nYou get a list of integers, and you have to write a function `mirror` that returns the \"mirror\" (or symmetric) version of this list: i.e. the middle element is the greatest, then the next greatest on both sides, then the next greatest, and so on...\n\n\n## More info\n\nThe list will always consist of integers in range `-1000..1000` and will vary in size between 0 and 10000. Your function **should not mutate the input** array, and this will be tested (where applicable). Notice that the returned list will always be of odd size, since there will always be a definitive middle element.\n## Examples\n\n```\n[]  -->  []\n[1]  -->  [1]\n[2, 1]  -->  [1, 2, 1]\n[1, 3, 2]  -->  [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n[-8, 42, 18, 0, -16]  -->  [-16, -8, 0, 18, 42, 18, 0, -8, -16]\n[-3, 15, 8, -1, 7, -1] --> [-3, -1, -1, 7, 8, 15, 8, 7, -1, -1, -3]\n[-5, 10, 8, 10, 2, -3, 10] --> [-5, -3, 2, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 8, 2, -3, -5]\n```\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n~~~if:c\n## For C language:\n* do not allocate memory for the return value\n* assign ints to the provided pointer `*result`\n\nDue to these details, the function should not return anything, so the signature will look like this: \n```c\nvoid mirror(const int *data, size_t n, int *result)\n```\nwhere `data` is, of course, an input array (though technically its a pointer to an int), `n` is the size of the array and `result` is the array to which you should assign the resulting elements (again, technically a pointer).\n~~~\n",
