  "description": "<h1>Basics - Generators #1</h1>\nGenerators are very useful things in programming, in this series we will learn how to use generators and see how we can apply generators to common programming challenges.\n\n<h2>Task</h2>\nYou must complete the generator function that must increment a counter by 1 each time also if the argument is supplied (will always be a number) you must then change the counter to that number.\n\n<h2>Important</h2>\nThe counter must start at 1 when the generator is initialized\n\n<strong>More Info: </strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators\">Iterators and Generators (JavaScript)</a>, [Generators Overview (PHP)](http://php.net/manual/en/language.generators.overview.php)",
