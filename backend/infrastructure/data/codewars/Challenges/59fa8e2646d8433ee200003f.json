  "description": "In this kata you're expected to sort an array of 32-bit integers in ascending order of the number of **on** bits they have.\n\nE.g Given the array **[7, 6, 15, 8]**\n\n- 7 has **3 on** bits  (000...0**111**)\n- 6 has **2 on** bits  (000...0**11**0)\n- 15 has **4 on** bits (000...**1111**)\n- 8 has **1 on** bit   (000...**1**000)\n\nSo the array in sorted order would be **[8, 6, 7, 15]**.\n\nIn cases where two numbers have the same number of bits, compare their real values instead.\n\nE.g between 10 **(...1010)** and 12 **(...1100)**, they both have the same number of **on** bits '**2**' but the integer 10 is less than 12 so it comes first in sorted order.\n\nYour task is to write a function that takes an array of integers and sort them as described above.\n\n```if-not:haskell\nNote: your solution has to sort the array __in place__.\n```\n\nExample: \n    \n    [3, 8, 3, 6, 5, 7, 9, 1]   =>    [1, 8, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9, 7]\n",
