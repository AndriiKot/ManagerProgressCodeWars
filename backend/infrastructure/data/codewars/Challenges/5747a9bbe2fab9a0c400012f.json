  "description": "The four bases found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).\n\nIn genetics, GC-content is the percentage of Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) bases on a DNA molecule that are either guanine or cytosine. \n\nGiven a DNA sequence (a string) return the GC-content in percent.\n\nFor more information about GC-content you can take a look to [wikipedia GC-content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GC-content).\n\n**For example**: the GC-content of the following DNA sequence is 50%:\n\"AAATTTCCCGGG\".\n\n**Note**: You can take a look to my others bio-info kata [here](http://www.codewars.com/users/nbeck/authored)",
