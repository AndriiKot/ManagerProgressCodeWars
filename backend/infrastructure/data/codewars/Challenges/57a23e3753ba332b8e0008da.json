  "description": "In Star Labs we use password system to unlock the lab doors and only Team Flash is given the password for these labs. The password system is made of a `n x n` keypad (`n > 0`).\n\n\nOne day Zoom saw Cisco using the password. He figured out that the password is symmetric about the centre point (the centre point for a `n x n` keypad will be the point with co-ordinates `(n / 2, n / 2)`). Now he has to try all possible symmetric combinations to unlock the door. Since he does not have enough time, he asks you to determine whether a given password is symmetric or not.\n\n\nYou will be given a flattened `n x n` binary grid containing elements as `0` if that key is not used and `1` if that key is used. You need to tell whether the given binary grid is symmetric according to the centre point. The grid might not be square; in that case you should return `\"No\"`.\n\n\n\n## Your Task\n\nWrite a function that takes an one-dimensional array of integers containing `0` and `1` as input and returning `\"Yes\"` or `\"No\"` depending on whether the given password is symmetric or not.\n\n## Examples\n\n* ```\n  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1] => \"Yes\"\n  ```\n\n  The given password is symmetric about the centre point. For ease of understanding, the above 1D array can be represented as follows:\n  ```\n  1  1  0\n  0  0  0\n  0  1  1\n  ```\n\n* ```\n  [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1] => \"No\" \n  ```\n\n  This array cannot be represented as a `n x n` matrix, so it's     invalid.\n\n* ```\n  [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] => \"No\" \n  ```\n\n  This password is not symmetric along the centre point.",
