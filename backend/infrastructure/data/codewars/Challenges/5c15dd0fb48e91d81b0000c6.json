  "description": "# I'm already Tracer\n*Note*: this is an easy Kata, but requires a bit of knowledge about the game Overwatch. Feel free to skip the background section if you are familiar with the game!\n\n# Background\nOverwatch is a team-based online First Person Shooter. Teams are made up of 6 **unique** heroes. No team can have 2 of the same hero. e.g. You can't play Tracer if I'm already Tracer.\n\nHeroes belong to **1 of 3 categories**:\n\n- **Tank**\n  - Tank heroes soak up damage, create space for your team, and break apart fortified positions, like closely-grouped enemies and narrow choke-points. If you’re a tank, you lead the charge.\n- **Damage**\n  - Damage heroes are responsible for seeking out, engaging, and defeating the enemy using their varied tools and abilities. Playing a damage hero means it is your duty to secure kills.\n- **Support**\n  - Support heroes empower their allies by healing them, boosting their damage, and providing vital utility. As support, you’re the backbone of your team’s survival.\n\nhttps://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Template:Heroes\n\n# Challenge:\n```javascript\nteamComp() \n```\n```python\nteam_comp()\n```\nYour goal is to write a function that will tell you your team \"comp\" (composition, i.e. balance of hero categories).\n## Input:\nArray of hero names.\nExample:\n```javascript\n['Reinhardt', 'Torbjörn', 'Mei', 'Pharah', 'Ana', 'Brigitte']\n```\n## Output:\nArray showing # of counts for each hero category. (Team Composition)\nExample:\n```javascript\n[1, 3, 2]  // [(tank), (damage), (support)]\n```\n\n# Helpers\nFeel free to use `TANK`, `DAMAGE`, and `SUPPORT` - preloaded arrays of hero names in alphabetical order. Examples:\n```javascript\nTANK[0]     // D.Va\nDAMAGE[1]   // Bastion\nSUPPORT[2]  // Lúcio\n```\n\n# Invalid Team Composition\nIn the case of an invalid team comp:\n\n- Fewer or greater than 6 heroes\n- A hero appears more than once on the team\n\n... \n```javascript\nthrow new Error('GG');\n```\n```python\nraise InvalidTeam()\n# Note: this exception is defined in the preloaded section,\n# no need to define it yourself!\n```",
