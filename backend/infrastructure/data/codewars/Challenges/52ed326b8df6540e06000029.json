  "description": "There is a house with 4 levels.\nIn that house there is an elevator.\nYou can program this elevator to go up or down,\ndepending on what button the user touches inside the elevator.\n\nValid levels must be only these numbers: `0,1,2,3`\n\nValid buttons must be only these strings: `'0','1','2','3'` \n\nPossible return values are these numbers: `-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3`\n\nIf the elevator is on the ground floor(0th level) \nand the user touches button '2'\nthe elevator must go 2 levels up,\nso our function must return 2.\n\nIf the elevator is on the 3rd level\nand the user touches button '0'\nthe elevator must go 3 levels down, so our function must return -3.\n\nIf the elevator is on the 2nd level,\nand the user touches button '2'\nthe elevator must remain on the same level,\nso we return 0.\n\nWe cannot endanger the lives of our passengers, \nso if we get erronous inputs, \nour elevator must remain on the same level.\nSo for example:\n\n- `goto(2,'4')` must return 0, because there is no button '4' in the elevator.\n- `goto(4,'0')` must return 0, because there is no level 4.\n- `goto(3,undefined)` must return 0.\n- `goto(undefined,'2')` must return 0.\n- `goto([],'2')` must return 0 because the type of the input level is array instead of a number.\n- `goto(3,{})` must return 0 because the type of the input button is object instead of a string.",
