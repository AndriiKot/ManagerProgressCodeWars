  "description": "It's time to assess which of the world's greatest fighters are through to the 6 coveted places in the semi-finals of the Street Fighter World Fighting Championship. Every fight of the year has been recorded and each fighter's wins and losses need to be added up.\n\nEach row of the table ```fighters``` records, alongside the fighter's name, whether they won (1) or lost (0), as well as the type of move that ended the bout.\n\n* id\n* name \n* won\n* lost\n* move_id\n\nwinning_moves\n\n* id\n* move\n\nHowever, due to new health and safety regulations, all ki blasts have been outlawed as a potential fire hazard. Any bout that ended with ```Hadoken, Shouoken``` or ```Kikoken``` should not be counted in the total wins and losses.\n\nSo, your job:\n\n* Return ```name, won,``` and ```lost``` columns displaying the name, total number of wins and total number of losses. Group by the fighter's name.\n* Do not count any wins or losses where the winning move was ```Hadoken, Shouoken``` or ```Kikoken```.\n* Order from most-wins to least\n* Return the top 6. Don't worry about ties.",
