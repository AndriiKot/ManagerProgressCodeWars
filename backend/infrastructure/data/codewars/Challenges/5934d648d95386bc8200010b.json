  "description": "# Introduction \n\nKa ka ka cypher is a cypher used by small children in some country. When a girl wants to pass something to the other girls and there are some boys nearby, she can use Ka cypher. So only the other girls are able to understand her. <br/>\nShe speaks using KA, ie.: <br>\n`ka thi ka s ka bo ka y ka i ka s ka u ka gly` what simply means `this boy is ugly`. <br/>\n\n\n# Task \n\nWrite a function that accepts a string word and returns encoded message using ka cypher. <br/><br/>\nOur rules:<br>\n- The encoded word should start from `ka`.\n- The `ka` goes after vowel (a,e,i,o,u)\n- When there is multiple vowels together, the `ka` goes only after the last `vowel`\n- When the word is finished by a vowel, do not add the `ka` after\n\n# Input/Output\n\nThe `word` string consists of only lowercase and uppercase characters. There is only 1 word to convert - no white spaces.\n\n# Example\n\n```\n\"a\" => \"kaa\"\n\"ka\" => \"kaka\"\n\"aa\" => \"kaaa\"  \n\"Abbaa\" => \"kaAkabbaa\"\n\"maintenance\" => \"kamaikantekanakance\"\n\"Woodie\" => \"kaWookadie\"\n\"Incomprehensibilities\" => \"kaIkancokamprekahekansikabikalikatiekas\"\n```\n\n# Remark\n\nKa cypher's country residents, please don't hate me for simplifying the way how we divide the words into \"syllables\" in the Kata. I don't want to make it too hard for other nations ;-P ",
