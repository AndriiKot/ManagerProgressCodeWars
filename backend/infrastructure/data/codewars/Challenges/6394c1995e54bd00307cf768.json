  "description": "**No French knowledge is needed for this kata!**\n\n*A note for the people who do know French: this kata will skip the step of turning the verb into it's Nous form, to maintain simplicity. That means verbs like Manger will be Mangais, instead of Mangeais. Oh, and no être ;-)*\n\n---\n\n## Details ##\n\n*(You may skip this part)*\n\nWhen speaking/writing French, you use **L’imparfait** *(the imperfect tense)* to describe continuous or habitual actions in the past. \n\nFor example, you would use l'imparfait to translate `\"I was thinking\"`, because thinking is an action that happens over a length of time. You wouldn't use l'imparfait to translate `\"I won the boss battle\"`, as it's an action that happens once. \n\nThink of it as the French equivalent of our Past Progressive.\n\n\n## Task ##\n\nGiven a simple French phrase, consisting of a subject and a verb in its infinitive form, you need to turn it into **L'imparfait**, using the table below. To conjugate a sentence in l'imparfait, drop the last two letters of the verb and replace it with the correct ending based on the subject.\n\nHere are the endings to replace the verb with:\n\n| Subject                          | Verb Ending |\n| -------------------------------- | ----------- |\n| `Je`         *(I)*               | `-ais`      |\n| `Tu`         *(You)*             | `-ais`      |\n| `Il/Elle/On` *(He/She/It or We)* | `-ait`      |\n| `Nous`       *(We)*              | `-ions`     |\n| `Vous`       *(You or Y'all)*    | `-iez`      |\n| `Ils/Elles`  *(They)*            | `-aient`    |\n\nLet's say you want to translate `I was walking` to French: \n1. Take the subject + infinitive: `Je marcher`\n2. Remove the last two letters: `Je march`\n3. Apply the correct ending: `Je marchais`\n\nYou get `Je marchais`, which can be checked with our handy dandy [google translate](https://translate.google.com/?sl=fr&tl=en&text=Je%20marchais&op=translate).\n\n\n## Examples ##\n\n```\nJe manger     -->  Je mangais   \nTu dormir     -->  Tu dormais\nElle coder    -->  Elle codait\nIl livrer     -->  Il livrait\nOn parler     -->  On parlait\nNous aller    -->  Nous allions\nVous partir   -->  Vous partiez\nIls jouer     -->  Ils jouaient\nElles gagner  -->  Elles gagnaient\n```",
