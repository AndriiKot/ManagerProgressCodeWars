  "description": "<p align=\"center\"><font size=5><b>Crazy programmer : find  SuperMan</b></font></p><br>\nHey, young man, don't look around, I'm talking to you!<br><br>\nI am a programmer, work in this madhouse. my job is research code, and... at the same time I am also the other researcher's study object. There are a lot of the same people and work with me. <br><br>\nMy recent research is how to find Superman, because I found that a SuperMan is hidden inside us, we must find him, then let him go to save the planet.<br><br>\nThe conclusion of my research:\n\n```\n1. If a person is talking to you, the word 'Superman' appears in \n   the sentence, so he is not a superman.\n2. Because Superman usually careful to hide the word 'Superman' in \n   a sentence, and each of the two letters are not continuous.\n3. Sometimes Superman will be especially careful, reverse the word,\n   or transform uppercase and lowercase, let others more difficult \n   to find out.   \n```\nNow, I invite you to help me write the code (my hand was injured, there is no way to knock on the keyboard), a function which can correctly find out who is Superman, and let him wear the red pants and cloak, save our earth!<br>\n\n```\noutput is a string, if find out SuperMan, \nsay \"Hi, SuperMan!\" to him,  otherwise, say \"Are you crazy?\"\n```\n\n\nCrazy  programmer series:<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.codewars.com/kata/56d3c1eb3323a88d0a000305\">Crazy programmer 01: find SuperMan</a><br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.codewars.com/kata/56d4eebedf52109fd90019ca\">Crazy programmer 02: Insert advertising code</a><br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.codewars.com/kata/56d52f9901936c8d55000224\">Crazy programmer 03: Must  praise</a><br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.codewars.com/kata/56d66fd6736bd0e02b000057\">Crazy  programmer 04: Elephant and fridge</a>",
