  "description": "Write a function that takes as parameters an array (arr) and 2 integers (x and y). The function should return the mean between the mean of the the first x elements of the array and the mean of the last y elements of the array.\n\nThe mean should be computed if both x and y have values higher than 1 but less or equal to the array's length. Otherwise the function should return -1.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n[1, 3, 2, 4], 2, 3 => should return 2.5\n```\nbecause: the mean of the the first 2 elements of the array is (1+3)/2=2 and the mean of the last 3 elements of the array is (4+2+3)/3=3 so the mean of those 2 means is (2+3)/2=2.5.\n```\n[1, 3, 2, 4], 1, 2 => should return -1\n```\nbecause x is not higher than 1.\n```\n[1, 3, 2, 4], 2, 8 => should return -1\n```\nbecause 8 is higher than the array's length.\n",
