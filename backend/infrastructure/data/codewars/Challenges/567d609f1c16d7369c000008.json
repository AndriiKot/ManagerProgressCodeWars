  "description": "A genetic algorithm is based in groups of chromosomes, called populations. To start our population of chromosomes we need to generate random binary strings with a specified length.\n\nIn this kata you have to implement a function `generate` that receives a `length` and has to return a random binary strign with `length` characters.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/XW7Ys4n.gif)\n\n# Example:\n\nGenerate a chromosome with length of 4 `generate(4)` could return the chromosome `0010`, `1110`, `1111`... or any of `2^4` possibilities.\n\n***Note:*** *Some tests are random. If you think your algorithm is correct but the result fails, trying again should work.*\n\n# See other katas from this series\n\n  - **Genetic Algorithm Series - #1 Generate**\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #2 Mutation](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-2-mutation)\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #3 Crossover](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-3-crossover)\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #4 Get population and fitnesses](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-4-get-population-and-fitnesses)\n  - [Genetic Algorithm Series - #5 Roulette wheel selection](http://www.codewars.com/kata/genetic-algorithm-series-number-5-roulette-wheel-selection)\n\n*This kata is a piece of [Binary Genetic Algorithm](http://www.codewars.com/kata/526f35b9c103314662000007)*",
