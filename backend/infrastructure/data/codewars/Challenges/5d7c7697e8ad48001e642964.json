  "description": "Speedcubing is the hobby involving solving a variety of twisty puzzles, the most famous being the 3x3x3 puzzle or Rubik's Cube, as quickly as possible.\n\nIn the majority of Speedcubing competitions, a Cuber solves a scrambled cube 5 times, and their result is found by taking the average of the middle 3 solves (ie. the slowest and fastest times are disregarded, and an average is taken of the remaining times).\n\nIn some competitions, the unlikely event of a tie situation is resolved by comparing Cuber's fastest times.\n\nWrite a function ```cube_times(times)``` that, given an array of floats ```times``` returns an array / tuple with the Cuber's result (to 2 decimal places) AND their fastest solve.\n\n\nFor example:\n```python\ncube_times([9.5, 7.6, 11.4, 10.5, 8.1]) = (9.37, 7.6)\n# Because (9.5 + 10.5 + 8.1) / 3 = 9.37 and 7.6 was the fastest solve.\n```\n\n```ruby\ncube_times([9.5, 7.6, 11.4, 10.5, 8.1]) = [9.37, 7.6]\n# Because (9.5 + 10.5 + 8.1) / 3 = 9.37 and 7.6 was the fastest solve.\n```\n\n```javascript\ncubeTimes([9.5, 7.6, 11.4, 10.5, 8.1]) = [9.37, 7.6]\n// Because (9.5 + 10.5 + 8.1) / 3 = 9.37 and 7.6 was the fastest solve.\n```\n\n```typescript\ncubeTimes([9.5, 7.6, 11.4, 10.5, 8.1]) = [9.37, 7.6]\n// Because (9.5 + 10.5 + 8.1) / 3 = 9.37 and 7.6 was the fastest solve.\n```\n\n```julia\ncubetimes([9.5, 7.6, 11.4, 10.5, 8.1]) = (9.37, 7.6)\n# Because (9.5 + 10.5 + 8.1) / 3 = 9.37 and 7.6 was the fastest solve.\n```\n\nNote: ```times``` will always be a valid array of 5 positive floats (representing seconds)",
