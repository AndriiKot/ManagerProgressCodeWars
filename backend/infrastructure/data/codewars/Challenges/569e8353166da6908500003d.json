  "description": "A function receives a certain numbers of integers ```n1, n2, n3 ..., np```(all positive and different from 0) and a factor ```k, k > 0```\n\nThe function rearranges the numbers ```n1, n2, ..., np``` in such order that generates the minimum number concatenating the digits and this number should be divisible by ```k```.\n\nThe order that the function receives their arguments is:\n```python\nrearranger(k, n1, n2, n3,....,np)\n```\n\n~~~if:ruby,python\n## Examples\n```\nrearranger(4, 32, 3, 34, 7, 12)  returns \"Rearrangement: 12, 3, 34, 7, 32 generates: 12334732 divisible by 4\"\n\nrearranger(10, 32, 3, 34, 7, 12) returns \"There is no possible rearrangement\"\n```\nIf there are more than one possible arrangements for the same minimum number, your code should be able to handle those cases:\n\n```\nrearranger(6, 19, 32, 2, 124, 20, 22) returns \"Rearrangements: 124, 19, 20, 2, 22, 32 and 124, 19, 20, 22, 2, 32 generates: 124192022232 divisible by 6\"\n```\n~~~\n~~~if-not:ruby,python\n## Examples (input --> output)\n```\nrearranger(4, 32, 3, 34, 7, 12)  --> \"Rearrangement: 12, 3, 34, 7, 32 generates: 12334732 divisible by 4\"\n\nrearranger(10, 32, 3, 34, 7, 12) --> \"There is no possible rearrangement\"\n```\nIf there are more than one possible arrangements for the same minimum number, your code should be able to handle those cases:\n```\n6, [19, 32, 2, 124, 20, 22] --> \"Rearrangements: 124, 19, 20, 2, 22, 32 and 124, 19, 20, 22, 2, 32 generate: 124192022232 divisible by 6\"\n```\n~~~\nThe arrangements should be in sorted order, as you see: `124, 19, 20, 2, 22, 32` comes first than `124, 19, 20, 22, 2, 32`.\n\nHave an enjoyable time!\n\n(Thanks to `ChristianE.Cooper` for his contribution to this kata)",
