  "description": "Harry's local chicken shop - The Golden Chick - sells chicken pieces in boxes of 3, 6 and 10.\n\nWrite a function that takes the total number of chicken pieces Harry can eat `(n)` and returns an array of the possible numbers of chicken pieces he can buy, that are less than or equal to n. \n\n0 chicken pieces is a valid chicken option.\n\nFor example: Given `n = 9`, the result should be `[0,3,6,9]`, as Harry can buy no boxes, a box of 3, a box of 6, or a box of 3 and a box of 6 (9 in total).\n\nFor non-numeric input, the function should return `[0]`.\n\nDon't forget to rate this kata!",
