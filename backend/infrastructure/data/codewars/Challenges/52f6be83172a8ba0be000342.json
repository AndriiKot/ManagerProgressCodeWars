  "description": "Let's say we have a singly linked list.  \nEmpty list is represented by `null` or equivalent (`nil` in Ruby).  \nNon-empty list is represented by 2-element array `[value, tail]`.\n\nSo for example list with values 1, 2, 3 would be represented as `[1, [2, [3, null]]]`.\n\nYour job is to develop function `reverseList` which returns elements of given list in reverse order without modification of the original list.\n\nP.S. Make sure your solution works on huge lists.",
