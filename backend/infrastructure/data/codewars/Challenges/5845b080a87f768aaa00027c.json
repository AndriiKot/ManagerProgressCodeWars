  "description": "You have an 8x8 grid with coordinates ranging from `1` to `8`. The origin `(1, 1)` is in the top left corner. The bottom right corner is `(8, 8)`.\n\nYou are given a string as an input which will contain the 2 coordinates in this format: `\"(x1 y1)(x2 y2)\"`, where `(x1 y1)` represents point `A` and `(x2 y2)` represents point `B`. In the inputs provided, point `A` will always be up and to the left of point `B`. In other words, `x1 < x2` and `y1 < y2` will be true for every input.\n\nYour goal is to find out the number of different paths you can take to get from point `A` to point `B` by moving one cell at a time either down or right.\n\n## Example\n\nGiven an input of `\"(2 3)(3 5)\"`, the number of possible paths to get from `A` to `B` is 3.\n\n```\n .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n .
