  "description": "# Task\n\nInternational hackers group organized a programming competition, in which `n` teams participated. \n\nThey were assigned to separate rooms for competitions, and the rooms were lined up in a straight line.\n\nThe game was over and each team scored points. It's time to pay bonuses. The rule is:\n```\n- The bonus unit is 1K($1000), and each team gets at least 1k.\n- The bonus payment process is not public. \n- A team can know the bonus amount of its adjacent team, if the \n  score of the adjacent team is lower than itself.\n- If a team finds that its bonus is no higher than the adjacent team whose\n  score is lower than itself, the team will not be satisfied\n```\n\nGiven an integer array `scores` represents the score of all teams. Your task is to calculate how much bonuses international hackers group need to pay to keep all teams satisfied.\n\nNote, the unit of bonus is `1K`. All teams are in a straight line, and their order is the same as that of the array elements.\n\n# Example\n\nFor `scores = [10,20,30]`, the output should be `6`.\n\n```\nteam1's score = 10\nteam2's score = 20\nteam3's score = 30\n\nteam1 can get 1K, The team was satisfied \nbecause it knew nothing about the other teams.\n\nteam2 can know team1's bonus amount, \nSo team2 at least get 2K to be satisfied\n\nteam3 can know team2's bonus amount, \nSo team3 at least get 3K to be satisfied\n\n1 + 2 + 3 = 6\n```\n\nFor `scores = [10,20,20,30]`, the output should be `6`.\n\nThe possible bonus amount of each team can be:`[1,2,1,2]`\n\nFor `scores = [20,30,10,30,40,10,20,30,40,30]`, the output should be `20`.\n\nThe possible bonus amount of each team can be:`[1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1]`",
