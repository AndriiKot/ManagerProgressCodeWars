  "description": "John and his wife Ann have decided to go to Codewars.  On the first day Ann will do one kata and John - he wants to know how it is working - 0 kata.\n\nLet us call `a(n)` - and `j(n)` - the number of katas done by Ann - and John - at day `n`. We have `a(0) = 1` and in the same manner `j(0) = 0`.\n\nThey have chosen the following rules:\n- On day `n` the number of katas done by Ann should be `n` minus the number of katas done by John at day `t`, `t` being equal to the number of katas done\nby Ann herself at day `n - 1`\n\n- On day `n` the number of katas done by John should be `n` minus the number of katas done by Ann at day `t`, `t` being equal to the number of katas done\nby John himself at day `n - 1`\n\nWhoops! I think they need to lay out a little clearer exactly what there're getting themselves into!\n\n\n## Could you write:\n- functions `ann(n)` and `john(n)` that return the **list** of the number of katas Ann/John does on the first `n` days;\n- functions `sum_ann(n)` and `sum_john(n)` that return the **total** number of katas done by Ann/John on the first `n` days\n \n```if:shell,fortran\n#### Note:\nfunctions `ann` and `john` are not tested\n```\n\n## Examples:\n```\njohn(11)  -->  [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\nann(6)    -->  [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]\n\nsum_john(75)  -->  1720\nsum_ann(150)  -->  6930\n```\n\n```if:shell\nshell: sumJohnAndAnn has two parameters ->\n- first one : n (number of days, $1)\n- second one : which($2) ->\n - 1 for getting John's sum\n - 2 for getting Ann's sum.\n\nSee \"Sample Tests\"\n```\n\n#### Note: \n\nKeep an eye on performance.",
