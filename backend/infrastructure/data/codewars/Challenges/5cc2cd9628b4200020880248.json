  "description": "## Number pyramid\n\nNumber pyramid is a recursive structure where each next row is constructed by adding adjacent values of the current row. For example:\n\n```\nRow 1     [1     2     3     4]\nRow 2        [3     5     7]\nRow 3           [8    12]\nRow 4             [20]\n```\n\n___\n\n## Task\n\nGiven the first row of the number pyramid, find the value stored in its last row.\n\n___\n\n## Performance tests\n\n```python\nNumber of tests: 10\nList size: 10,000\n```\n```javascript\nNumber of tests: 5\nArray size: 10,000\n```\n```ruby\nNumber of tests: 10\nArray size: 10,000\n```\n```haskell\nNumber of tests: 5\nList size: 10,000\n```",
