  "description": "### Task\n\nGiven a list of positive integers, determine the **minimum non-negative integer** that needs to be inserted so that the **sum of all elements** becomes a **prime number**.\n\n### Notes\n\n- The list will always have **at least 2 elements**.\n- All elements will be **positive integers** (`n > 0`).\n- The list **may contain duplicate values**.\n- The new sum must be the **closest prime number** that is **greater than or equal to** the current sum.  \n\n### Examples\n\n```\n[3, 1, 2] ==> Should return 1  \nExplanation: The sum is 6\nThe closest prime greater than or equal to 6 is 7\nWe need to add 1 to make the sum 7 (a prime)\n\n[2, 12, 8, 4, 6] ==> Should return 5  \nExplanation: The sum is 32\nThe closest prime greater than or equal to 32 is 37\nWe need to add 5 to make the sum 37 (a prime)\n\n[50, 39, 49, 6, 17, 28] ==> Should return 2  \nExplanation: The sum is 189\nThe closest prime greater than or equal to 189 is 191\nWe need to add 2 to make the sum 191 (a prime)\n```\n\n---\n\nFor more challenges, check out [Playing with Numbers Series](https://www.codewars.com/collections/playing-with-numbers).\n\nEnjoy coding!\n\n- [Playing with Numbers Series](https://www.codewars.com/collections/playing-with-numbers)\n- [Playing With Lists/Arrays Series](https://www.codewars.com/collections/playing-with-lists-slash-arrays)\n- [For More Enjoyable Katas](http://www.codewars.com/users/MrZizoScream/authored)\n",
