  "description": "Lines consisting of characters indicating uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet will be added to the input.\n\nDetermine the maximum number of consecutive characters, among which no two letters from the set of letters N, O and P (taking into account repetitions) are written in a row. Spaces should not be taken into account.(ignore spaces altogether)\n\nTo perform this task, you should write a function.\n\nExample:\n```\nFor the AAANAPOAA string, the answer will be 6. \n'PO' divides our line into two lines and the maximum length will be at the first line.\n```\n\nIf the line is empty, return 0.\n\nIf the string contains a number, return -1.\n\nGood luck!",
