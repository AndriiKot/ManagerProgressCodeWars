  "description": "We have an awesome, custom collection class, *Bag*, which already has implemented an *#each* for traversing its items and *#count* for counting the items. New requirements come in for the project to check arbitrary conditions regarding data inside of a *Bag*.\n\nWe were just about to break out the trusty old *#each* hammer, when we realize there might be an better/easier/cleaner way. Spotting an abstraction waiting to happen, we decide implement a new method, *#every?*, to make sure that every item in a *Bag* matches the condition.\n\nThe *#every?* method needs to receive a block to run some test against every item. If *every* test passes, it returns true. If any of the tests fail, it returns false. Empty bags should pass all tests.\n\nIt also has a shorthand variation for our lazy friends. If you do not pass a block to *#every*, it tests the truthiness of the items themselves.\n\nExamples:\n\n```ruby\nbag = Bag.new(:surefire, :tests)\nbag.every? { true } # => true\nbag.every? { false } # => false\n\nbag = Bag.new(1,2,3,4)\nbag.every? { |num| num > 0 } # => true\nbag.every? { |num| num.odd? } # => false\n\nbag = Bag.new(:code, :wars)\nbag.every? # => true\n\nbag = Bag.new(:cat, :+, :roomba, nil, :profit!)\nbag.every? # => false\n```",
