  "description": "### Task\n\nGiven an array of integers , Find **the maximum product** obtained from multiplying 2 adjacent numbers in the array. Note that the array size is at least 2 and consists a mixture of positive, negative integers and also zeroes.\n\n### Examples\n\n- `[1, 2, 3]` returns `6` because the maximum product is obtained from multiplying `$\\ 2 * 3 = 6 $`\n- `[9, 5, 10, 2, 24, -1, -48]` returns `50` because the maximum product is obtained from multiplying `$\\ 5 * 10 = 50 $`\n- `[-23, 4, -5, 99, -27, 329, -2, 7, -921]` returns `-14` because the maximum product is obtained from multiplying `$\\ -2 * 7 = -14 $`\n\n___\n\n[Playing with Numbers Series](https://www.codewars.com/collections/playing-with-numbers)\n\n[Playing With Lists/Arrays Series](https://www.codewars.com/collections/playing-with-lists-slash-arrays)\n\n[For More Enjoyable Katas](http://www.codewars.com/users/MrZizoScream/authored)",
