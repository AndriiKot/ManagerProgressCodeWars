  "description": "You get an array of arrays.<br>\nIf you sort the arrays by their length, you will see, that their length-values are consecutive.<br>\nBut one array is missing!<br>\n<br><br>\nYou have to write a method, that return the length of the missing array.<br>\n```\nExample:\n[[1, 2], [4, 5, 1, 1], [1], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]] --> 3\n```\n<br>\n\nIf the array of arrays is null/nil or empty, the method should return 0.<br>\n\nWhen an array in the array is null or empty, the method should return 0 too!<br>\nThere will always be a missing element and its length will be always between the given arrays.\n<br><br>\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)<br> \n<br>\nI have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.\n",
