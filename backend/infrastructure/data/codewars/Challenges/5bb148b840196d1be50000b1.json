  "description": "## Intro:\n\nI was doing a coding challenge. It was one of those multi-step challenges. I don't know if my approach was good or bad, but in one of these steps I was writing a function to convert word to numbers. I did it.. eventually, but... I didn't like how it was written. So I thought why not create kata and check how other people do it :) So:\n\n## Task:\n\nYour task is to write the word to number converter. Digits in the number should match letters in the word. Plus generated number should be the **smallest** possible number you can get.\n\n- Words will contain of maximum 10 **distinct** letters, but word can be any length, even longer than 10 characters long.\n- Number can NOT start with `0`\n- ***Same letters*** share the ***same digit*** regardless of case\n- For empty string return `0`\n\n## Examples:\n\n> `\"A\"` -> `1` - OK\n\n> `\"ABA\"` -> `353` - WRONG ( number is OK, but it's not the smallest number )\n\n> `\"ABA\"` -> `333` - WRONG  ( different letters map to same digits )\n\n>`\"ABA\"` -> `357` - WRONG  ( same letters map to different digits )",
