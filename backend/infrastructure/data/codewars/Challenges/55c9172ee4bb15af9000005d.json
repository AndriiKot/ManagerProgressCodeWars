  "description": "We have the following sequence:\n```python\nf(0) = 0\nf(1) = 1\nf(2) = 1\nf(3) = 2\nf(4) = 4;\nf(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + f(n-3) + f(n-4) + f(n-5);\n```\n\nYour task is to give the number of total values for the odd terms of the sequence  up to the n-th term (included). (The number n (of n-th term) will be given as a nonnegative integer)\n\nThe values 1 (one) is the only that is duplicated in the sequence and should be counted only once.\n\nE.g. \n```\ncount_odd_pentaFib(5) -----> 1 # because the terms up to 5 are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8 (only 1 is odd and counted once)\n```\nOther examples:\n```\n count_odd_pentaFib(10) ------> 3 #because the odds terms are: [1, 1, 31, 61] (three different values)\n\ncount_odd_pentaFib(15) ------> 5 # because the odd terms are: [1, 1, 31, 61, 1793, 3525] (five different values)\n```\nGood luck !!\n\n(Your code should be fast. Many moderate high values will be waiting to test it.)",
