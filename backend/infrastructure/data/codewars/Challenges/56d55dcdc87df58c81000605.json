  "description": "# Description\nWrite a function that checks whether a credit card number is correct or not, using the Luhn algorithm.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n\n* From the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, moving left, double the value of every second digit; if the product of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g., 8 × 2 = 16), then sum the digits of the products (e.g., 16: 1 + 6 = 7, 18: 1 + 8 = 9) or alternatively subtract 9 from the product (e.g., 16: 16 - 9 = 7, 18: 18 - 9 = 9).\n* Take the sum of all the digits.\n* If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero) then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; else it is not valid.\n\nThe input is a string with the full credit card number, in groups of 4 digits separated by spaces, i.e. \"1234 5678 9012 3456\"  \nDon´t worry about wrong inputs, they will always be a string with 4 groups of 4 digits each separated by space.\n\n# Examples\n\n* `\"5457 6238 9823 4311\" --> True`\n\n* `\"5457 6238 9323 4311\" --> False`\n\nfor reference check: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm",
