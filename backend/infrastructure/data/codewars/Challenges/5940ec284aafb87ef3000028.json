  "description": "## Welcome to my (amazing) kata!\n\nYou are given a gigantic number to decode.  Each number is a code that alternates in a pattern between encoded text and a smaller, encoded number.  The pattern's length varies with every test, but the alternation between encoded text and an encoded number will always be there.  Following this rule, each number tested begins with encoded text and ends with an encoded number.\n\n## How the encoding works\n\nNow, we should probably review how the string of numbers is formed - considering you have to unform it. So, first, some text is taken, and encoded.  The system of encoding is taking each letter's position in the alphabet and adding 100 to it.  For example, `m` in the real text would be `113` in the code-number.\n\nAfter the text, there is a binary number.  You should convert this number to a normal, base 10 decimal (all of them can be converted into whole, non-negative numbers).\n\nSeparating encoded text and encoded numbers, there is a `98`.  Because the numbers are in binary, the only digits they use are '0' and '1', and each letter of the alphabet, encoded, is between 101-127, all instances of `98` are to indicate a separation between encoded text and encoded numbers.  There may also be a `98` at the very end of the number.\n\nWhen you return your final answer, the text and numbers should always be separated by a comma (`,`)\n\n## Example\n\n```python\ndecode(103115104105123101118119981001098113113113981000) = \"codewars, 18, mmm, 8\"\n```\nThe part of the code until the first `98` can be decoded to `\"codewars\"`.  `10010` is binary for `18`. `113113113` translates to `\"mmm\"`.  And `1000` is binary for `8`.\n\nHere is a visualisation of the example:\n```javascript\n103 115 104 105 123 101 118 119   98   10010   98   113 113 113   98   1000\n c   o   d   e   w   a   r   s     ,     18     ,    m   m   m     ,     8\n```\n\nGood luck!",
