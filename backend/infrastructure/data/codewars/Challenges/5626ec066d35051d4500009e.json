  "description": "Every number may be factored in prime factors.\n\nFor example, the number 18 may be factored by its prime factors ``` 2 ``` and ```3```\n```\n18 = 2 . 3 . 3 = 2 . 3²\n```\nThe sum of the prime factors of 18 is  ```2 + 3 + 3 = 8```\n\nBut some numbers like 70 are divisible by the sum of its prime factors:\n```\n70 = 2 . 5 . 7 # sum of prime factors = 2 + 5 + 7 = 14\nand 70 is a multiple of 14\n```\nOf course that primes would fulfill this property, but is obvious, because the prime decomposition of a number, is the number itself and every number is divisible by iself. That is why we will discard every prime number in the results\n\nWe are interested in collect the integer positive numbers (non primes) that have this property in a certain range ```[a, b]``` (inclusive).\n\nMake the function ```mult_primefactor_sum()```, that receives the values ```a```, ```b``` as limits of the range ```[a, b]``` and ```a < b``` and outputs the sorted list of these numbers.\n\nLet's see some cases:\n```python\nmult_primefactor_sum(10, 100) == [16, 27, 30, 60, 70, 72, 84] \n\nmult_primefactor_sum(1, 60) == [1, 4, 16, 27, 30, 60]\n```\n\n",
