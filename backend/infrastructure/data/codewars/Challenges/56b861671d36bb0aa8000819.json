  "description": "Your task is to ___Reverse and Combine Words___. It's not too difficult, but there are some things you have to consider...\n\n### So what to do?\n\n\nInput: String containing different \"words\" separated by spaces\n\n```\n1. More than one word? Reverse each word and combine first with second, third with fourth and so on...\n   (odd number of words => last one stays alone, but has to be reversed too)\n2. Start it again until there's only one word without spaces\n3. Return your result...\n```\n\n### Some easy examples:\n```\nInput:  \"abc def\"\nOutput: \"cbafed\"\n\nInput:  \"abc def ghi 123\"\nOutput: \"defabc123ghi\"\n\nInput:  \"abc def gh34 434ff 55_eri 123 343\"\nOutput: \"43hgff434cbafed343ire_55321\"\n```\n\nI think it's clear?! First there are some static tests, later on random tests too...\n\n### Hope you have fun! :-)",
