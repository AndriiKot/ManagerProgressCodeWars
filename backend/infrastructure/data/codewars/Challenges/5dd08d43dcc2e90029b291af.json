  "description": "This kata is based on the [Socialist distribution](https://www.codewars.com/kata/socialist-distribution) by GiacomoSorbi. It is advisable to complete it first to grasp the idea, and then move on to this one.\n\n___\n\n## Task\n\nYou will be given a list of numbers representing the people's resources, and an integer - the minimum wealth each person must possess. You have to redistribute the resources among the people in such way that everybody would fulfil the minimum-wealth requirement.\n\nThe redistribution step consists of 2 operations:\n\n* taking 1 unit of the resource from the first richest person in the list\n* giving 1 unit of the resource to the first poorest person in the list\n\nThis process is repeated until everybody hits the minimum required wealth level.\n\n**Note**: there's always enough resources for everybody.\n\n## Example (step by step)\n\n```\ndistribution([4, 7, 2, 8, 8], 5)  ==  [5, 6, 5, 6, 7]\n\n0. [4, 7, 2, 8, 8]\n          +  -\n1. [4, 7, 3, 7, 8]\n          +     -\n2. [4, 7, 4, 7, 7]\n    +  -\n3. [5, 6, 4, 7, 7]\n          +  -\n4. [5, 6, 5, 6, 7]\n```",
