  "description": "# Background:\nIn Japan, a game called Shiritori is played. The rules are simple, a group of people take turns calling out a word whose beginning syllable is the same as the previous player's ending syllable. For example, the first person would say the word ねこ, and the second player must make a word that starts with こ, like　こむぎ. This repeats until a player can not think of a word fast enough or makes a word that ends in ん, because there are no words that begin with ん　in the Japanese language.\n\nEnglish Shiritori has the same principle, with the first and last letters of words. That being said the lose condition is saying a word that doesn't start with the previous word's last letter or not saying a word quick enough. \n\n``` For example: apple -> eggs -> salmon -> nut -> turkey ... ```\n\n\n# Your Task:\nYou will be given a list of strings, a transcript of an English Shiritori match. Your task is to find out if the game ended early, and return a list that contains every valid string until the mistake. If a list is empty return an empty list. If one of the elements is an empty string, that is invalid and should be handled. \n**************************************************************************************\n### Examples:\n\n## All elements valid:\nThe array ```{\"dog\",\"goose\",\"elephant\",\"tiger\",\"rhino\",\"orc\",\"cat\"}```\n\nshould return `{\"dog\",\"goose\",\"elephant\",\"tiger\",\"rhino\",\"orc\",\"cat\"}`\n\n## An invalid element at index 2:\nThe array ``` {\"dog\",\"goose\",\"tiger\",\"cat\", \"elephant\",\"rhino\",\"orc\"} ``` \n\nshould return ``` (\"dog\",\"goose\") ``` \nsince goose ends in `'e'` and tiger starts with `'t'`\n## An invalid empty string at index 2:\nThe array ``` {\"ab\",\"bc\",\"\",\"cd\"} ``` \n\nshould return ``` (\"ab\",\"bc\") ```\n\n## All invalid empty string at index 0:\nThe array ``` {\"\",\"bc\",\"\",\"cd\"} ``` \n\nshould return ``` An Empty List ```\n\n**************************************************************************************\n## Resources:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiritori\n\n###  Notes:\n\n  猫 = ねこ = neko = cat\n  \n  小麦 = こむぎ = komugi = wheat\n\n",
