  "description": "Fans of The Wire will appreciate this one. \nFor those that haven't seen the show, the Barksdale Organization has a simple method for encoding telephone numbers exchanged via pagers: \"Jump to the other side of the 5 on the keypad, and swap 5's and 0's.\"\n\nHere's a keypad for visualization.\n```\n┌───┬───┬───┐\n│ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │\n├───┼───┼───┤\n│ 4 │ 5 │ 6 │\n├───┼───┼───┤\n│ 7 │ 8 │ 9 │\n└───┼───┼───┘\n    │ 0 │\n    └───┘\n```\n\nDetective, we're hot on their trail! We have a big pile of encoded messages here to use as evidence, but it would take way too long to decode by hand. Could you write a program to do this for us?\n\n\nWrite a function called decode(). Given an encoded string of exactly `10` digits, return the actual phone number in string form. Don't worry about input validation, parenthesis, or hyphens.\n",
