  "description": "See the following triangle:\n```\n____________________________________\n 1                                      \n 2   4   2                              \n 3   6   9   6   3                      \n 4   8   12  16  12  8   4             \n 5   10  15  20  25  20  15  10  5   \n ___________________________________\n \n```\nThe **total sum** of the numbers in the triangle, up to the 5th line included, is ```225```, part of it, ```144```, corresponds to the total **sum of the even terms** and ```81``` to the **total sum of the odd terms**.\n\nCreate a function that may output an array (in Haskell, a tuple) with three results for each value of n.\n```\nn  ---->  [total_sum, total_even_sum, total_odd_sum]\n```\n\nOur example will be:\n```\n5  ---->  [225, 144, 81]\n```\n\nFeatures of the random tests:\n```\nnumber of tests = 100\n50 <= n <= 5000\n```\n\nEnjoy it!\n",
