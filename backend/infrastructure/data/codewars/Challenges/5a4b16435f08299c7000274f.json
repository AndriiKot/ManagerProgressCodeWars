  "description": "Complete the function that takes a list of numbers (`nums`), as the only argument to the function. Take each number in the list and *square* it if it is even, or *square root* the number if it is odd. Take this new list and return the *sum* of it, rounded to two decimal places.\n\nThe list will never be empty and will only contain values that are greater than or equal to zero.\n\nGood luck!\n",
