  "description": "#Make them bark\n\nYou have been hired by a dogbreeder to write a program to keep record of his dogs.\n\nYou've already made a constructor `Dog`, so no one has to hardcode every puppy.\n\nThe work seems to be done. It's high time to collect the payment.\n\n..hold on! The dogbreeder says he wont pay you, until he can make every dog object `.bark()`. Even the ones already done with your constructor.\n\"Every dog barks\" he says. He also refuses to rewrite them, lazy as he is.\n\nYou can't even count how much objects that bastard client of yours already made. He has a lot of dogs, and none of them can `.bark()`. \n\nCan you solve this problem, or will you let this client outsmart you for good?\n\n### Practical info:\n\n - The `.bark()` method of a dog should return the string `'Woof!'`.\n\n - The contructor you made (it is preloaded) looks like this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction Dog(name, breed, sex, age){\n    this.name  = name;\n    this.breed = breed;\n    this.sex   = sex;\n    this.age   = age;\n}\n```\n```coffeescript\nclass Dog\n    constructor: (@name, @breed, @sex, @age) ->\n```\n```python\nclass Dog(object):\n    def __init__(self, name, breed, sex, age):\n        self.name  = name\n        self.breed = breed\n        self.sex   = sex\n        self.age   = age\n```\n```ruby\nclass Dog\n  def initialize(name, breed, sex, age)\n     @name = name\n     @breed = breed\n     @sex = sex\n     @age = age\n  end\nend\n```\n```go\ntype Dog struct {\n  Name string\n  Breed string\n  Sex string\n  Age int\n}\n```\n\n>**Hint:** A friend of yours just told you about how javascript handles classes diferently from other programming languages. He couldn't stop ranting about *\"prototypes\"*, or something like that. Maybe that could help you...",
