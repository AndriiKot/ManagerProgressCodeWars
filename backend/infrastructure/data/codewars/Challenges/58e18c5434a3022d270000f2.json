  "description": "My name is State Trooper Mark (_\"skidmark\"_ ) McDingle.\n\nMy job is maintaining 117 miles of the Interstate, keeping it clean and clear of dead varmints.\n\nIt is a serious job and I take my job seriously.\n\nI am the <span style='color:red;font-size:1.5em;'><b>Road-Kill Detective</b></span>\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LYuQtsO.png)\n\nEvery time I find some dead critter I scrape it up and record what type it was in my dead-critter notebook.\n\nMostly I just cruise up and down the interstate and only find a few racoons or the occasional squirrel...\n\nBut recently the road-kill has become much more exotic.\n\nThere must be some illegal private zoo back in the woods with a major security problem.\n\nBut that's none of my business... Anything beyond the fog-line is out of my jurisdiction.\n\n# <span style='color:red'>Evidence</span>\n\nHere are some photos of what I came across last week:\n\n* There was a thing that looked like a `hyena`\n      ==========h===yyyyyy===eeee=n==a========\n\n* a long black and white smudge that probably once was a `penguin`\n      ======pe====nnnnnn=======================n=n=ng====u==iiii=iii==nn========================n=\n\n* and an unlucky `bear` that was hit going the other direction\n      =====r=rrr=rra=====eee======bb====b=======\n\n# <span style='color:red'>Kata Task</span>\n\nEven for a professional like me, the identification of flattened exotic animals is not always easy!\n\nIf it ever happens that I can't find all of the remains, or if there are gaps or other parts that I don't recognise, then I record it as `??` in my dead-critter notebook.\n\nWhat I really need is a program that I can scan my photos into which can give back the correct answer straight away.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n### Input\n\n* `photo` (not null)\n \n### Output\n\n* the detected animal name, or `??` if unknown<span style='color:red'>^</span>\n\n<hr>\n \n<span style='color:red'>^</span> Note: An array/list of all \"known\" animals is preloaded in a variable called `ANIMALS` (refer to the initial solution)\n",
