  "description": "## INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Club Doorman will give you a word. To gain access, you need to provide the right number according to the given word.\n\nEach word contains exactly one pair of consecutive identical letters, such as the `tt` in `lettuce`.\n\nTo determine the number, find the position of the repeated letter in the alphabet (where `a` is `1`, `b` is `2`, ..., `z` is `26`) and multiply it by `3`.\n\n## TASK\n\nImplement a function that takes a word as input and returns the correct number.\n\n## EXAMPLE\n\nFor the word `lettuce`, the repeated letter is `t`, which is the `20th` letter in the alphabet.\n\nThe correct answer is `20 × 3 = 60`.\n\n## NOTE\n\nYou may assume that the given string will\n\n* always contain exactly **one pair of consecutive identical letters**.\n\n* consist only of **lowercase English letters**.\n\n",
