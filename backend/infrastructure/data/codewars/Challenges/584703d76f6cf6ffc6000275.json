  "description": "Given a set of elements (integers or string characters, characters only in RISC-V), where any element may occur more than once, return the number of **nonempty subsets** that do not contain a repeated element.\n\nLet's see with an example:\n\n```\nset numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n```\n\nThe subsets are:\n\n```\n{{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, \n {3,4}, {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,3,4}, {2,3,4}, {1,2,3,4}}\n```\nThere are 15 subsets.  As you can see, the empty set, `{}`, is not counted.\n\nLet's see an example with repetitions of an element:\n\n```\nset letters = {a, b, c, d, d}\n```\n\nThe subsets for this case (including only those that have no repeated elements inside) will be:\n\n```\n{{a}, {b}, {c}, {d}, {a,b}, {a,c}, {a,d}, {b,c}, {b,d},\n {c,d}, {a,b,c}, {a,b,d}, {a,c,d}, {b,c,d}, {a,b,c,d}}\n```\nThere are 15 subsets.\n\nThe function should receive an array as an argument and according to its features output the amount of nonempty subsets that do not contain a repeated element.\n\n```javascript\n[1, 2, 3, 4] --> 15\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd'] --> 15\n```\n\nFeatures of the random tests:\n\n```\nLow Performance Tests: 40\nLength of the arrays between 6 and 15\n\nHigh Performance Tests: 80\nLength of the arrays between 15 and 100 (Python and Ruby) between 15 and 63 (C++) and between 15 and 50 in javascript and Lua\n```\n\nJust do it!",
