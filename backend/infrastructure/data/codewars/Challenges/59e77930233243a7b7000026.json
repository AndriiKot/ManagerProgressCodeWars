  "description": "Take a look at this [pirate game](https://youtu.be/Mc6VA7Q1vXQ).\n\nGive Amaro an array to confirm his logic for the next time, when the number of pirates changes.\n\nKeep in mind that each time the pirates find a treasure, the amount of gold equals to the ```number of pirates * 20```.\n\n**Example:** \n\nIf number of pirates is 2, including Amaro, then array = ```[40, 0]```, So he can keep all of the gold to himself.\n\nIf number of pirates is 3, including Amaro, then array = ```[59, 0, 1]```, and 59 gold is his for the taking.\n\nIf number of pirates is 4, including Amaro, then array =  ```[79, 0, 1, 0]```, and 79 gold is his to take.\n\nIf number of pirates is 5, including Amaro, then array = ```[98, 0, 1, 0, 1]```, and 98 gold is his for the taking.\n\n...\n\n",
