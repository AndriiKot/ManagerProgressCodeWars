  "description": "Santa puts all the presents into the huge sack. In order to let his reindeers rest a bit, he only takes as many reindeers with him as he is required to do. The others may take a nap.\n\nTwo reindeers are always required for the sleigh and Santa himself. Additionally he needs 1 reindeer per 30 presents. As you know, Santa has 8 reindeers in total, so he can deliver up to 180 presents at once (2 reindeers for Santa and the sleigh + 6 reindeers with 30 presents each).\n\nComplete the function `reindeers()`, which takes a number of presents and returns the minimum numbers of required reindeers. If the number of presents is too high, throw an error.\n\n### Examples (input -> output / error)\n\n```\n0 -> 2\n1 -> 3\n30 -> 3\n200 -> throws an error\n```\n",
