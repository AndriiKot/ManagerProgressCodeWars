  "description": "You have access to two tables named top\\_half and bottom\\_half, as follows:\n\n**top\\_half schema**\n* id\n* heads\n* arms\n\n**bottom\\_half schema**\n* id\n* legs\n* tails\n\nYou must return a table with the format as follows:\n\n**output schema**\n* id\n* heads\n* legs\n* arms\n* tails\n* species\n\nThe IDs on the tables match  to make a full monster. For heads, arms, legs and tails you need to draw in the data from each table.\n\nFor the species, if the monster has more heads than arms, more tails than legs, or both, it is a 'BEAST' else it is a 'WEIRDO'. This needs to be captured in the species column.\n\nAll rows should be returned (10).\n\nTests require the use of CASE. Order by species.\n\nPlease use pure SQL, only testing is done in Ruby.",
