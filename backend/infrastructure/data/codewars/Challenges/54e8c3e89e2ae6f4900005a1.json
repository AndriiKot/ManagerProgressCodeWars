  "description": "Your task is to add a new property ```usersAnswer``` to every object in the array ```questions```. The value of ```usersAnswer``` should be set to ```null```. The solution should work for array of any length. \n\nFor example: \n\n```javascript \nvar questions = [{\n    question: \"What's the currency of the USA?\",\n    choices: [\"US dollar\", \"Ruble\", \"Horses\", \"Gold\"],\n    corAnswer: 0\n}, {\n    question: \"Where was the American Declaration of Independence signed?\",\n    choices: [\"Philadelphia\", \"At the bottom\", \"Frankie's Pub\", \"China\"],\n    corAnswer: 0\n}];\n```     \n\nAfter adding the property the result should be:\n```javascript\nvar questions = [{\n    question: \"What's the currency of the USA?\",\n    choices: [\"US dollar\", \"Ruble\", \"Horses\", \"Gold\"],\n    corAnswer: 0,\n    usersAnswer: null\n}, {\n    question: \"Where was the American Declaration of Independence signed?\",\n    choices: [\"Philadelphia\", \"At the bottom\", \"Frankie's pub\", \"China\"],\n    corAnswer: 0,\n    usersAnswer: null\n}];\n``` \n    \n    \nThe `questions` array is already defined for you and is not the same as the one in the example.  \n    \n    \n    \n\n   \n",
