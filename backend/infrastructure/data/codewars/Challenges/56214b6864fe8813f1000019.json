  "description": "## Terminal game bug squashing\n\nYou are creating a text-based terminal version of your favorite board game. In the board game, each turn has six steps that must happen in this order: roll the dice, move, combat, get coins, buy health, and print status.\n\n---\n\nYou are using a library that already has the functions below. Create a function named `main` (`PlayTurn` for C#) that calls the functions in the proper order stated before.\n\n```javascript\n- combat\n- buyHealth\n- getCoins\n- printStatus\n- rollDice\n- move\n```\n```ruby\n- `combat`\n- `buy_health`\n- `get_coins`\n- `print_status`\n- `roll_dice`\n- `move`\n```\n```python\n- `combat`\n- `buy_health`\n- `get_coins`\n- `print_status`\n- `roll_dice`\n- `move`\n```\n```csharp\n- `Combat`\n- `BuyHealth`\n- `GetCoins`\n- `PrintStatus`\n- `RollDice`\n- `Move`\n```\n\nNote: this list only mentions the methods' names, not the order in which they should be called. For the order, refer to the first paragraph.",
