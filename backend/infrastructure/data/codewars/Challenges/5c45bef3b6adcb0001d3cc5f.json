  "description": "A pair of numbers has a unique LCM but a single number can be the LCM of more than one possible\npairs. For example `12` is the LCM of `(1, 12), (2, 12), (3,4)` etc. For a given positive integer N, the number of different integer pairs with LCM is equal to N can be called the LCM cardinality of that number N. In this kata your job is to find out the LCM cardinality of a number.",
