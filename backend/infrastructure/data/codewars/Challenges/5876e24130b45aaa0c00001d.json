  "description": "NOTE: It is recommended you complete [Introduction to Esolangs](https://www.codewars.com/kata/esolang-interpreters-number-1-introduction-to-esolangs-and-my-first-interpreter-ministringfuck/) or [MiniBitFlip](https://www.codewars.com/kata/esolang-minibitflip/) before solving this one.\n<h3>Task:</h3>\nMake an interpreter for an esoteric language called Ticker. Ticker is a descendant of [Tick](https://www.codewars.com/kata/esolang-tick). Your language has the following commands:\n\n`>`: increment the selector by 1\n\n`<`: decrement the selector by 1\n\n`*`: add the ascii value of selected cell to the output tape\n\n`+`: increment selected cell data by 1. If 256, then it is 0\n\n`-`: increment selected cell data by -1. If less than 0, then 255\n\n`/`: set selected cell data to 0\n\n`!`: add new data cell to the end of the array\n\nYou start with selector at `0` and one cell with a value of `0`. If selector goes out of bounds, assume 0 for that cell <b>but do not add it to the memory. If a + or - is being made do not change the value of the assumed cell. It will always stay 0 unless it is added to the memory</b>\n\nIn other words:\n\n```\ndata: start 0 end\nselector:   ^\ndata start 1 2 4 end\nselector:        ^\nAssume that cell is zero.\n```\n\n<h3>Examples:</h3>\nConsider the following program:\n\n```python\n'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/'\n```\n\nIt's output is this:\n\n```python\n'Hello World!'\n```\n\nThis is made just by using 1 data cell.\n\nExample using multiple data cells:\n\n```python\n'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>'\n```\n\nAnd it's output is still:\n\n```python\n'Hello World!'\n```\n\nA more efficient example:\n\n```python\n'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++**!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*<<*>>!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*<<<<*!>>>>>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*'\n```\n\nWhich still returns the classic:\n\n```python\n'Hello World!'\n```\n\nOther characters are ingnored and therefore can serve as comments.\n\nAfter you're done, fell free to make translations and to discuss this kata.",
