  "description": "You're in ancient Greece and giving Philoctetes a hand in preparing a training exercise for Hercules! You've filled a pit with two different ferocious mythical creatures for Hercules to battle!\n\nThe formidable **\"Orthus\"** is a 2 headed dog with 1 tail.  The mighty **\"Hydra\"** has 5 heads and 1 tail. \n\nBefore Hercules goes in, he asks you \"How many of each beast am  I up against!?\".\n\nYou know the total number of heads and the total number of tails, that's the dangerous parts, right? But you didn't consider how many of each beast. \n\n## Task\n\nGiven the number of heads and the number of tails, work out the number of each mythical beast! \n\nThe data is given as two parameters. Your answer should be returned as an array:\n\n```javascript\n VALID ->      [24 , 15]           INVALID ->  \"No solutions\"\n            [Orthus, Hydra]\n```\n```python \n VALID ->      [24 , 15]           INVALID ->  \"No solutions\"\n```\n\n```csharp\n VALID ->      [24 , 15]           INVALID ->  null\n```\n\nIf there aren't any cases for the given amount of heads and tails - return \"No solutions\" or null (C#).\n",
