  "description": "In your class, you have started lessons about [arithmetic progression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression). Since you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function that will return the first `n` elements of the sequence with the given common difference `d` and first element `a`. Note that the difference may be zero!\n\nThe result should be a string of numbers, separated by comma and space.\n\n## Example\n\n```python\n# first element: 1, difference: 2, how many: 5\narithmetic_sequence_elements(1, 2, 5) == \"1, 3, 5, 7, 9\"\n```\n\n~~~if:fortran\n*NOTE: In Fortran, your returned string is* **not** *permitted to contain redundant leading/trailing whitespace.*\n~~~\n~~~if:c\nNote: The returned string will be free'd if non-NULL.\n~~~",
