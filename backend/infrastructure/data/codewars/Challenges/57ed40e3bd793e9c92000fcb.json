When bob can't guess can throw his hands up and declare it with a '?'.\n\nBob's bosses don't trust Bob's ability just yet, so they have paired him with an expert sexer. All of Bob's decisions will be checked against the expert's choices to generate a correctness score.\n\n## Scoring Rules\n* When they agree, he gets 1 point.\n* When they disagree but one has said '?', he gets 0.5 points.\n* When they disagree completely, he gets 0 points.",
