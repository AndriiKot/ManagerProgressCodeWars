  "description": " Given an array of positive integers, replace every element with the least greater element to its right.\n If there is no greater element to its right, replace it with -1. For instance, given the array \n \n `[8, 58, 71, 18, 31, 32, 63, 92, 43, 3, 91, 93, 25, 80, 28]`,\n \n the desired output is \n \n `[18, 63, 80, 25, 32, 43, 80, 93, 80, 25, 93, -1, 28, -1, -1]`.\n\nYour task is to create a function that takes in an array as its argument, manipulates the array as described above, then return the resulting array.\n\nNote: Return a new array, rather than modifying the passed array.\n",
