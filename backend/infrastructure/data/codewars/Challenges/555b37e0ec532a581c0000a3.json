  "description": "**Story**  \nThere is a vault of \"Evil, Inc.\" with a digital lock. Lock gives anyone entering a riddle - to find a number of distinct ways of getting specific number as a sum of a specific number of summands, write this number in given base and sum digits until you recieve a single-digit number. Open the door!  \n  \n**Formal problem**  \n*Input:*  \n`n` is a positive integer from 0 to `long.MaxValue`. `m` is a positive integer from 0 to 20. `b` is an integer from 2 to `short.MaxValue`.  \n*Output:*  \n*Digital root* of a number `N` in base `b` is a limit of a recursive sum of digits of `N`: sum(sum(sum(...(sum(N))...))). For example, digital root of number 4623694 in base 10 can be computed as 4623694->4+6+2+3+6+9+4->34->3+4->7. Digital root of the same number in base 16 is 0x468D4E->4+6+8+13+4+14->0x31->3+1->4.  \n`Kata.Partitions` should return digital root of {a number of different ways `n` can be split into sum of exactly `m` strictly positive integers} in base `b`. \"Different\" means that sums that differ only by order of summands are considered the same. For example, there are two and only two different ways to split 5 in sum of exactly 3 positive integers, namely 3+1+1 and 2+2+1. For another example, a number of different ways 1234 can be split into sum of exactly 5 strictly positive integers is 811663793, so `Kata.Partitions(1234, 5, 6)` should return 3 and `Kata.Partitions(1234, 5, 10)` should return 8.  \n  \n**Notes and hints**  \n-- The kata is strictly more difficult than <a href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/the-millionth-fibonacci-kata'>\"The millionth Fibonacci\"</a>, <a href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/explosive-sum'>\"Explosive sum\"</a> and <a href='http://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-digits-slash-digital-root'>\"Digital root\"</a>. Make sure you know how to solve these.  \n-- The whole deal with digital root is just to avoid using BigInteger-like types (absent in C#). There is no shortcut (that author is aware of) that would make the task significantly easier than computing number of partitions itself.  \n-- Wiki articles that may or may not be of use (in no particular order): <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_%28number_theory%29'>partitions</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring'>fast exponentiation</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation'>recurrence relation</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation'>modulo operation</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication'>matrix multiplication</a>.  \n-- Don't forget that you have time *and* memory limit. Make use of the fact that `m` is small.  \n-- By a common agreement, sum of zero summands is defined and equals zero.  \n  \n**Credits**  \n",
