  "description": "Given two Arrays in which values are the power of each soldier, return true if you survive the attack or false if you perish.\n\n\n**CONDITIONS**\n* Each soldier attacks the opposing soldier in the **same index** of the array. The survivor is the number with the **highest** value.\n  * If the value is the same they both perish\n  * If one of the values is empty(different array lengths) the non-empty value soldier survives.\n* To survive the defending side must have **more** survivors than the attacking side.\n* In case there are the **same number of survivors** in both sides, the winner is the team with the **highest initial attack power**. If the total attack power of both sides is the same return **true**.\n  * The initial attack power is the sum of all the values in each array.\n\n\n**EXAMPLES**\n```\nattackers=[ 1, 3, 5, 7 ]   defenders=[ 2, 4, 6, 8 ]  \n//0 survivors                4 survivors\n//return true\n\n\nattackers=[ 1, 3, 5, 7 ]   defenders=[ 2, 4 ]  \n//2 survivors  (16 damage)   2 survivors (6 damage)\n//return false\n\nattackers=[ 1, 3, 5, 7 ]   defenders=[ 2, 4, 0, 8 ]  \n//1 survivors                3 survivors \n//return true\n\n\n",
