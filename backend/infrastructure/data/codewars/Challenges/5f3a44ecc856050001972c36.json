  "description": "_Note to translators: This Kata is **NOT** accepting any translations to Coq / Lean / Agda due to the huge difference in difficulty between Idris and those languages mentioned. Any translations violating this rule will be rejected without further reason._\n\n***\n\nThis kata was taken from Coq'Art book by Bertot and Casteran (p. 123). \n\nThe goal is to prove that all six propositions are equivalent.\n\n```idris\nPeirce : Type \nPeirce = (a : Type) -> (b : Type) -> ((a -> b) -> a) -> a\n\nExcludedMiddle : Type \nExcludedMiddle = (a : Type) -> Either a (Not a)\n\nDoubleNegationElim : Type \nDoubleNegationElim = (a : Type) -> Not (Not a) -> a \n\nAbsurdity : Type \nAbsurdity = (a : Type) -> (b : Type) -> (Not a -> Not b) -> b -> a \n\nDeMorganNotAndNot : Type \nDeMorganNotAndNot = (a : Type) -> (b : Type) -> Not (Not a, Not b) -> Either a b\n\nImpliesToOr : Type \nImpliesToOr = (a : Type) -> (b : Type) -> (a -> b) -> Either (Not a) b\n```\n\nTo prove these are equivalent, the simplest way is to form a closed loop of the implication relationship. Just like given in the initial solution: \n\n```idris\nproof1 : Peirce -> ExcludedMiddle\nproof2 : ExcludedMiddle -> DoubleNegationElim\nproof3 : DoubleNegationElim -> Absurdity\nproof4 : Absurdity -> DeMorganNotAndNot\nproof5 : DeMorganNotAndNot -> ImpliesToOr\nproof6 : ImpliesToOr -> Peirce\n```\n\nOf course, you could choose any order you prefer to construct proof1~6. For example, if you have already proved `lemma1 : Peirce -> DoubleNegationElim` and `lemma2 : DoubleNegationElim -> ExcludedMiddle`, just write proof1 as: `proof1 = lemma2 . lemma1`. \n\nFare thee well. \n",
