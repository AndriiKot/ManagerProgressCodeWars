  "description": "Prove that the end (last element) of a list does not change, even if we append another list in front. Specifically, your task is to prove the following:\n\n```agda\ninevitable-end : {a : Set} (ys xs : List a) → xs ≢ [] → last (ys ++ xs) ≡ last xs\n```\n\nThis should be fairly straightforward, but of course the proof does not hold if there is no last element! As you may have noticed, you will be provided a proof to ensure this is not the case, but you need to figure out how to use it to make your proof complete. Good luck!",
