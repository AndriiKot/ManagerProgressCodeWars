  "description": "This is a simplified version of [Racing #2: Accelerated Drag Race](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a42c4cf8f27f25c3700009f).\n\nAnna and Bob are good friends, but also rival drag racers.\nBob just got his engine reconditioned and wants to prove that he is the fastest of the two.\n\nIn this kata, you will simulate a drag race between Anna and Bob and determine the winner.\nYou will do this by implementing the function ```dragRace``` (or ```drag_race``` in Python).\n\n*Input*\n\nYou are given the length of the track in meters (```len``` in JavaScript, ```length``` in Python).\nAlso, you are given the two competing cars (```anna``` and ```bob```).\n\nThe cars are Car objects. In JavaScript, they have the following properties.\n```\nspeed        -> the speed of the car in m/s\nreactionTime -> the reaction time of its driver in s\n```\nIn Python, these are the properties of Car objects.\n```\nspeed         -> the speed of the car in m/s\nreaction_time -> the reaction time of its driver in s\n```\nThe reaction time indicates how long it takes before the driver starts to drive after the start of the race.\nFor example if Anna has a reaction time of 1s, and Bob has a reaction time of 2s, Bob starts driving one second later than Anna.\n\nThe cars do not require any time to accelerate to their speed. In other words, the cars go from zero to their speed in literally no time.\n\n*Output*\n\nIf there is no winner, return the string ```It's a draw```.\n\nIf there *is* a winner, return the string ```[name] is the winner```.",
