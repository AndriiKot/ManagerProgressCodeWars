  "description": "Santa is learning programming. And what could be the first program, he wants to write? Yes, the \"Hello world!\" of Christmas: \"Ho Ho Ho!\". He wants to write a function `ho()`, which should have the following return values:\n\n```javascript\nho(); // should return \"Ho!\"\nho(ho()); // should return \"Ho Ho!\"\nho(ho(ho())); // should return \"Ho Ho Ho!\"\n```\n\nUnfortunately he couldn't find any tutorial, which explains, how he could implement that. Can you help him?\n\nRules:\n\n* each call of `ho()` must add a \"Ho\" to the string\n* the \"Ho\"'s must be separated by a space\n* at the end of the string, there must be an exclamation mark (`!`), without a space",
