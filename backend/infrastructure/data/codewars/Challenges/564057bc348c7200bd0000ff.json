  "description": "From Wikipedia:\n\n\"A divisibility rule is a shorthand way of determining whether a given integer is divisible by a fixed divisor without performing the division, usually by examining its digits.\"\n\nWhen you divide the successive powers of `10` by `13` you get the following remainders of the integer divisions:  \n\n`1, 10, 9, 12, 3, 4` because:\n\n```\n10 ^ 0 ->  1 (mod 13)\n10 ^ 1 -> 10 (mod 13)\n10 ^ 2 ->  9 (mod 13)\n10 ^ 3 -> 12 (mod 13)\n10 ^ 4 ->  3 (mod 13)\n10 ^ 5 ->  4 (mod 13)\n```\n\n(For \"mod\" you can see:\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation>)\n\nThen the whole pattern repeats. Hence the following method:\n\nMultiply \n- the *right* most digit of the number with the *left* most number \nin the sequence shown above, \n- the second *right* most digit with the second *left* most digit of the number in the sequence. \n\nThe cycle goes on and you sum all these products. Repeat this process until the sequence of sums is **stationary**.\n\n#### Example:\nWhat is the remainder when `1234567` is divided by `13`?\n```\n7      6     5      4     3     2     1  (digits of 1234567 from the right)\n×      ×     ×      ×     ×     ×     ×  (multiplication)\n1     10     9     12     3     4     1  (the repeating sequence)\n```\nTherefore following the method we get:\n\n``` 7×1 + 6×10 + 5×9 + 4×12 + 3×3 + 2×4 + 1×1 = 178``` \n\nWe repeat the process with the number 178:\n\n`8x1 + 7x10 + 1x9 = 87`\n\nand again with 87:\n\n`7x1 + 8x10 = 87`\n\nFrom now on the sequence is **stationary** (we always get `87`) and the remainder of `1234567` by `13` is \nthe same as the remainder of `87` by `13` ( i.e `9`).\n\n#### Task:\n\nCall `thirt` the function which processes this sequence of operations on an integer `n (>=0)`. `thirt` will return the **stationary** number.\n\n`thirt(1234567)` calculates 178, then 87, then 87 and returns `87`.\n\n`thirt(321)` calculates 48, 48 and returns `48`\n\n",
