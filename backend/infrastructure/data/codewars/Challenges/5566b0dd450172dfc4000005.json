  "description": "As part of this kata, you need to find the length of the sub-array that begins and ends with the specified number.\n\nFor example, if the array `arr` is `[0, -3, 7, 4, 0, 3, 7, 9]`, finding the length of the sub-array that begins and ends with `7`s would return `5`.\n\n~~~if:javascript,python,ruby\nFor sake of simplicity, there will only be numbers (positive or negative) in the supplied array.\n~~~\n~~~if-not:haskell\nIf there are less or more than two occurrences of the number to search for, return `0`.\n~~~\n~~~if:haskell\nIf there are less or more than two occurrences of the number to search for, return `Nothing`.\n~~~\n",
