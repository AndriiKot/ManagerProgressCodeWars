  "description": "Imagine you and your partner start new jobs at a company. You will work x days, and your partner will work y days, randomly assigned within a 5-day workweek.\n\nYou want to know the expected number of shared workdays.\n\nFor example, if both work 5 days, you will share all 5 days. If one works 0 days, there will be no shared workdays.\n\nWrite a function that takes two integers from zero to five and returns the expected number (doesn't need to be an integer) of shared workdays.
