  "description": "You're given a loaded coin with unknown probability `p` of turning up a head when flipping, and you want to know this probability!\n\nYou need to write a function `sample` which, given a function `coin`, estimates its probability of turning up head, up to an absolute error of 1% (1/100). To flip a coin, simply call the function: `coin()`.\n\n*For simplicity, a head is represented as* `true` *while a tail is represented as *`false`.",
