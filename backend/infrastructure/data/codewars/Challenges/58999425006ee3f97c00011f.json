  "description": "Every month, a random number of students take the driving test at Fast & Furious (F&F) Driving School. To pass the test, a student cannot accumulate more than 18 demerit points. \n\nAt the end of the month, F&F wants to calculate the average demerit points accumulated by <b>ONLY</b> the students who have passed, rounded to the nearest integer. \n\nWrite a function which would allow them to do so. If no students passed the test that month, return 'No pass scores registered.'.\n<br></br>\n\n<u>Example:</u>\n\n[10,10,10,18,20,20] --> 12\n\n\n\n",
