  "description": "### Introduction\n\n**The Robber Language** (Rövarspråket) is a Swedish *cant* used by children to mislead people not familiar with the language. It's used by kids in several screenplays created by [Astrid Lindgren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_Lindgren).\n\nThe idea is that every consonant in a sentence is **duplicated**, with an `o` **inserted** in between (`b` becomes `bob`). Vowels are left untouched (`a` remains an `a`). It's quite hard for an untrained ear to understand a conversation encoded in this manner, especially if spoken rapidly.\n\n### Example\nIn this example, the **consonants** `f`, `b` and `r` are modified. The **vowels** `o` and `a` are left untouched.\n```\n'foo bar' => 'fofoo bobaror' (`fof-o-o bob-a-ror`)\n```\n**Note**: The dashes `-` in the example are added for readability and should **not** be included in the output.\n\n### The Assignment\n\n~~~if:c\nYour task is to implement a function `char* robber_encode(const char *sentence, char encoded[256])` which takes in a string `sentence` and writes the result, converted into **robber language**, in the output parameter `encoded` (a pre-allocated character buffer large enough to hold the result). The function returns a pointer to the string `encoded`.\n~~~\n~~~if:python\nYour task is to implement a function `def robber_encode(sentence)` which takes in a string `sentence` and returns the result, converted into **robber language**, as a string.\n~~~\n~~~if:javascript\nYour task is to implement a function `function robberEncode(sentence)` which takes in a string `sentence` and returns the result, converted into **robber language**, as a string.\n~~~\n~~~if:csharp\nYour task is to implement a function `RobberEncode(string sentence)` which takes in a string `sentence` and returns the result, converted into **robber language**, as a string.\n~~~\n\n### Notes\n1. Only **consonants** should be modified; leave all other characters unchanged.\n2. Both **upper** and **lower** case characters will be tested.\n3. The **case** of the `o` character and the neighboring consonants should match (`F => FOF` and `f => fof`).\n4. For the purpose of this kata, a character is considered a **consonant** if it's equal to one of the letters `BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ`.\n                                                       \n### Testing\n\nThe tests will challenge your function with sentences of **length 0-255**, ASCII characters between **32-126** and ***nothing else***.\n\n### Links\nCheck out these links for more information:\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6varspr%C3%A5ket\n",
