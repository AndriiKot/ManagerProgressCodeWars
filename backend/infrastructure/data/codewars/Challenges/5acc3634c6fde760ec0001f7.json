  "description": "This is a problem that involves adding numbers to items in a list. In a list you will have to add the item's remainder when divided by a given divisor to each item.\n\nFor example if the item is 40 and the divisor is 3 you would have to add 1 since 40 minus the closest multiple of 3 which is 39 is 1. So the 40 in the list will become 41. You would have to return the modified list in this problem.\n\nFor this problem you will receive a divisor called `div` as well as simple list of whole numbers called `nums`. Good luck and happy coding.\n\n# Examples\n```python\nnums = [2, 7, 5, 9, 100, 34, 32, 0], div = 3\n  ==>  [4, 8, 7, 9, 101, 35, 34, 0] \n\nnums = [1000, 999, 998, 997], div = 5\n   ==> [1000, 1003, 1001, 999]\n\nnums = [], div = 2\n   ==> []\n```\n\n**Note:** random tests check lists containing up to 10000 elements.",
