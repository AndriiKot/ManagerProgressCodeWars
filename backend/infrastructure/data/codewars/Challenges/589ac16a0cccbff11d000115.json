  "description": "# Task\n Given some points(array `A`) on the same line, determine the minimum number of line segments with length `L` needed to cover all of the given points. A point is covered if it is located inside some segment or on its bounds.\n\n# Example\n\n For `A = [1, 3, 4, 5, 8]` and `L = 3`, the output should be `2`.\n\n Check out the image below for better understanding:\n\n<div style=\"background-color: white\">\n  <img src=\"https://codefightsuserpics.s3.amazonaws.com/tasks/segmentCover/img/example.png?_tm=1474900035857\">\n</div>\n\n For `A = [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]` and `L = 1`, the output should be `3`.\n \n segment1: `1-2`(covered points 1,2), \n \n segment2: `3-4`(covered points 3,4),\n \n segment3: `5-6`(covered point 5)\n\n For `A = [1, 10, 100, 1000]` and `L = 1`, the output should be `4`.\n \n segment1: `1-2`(covered point 1), \n \n segment2: `10-11`(covered point 10),\n \n segment3: `100-101`(covered point 100), \n \n segment4: `1000-1001`(covered point 1000)\n\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer array A\n\n    Array of point coordinates on the line (all points are different).\n\n    Constraints:\n\n    `1 ≤ A.length ≤ 50,`\n\n    `-5000 ≤ A[i] ≤ 5000.`\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `L`\n\n    Segment length, a positive integer.\n\n    Constraints: `1 ≤ L ≤ 100.`\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n \n   The minimum number of line segments that can cover all of the given points.",
