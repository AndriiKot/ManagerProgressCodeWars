  "description": "You stumble upon a genie who offers you a single wish. Being a food enthusiast, you wish for the opportunity to experience all the food at your favorite tapas restaurant. However, the genie has a twist in store and traps you in a time loop, destined to repeat the same evening until you've experienced every possible combination of dishes within a specified price range.\n\nObjective: Calculate how many iterations of the time loop you'll endure before you've tasted all the meal variations that meet these conditions.\n\n## Details\n\n#### Meal Composition\n\n- A meal consists of one or more dishes.\n- Each dish can be ordered no more than once per meal.\n- Dishes are served simultaneously, meaning the meal's composition does not depend on the order in which dishes are selected.\n- The total cost of a meal must be at least `a` and no more than `b`.\n\n#### Inputs\n\n- `menu`: A list containing the cost of each dish on the menu.\n- `a`, `b`: The minimum and maximum cost of a meal.\n\n#### Outputs\n\n- The minimum number of iterations of the time loop you'll endure (may be zero or very large).\n\n#### Additional Constraints\n\n- The cost of each dish is a whole, non-negative number.\n- Some dishes may cost the same as others.\n- The menu can contain any number of dishes from `1` to `1000`.\n- `a` and `b` are positive integers with `1 <= a <= b <= 1000`.\n\n#### Efficiency\n\nEfficiency is important in this problem. An inefficient solution will not pass the tests.\n\n#### Sample Input/Output\n\n    Input: Menu prices = [2, 3, 5]; a = 5; b = 10\n \nThe combinations are `[2,3]`, `[5]`, `[2,3,5]`, `[2,5]`, and `[3,5]`, so you'll need to endure `5` iterations of the time loop to try every meal.\n\n    Expected Output: 5",
