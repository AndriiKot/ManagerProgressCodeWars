  "description": "# The Situation\nIn my bathroom, there is a pile of `n` towels. A towel either has the color `red` or `blue`. We will represent the pile as sequence of `red` and `blue`.The leftmost towel is at the bottom of the pile, the rightmost towel is at the top of the pile.\n\nAs the week goes by, I use `t` towels. Whenever I grab a new one it's always the towel at the top of the pile.\nAll used towels are placed in a basket. \n\nAt the end of the week, I wash all used towels in the basket and put them on top of the existing pile again. \nBut my favorite color is `blue`, so I want to use `blue` towels as often as possible. Therefore, when the washed towels are placed on the pile again, the `blue` towels are always on top of the `red` towels.\n\n# An Example\nIf there are `n=5` towels, a pile may be:`blue, red, blue, red, blue`\n\nIf I grab `t=3` towels during the week, this will be the remaining pile at the end of the week: `blue, red`\n\nThe basket will contain the following towels: `blue, red, blue`\n\nAfter I sorted the washed towels and put them on the pile according to the rule described above, the resulting pile is:`blue, red, red, blue, blue`\n\n\n# Your Task: Sort the Pile\nYou are given an initial pile of towels as a sequence of the strings `\"red\"` and `\"blue\"`. \nOn top of that, you receive a sequence of non-negative integers. \nThe first integer describes the number of used towels `t` in the first week, the second integer describes the number of used towels `t` in the second week and so forth.\n\nMy question is: How will my pile of towels look like in the end, if I use `t` towels every week and place them on top of the the pile according to the rule defined above? \n\n# Notes\nIt is ensured that  `0 <= t <= n` \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
