  "description": "Mutual Recursion allows us to take the fun of regular recursion (where a function calls itself until a terminating condition) and apply it to multiple functions calling each other! \n\nLet's use the Hofstadter Female and Male sequences to demonstrate this technique. You'll want to create two functions `F` and `M` such that the following equations are true: \n\n```\nF(0) = 1\nM(0) = 0\nF(n) = n - M(F(n - 1))\nM(n) = n - F(M(n - 1))\n```\n\nDon't worry about negative numbers, `n` will always be greater than or equal to zero.\n\n~~~if:php,csharp\nYou *do* have to worry about performance though, mutual recursion uses up a lot of stack space (and is highly inefficient) so you may have to find a way to make your solution consume less stack space (and time).  Good luck :)\n~~~\n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n- Purity: `Let`\n- Number Encoding: `Scott`\n~~~\n\nHofstadter Wikipedia Reference http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter_sequence#Hofstadter_Female_and_Male_sequences\n",
