  "description": "A lot of goods have an [International Article Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number_%28EAN%29) (formerly known as \"European Article Number\") abbreviated \"EAN\". EAN is a 13-digit barcode consisting of 12 digits followed by a single-digit checksum (EAN-8 is not considered in this kata).\n\nThe single-digit checksum is calculated as follows (based upon the first 12 digits):\n\n* The digits at the first, third, fifth, etc. positions (i.e. at the odd positions) are multiplied by `1`.\n* The digits at the second, fourth, sixth, etc. positions (i.e. at the even positions) are multiplied by `3`.\n* Sum these results.\n\nIf this sum is divisible by `10`, the checksum is `0`. Otherwise the checksum has the following formula:\n\n```$\\text{checksum} = 10 - (\\text{sum} \\mod 10)$```\n\nFor example, calculate the checksum for `400330101839` (12 digits):\n\n```math\n4\\cdot 1 + 0\\cdot 3 + 0\\cdot 1 + 3\\cdot 3 + 3\\cdot 1 + 0\\cdot 3 + 1\\cdot 1 + 0\\cdot 3 + 1\\cdot 1 + 8\\cdot 3 + 3\\cdot 1 + 9\\cdot 3\n= 4 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 24 + 3 + 27\n= 72\\\\\n10 - (72 \\mod 10) = 8 \\Rightarrow \\text{Checksum}: 8\n```\n\nThus, the EAN-Code is 400330101839**8** (12 digits followed by single-digit checksum).\n \n## Your Task\n\nValidate a given EAN-Code. Return `True/true` if the given EAN-Code is valid, otherwise `False/false`.\n\n## Assumption\n\nYou can assume the given code is syntactically valid, i.e. it only consists of numbers and it exactly has a length of 13 characters.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n\"4003301018398\" - True\n\"4003301018392\" - False\n```\n\n\nGood Luck and have fun.\n",
