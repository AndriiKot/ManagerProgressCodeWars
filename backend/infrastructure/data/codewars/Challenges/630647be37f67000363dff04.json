We draw the top card of the deck.\n2. We take the next card, and put it at the bottom of the deck.\n3. We repeat steps 1 and 2 until there aren't any card left in the deck.\n\nLet's take a small deck containing four cards — named A, B, C, D — as an example:\n\n1. The deck order is `A-B-C-D` at the beginning, the card `A` is at the top and `D` at the bottom.\n2. `A` is drawn. The deck is now `B-C-D`.\n3. `B` is placed at the bottom of the deck. The deck is now `C-D-B`.\n4. `C` is drawn. The deck is now `D-B`.\n5. `D` is placed at the bottom of the deck. The deck is now `B-D`.\n6. `B` is drawn. The deck is now `D`.\n7. `D` is drawn.\n\nThe order of the cards drawn is `A-C-B-D`.\n\n# Your task\n\nWrite a function accepting a deck of cards as argument, and returning the cards drawn following the procedure.\n\n```javascript\nconst draw = (deck) => {\n```\n```coffeescript\ndraw = (deck) ->\n```\n\n```typescript\nexport const draw = (deck: string[]): string[] => {\n```\n\n```java\npublic static List<String> draw(List<String> deck) {\n```\n\n```scala\ndef draw(deck: Seq[String]): Seq[String] = ???\n```\n\nEach card is represented with a two-character string: the rank of the card and its suit.\n\n`AC 2C 3C 4C 5C 6C 7C 8C 9C TC JC QC KC` for the Clubs<br />\n`AD 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D 8D 9D TD JD QD KD` for the Diamonds<br />\n`AH 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H TH JH QH KH` for the Hearts<br />\n`AS 2S 3S 4S 5S 6S 7S 8S 9S TS JS QS KS` for the Spades<br />\n\nA preloaded function allows to easily print a deck to the console:\n\n```javascript\nprintDeck(deck, unicode);\n```\n\n```coffeescript\nprintDeck deck, unicode\n```\n\n```typescript\nimport { printDeck } from \"./preloaded\";\n\nprintDeck(deck, unicode);\n```\n\n```java\nDeckPrinter.printDeck(deck, unicode);\n```\n\n```scala\nimport Preloaded.printDeck\n\nprintDeck(deck, unicode)\n```\n\nThe first argument is the deck to print, the second one is a boolean value allowing the selection of the character set: regular or Unicode (for which a font containing the playing cards characters needs to be installed on your system).\n\n# Example\n\n```javascript\nconst deck = [\"KC\", \"KH\", \"QC\", \"KS\", \"KD\", \"QH\", \"QD\", \"QS\"];\n\ndraw(deck);\n```\n```coffeescript\ndeck = [\"KC\", \"KH\", \"QC\", \"KS\", \"KD\", \"QH\", \"QD\", \"QS\"]\n\ndraw deck\n```\n\n```typescript\nconst deck = [\"KC\", \"KH\", \"QC\", \"KS\", \"KD\", \"QH\", \"QD\", \"QS\"];\n\ndraw(deck);\n```\n\n```java\nList<String> deck = Arrays.asList(new String[] {\"KC\", \"KH\", \"QC\", \"KS\", \"KD\", \"QH\", \"QD\", \"QS\"});\n\nCardDraw.draw(deck);\n```\n\n```scala\nval deck = Seq(\"KC\", \"KH\", \"QC\", \"KS\", \"KD\", \"QH\", \"QD\", \"QS\")\n\ndraw(deck)\n```\n\nshould return:\n\n```javascript\n[\"KC\", \"QC\", \"KD\", \"QD\", \"KH\", \"QH\", \"KS\", \"QS\"];\n```\n```coffeescript\n[\"KC\", \"QC\", \"KD\", \"QD\", \"KH\", \"QH\", \"KS\", \"QS\"]\n```\n\n```typescript\n[\"KC\", \"QC\", \"KD\", \"QD\", \"KH\", \"QH\", \"KS\", \"QS\"];\n```\n\n```java\n[\"KC\", \"QC\", \"KD\", \"QD\", \"KH\", \"QH\", \"KS\", \"QS\"];\n```\n\n```scala\nSeq(\"KC\", \"QC\", \"KD\", \"QD\", \"KH\", \"QH\", \"KS\", \"QS\")\n```\n\n# Have fun!\n\nI hope you will enjoy this kata! Feedbacks and translations are very welcome.\n\nAfter this one, jump to [Part 2](https://www.codewars.com/kata/6311b2ce73f648002577f04a), where we will be ordering the deck to be drawn to have a chosen result!\n",
