  "description": "You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N.\n\n```if-not:rust\nIf there is no index that would make this happen, return `-1`.\n```\n\n```if:rust\nIf there is no index that would make this happen, return `None`.\n```\n\n### For example:\n\nLet's say you are given the array `{1,2,3,4,3,2,1}`:  \nYour function will return the index `3`, because the sum of left side of the index (`{1,2,3}`) and the sum of the right side of the index (`{3,2,1}`) both equal `6`.\n\n\nLet's look at another one.  \nYou are given the array `{1,100,50,-51,1,1}`:  \nYour function will return the index `1`, because the sum of left side of the index (`{1}`) and the sum of the right side of the index (`{50,-51,1,1}`) both equal `1`.\n\nLast one:  \nYou are given the array `{20,10,-80,10,10,15,35}`  \nAt index 0 the left side is `{}`  \nThe right side is `{10,-80,10,10,15,35}`  \nThey both are equal to `0` when added. (Empty arrays are equal to 0 in this problem)  \nIndex 0 is the place where the left side and right side are equal.  \n\nNote: Please remember that in most languages the index of an array starts at 0.\n\n### Input\n\nAn integer array of length `0 < arr < 1000`. The numbers in the array can be any integer positive or negative.\n\n### Output\n\nThe lowest index `N` where the side to the left of `N` is equal to the side to the right of `N`. If you do not find an index that fits these rules, then you will return `-1`.\n\n### Note\n\nIf you are given an array with multiple answers, return the lowest correct index.  \n\n~~~if:lambdacalc\n### Encodings\n\npurity: `LetRec`  \nnumEncoding: custom `NegaBinaryScott`  \n\nExport constructors `nil, cons` for your `List` encoding.  \n`NegaBinaryScott` is just like `BinaryScott`, but uses base `-2` instead of `2`.\n~~~",
