  "description": "### Disclaimer\n\nThis kata is in accordance with the EPIC challenge in relation to Andela's 10 year anniversary celebration. You can find more info [here](https://www.codewars.com/post/introducing-the-epic-challenge-2024) \n\n### Story\nejini战神 has recently quit his programming job and is now opting in for a career change. He has decided to settle in the baking industry and is now a worker of a cake franchise designated for wedding celebrations. He has come up with a creative wedding cake model and a unique box that can modify the cake in a certain way that can blow away all the attendees!!! (*How cool is that~ 😏*)\n\n## Task\nGiven the **cake model**, your job is to help ejini战神 write a program that can instantly display the final visualization of the cake model after the unique box has been unfolded. \n\nInitial cake model below:\n\n```\n    /|\\\n   \\/ \\/\n  \\ | | \\\n  /\\/\\/\\/\n /       \\\n/|||||||||\\\n```\n\nThe final visualization:\n\n```\n    /|\\\n   \\ | /\n  \\  |  \\\n  /  |  /\n /   |   \\\n/    |    \\\n```\n\nMore examples:\n\n* ```\n        \\         \\\n      // |||||||||\\\\/\n     \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n     / /| \\ /\\|\\ /| |/\n  /||||||||\\/| /\\||||||\\\\\n  ```\n  \n  becomes\n\n  ```\n        \\    |    \\\n      /      |      /\n     \\       |       \\\n     /       |       /\n  /          |          \\\n  ```\n*  ```\n      /         \\\n      /         \\ \n      /         \\\n      /         \\\n      /         \\\n      /         \\ \n   ```\n   \n   becomes\n\n   ```\n      /    |    \\\n      /    |    \\ \n      /    |    \\\n      /    |    \\\n      /    |    \\\n      /    |    \\ \n   ```\n\n**Notes**\n* Each cake model will have at least 1 layer (row), separated by a newline character (`\\n`)\n* Each layer will only consist of **odd number of filling space**\n* The lower layer will have **equal or more filling space** than the upper ones\n* Each layer will always start and end with `/` or `\\` fillings\n* Starting and ending position of each layer **will not overlap**\n* Inner fillings of the cake may be `/`, `\\` or `|`\n* Some part of the cake do not have fillings (*due to the semi-functional cake creation model...*)\n* Trailing and leading spaces for the visualization above **will not be included** in the cake model's input and final output.\n* `\\\\` for **visualization above only** is considered as 2 fillings rather than 1.\n* Output should be the same as the given input except with all fillings of each layer centralized whilst leaving a starting and ending filling to prevent it from overflow ^^. (Refer to examples above)\n\n\n      ",
