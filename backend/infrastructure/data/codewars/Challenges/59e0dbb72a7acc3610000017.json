  "description": "Two integers are coprimes if the their only greatest common divisor is 1.\n\n## Task\nIn this kata you'll be given a number ```n >= 2``` and output a list with all positive integers less than ```gcd(n, k) == 1```, with ```k``` being any of the output numbers.\n\nThe list cannot include duplicated entries and has to be sorted.\n\n\n## Examples\n```\n2 -> [1]\n3 -> [1, 2]\n6 -> [1, 5]\n10 -> [1, 3, 7, 9]\n20 -> [1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19]\n25 -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24]\n30 -> [1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]\n```",
