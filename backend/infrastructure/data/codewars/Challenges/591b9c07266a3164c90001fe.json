  "description": "[Gratipay](https://gratipay.com) helps fund open source projects by providing a platform for weekly tips/donations. The current homepage lists **all** projects, along with images. Due to an ever-increasing number of projects, Gratipay is now hitting scaling problems! Help Gratipay  design a solution such that only a handful of 'featured' projects are displayed on the homepage. \n\nAt the heart of this solution, lies a single function: \n\n```ruby\ndef get_featured_projects(all_projects) \n  ...\nend\n```\n```python\ndef get_featured_projects(all_projects):\n  ...\n```\n```javascript\nfunction getFeaturedProjects(allProjects) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n```java\npublic static Project[] getFeaturedProjects(Project[] projects) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n\n`all_projects` is an array of projects, which are dictionaries/hashes of the format: \n\n```ruby\n{\n  name: \"Project name\",\n  nreceiving_from: 10,\n  receiving:  10,\n}\n```\n```python\n{\n  'name': 'Project name',\n  'nreceiving_from': 10,\n  'receiving':  10,\n}\n```\n```javascript\n{\n  \"name\": \"Project name\",\n  \"nreceiving_from\": 10,\n  \"receiving\":  10,\n}\n```\n```java\npublic class Project {\n    public final String name;\n    public final int nreceivingFrom;\n    public final int receiving;\n}\n```\n\n`get_featured_projects`/`getFeaturedProjects` is expected to filter out a list of featured projects,  based on the following specification:\n\n- Always return 10 projects or less.\n- Seven of the projects should be drawn randomly from a pool of the popular projects (a project with `nreceiving_from` > 5 is considered as popular). The remaining three should be taken randomly from amongst the rest.\n- If there are less than 10 projects in total,  just return all projects. \n- If there are less than 7 popular projects,  or less than 3 unpopular projects, fill the gaps from the other group of projects if possible. \n- Randomize the order of results so that the popular projects don't always appear on top\n\nNote: Gratipay's codebase is [open source](https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com), try to resist the temptation to cheat!",
