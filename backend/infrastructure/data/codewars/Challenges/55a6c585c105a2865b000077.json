  "description": "Does an array contain all the elements of another array?\n\nSometimes you want to know if all of the elements from one array are present in another.\nSometimes your array is not a set and contains duplicate elements that you still want to account for.\n\nExamples:\n```\n[1,2,3] contains [2,3]\n[1,2,2,3,3,3] contains [2,3,3]\n[1,2,2,3,3,3] does not contain [2,2,2,3,3] - too many 2's\n```\n\nAnd sometimes you need to be strict.\n```\n[1.0,2.0,3.0] does not contain [1,2,3] - Floats are not Fixnums\n```\n(But arrays may also be mixed and contain more than one object type.)\n\nCreate a method called `contains_all?` which takes 2 arguments, `haystack` the array you need to check through and `needle` the array of elements you are looking for, and returns a boolean `true` or `false`.\n\n\nOne more thing, You should make sure your arrays are still intact after the comparison.\n\n\nThis kata is similar to, but stricter than http://www.codewars.com/kata/does-array-x-contain-all-values-within-array-y\n\n\nNote to Translators: \nThe original kata version is in Ruby.\n\n",
