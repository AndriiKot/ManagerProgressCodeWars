  "description": "Given a time in AM/PM format as a string, convert it to 24-hour [military time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Military_time) time as a string.\n\nMidnight is `12:00:00AM` on a 12-hour clock, and `00:00:00` on a 24-hour clock. Noon is `12:00:00PM` on a 12-hour clock, and `12:00:00` on a 24-hour clock\n\nTry not to use built-in Date/Time libraries.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n\"07:05:45PM\"  -->  \"19:05:45\"\n\"12:00:01AM\"  -->  \"00:00:01\"\n\"11:46:47PM\"  -->  \"23:46:47\"\n```",
