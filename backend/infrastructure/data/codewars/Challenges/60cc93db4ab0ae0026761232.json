  "description": "## Task\n\nA list S  will be given. You need to generate a list T from it by following the given process:\n\n1) Remove the first and last element from the list S and add them to the list T.\n2) Reverse the list S\n3) Repeat the process until list S gets emptied.\n\nThe above process results in the depletion of the list S.\nYour task is to generate list T **without mutating** the input List S.\n\n\n## Example\n\n```\nS = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\nT = []\n\nS = [2,3,4,5] => [5,4,3,2]\nT = [1,6]\n\nS = [4,3] => [3,4]\nT = [1,6,5,2]\n\nS = []\nT = [1,6,5,2,3,4]\nreturn T\n```\n\n## Note\n\n```if:d\n* size of S goes up to `300,000`\n* Keep the efficiency of your code in mind.\n```\n```if-not:bf,d\n* size of S goes up to `10^6`\n* Keep the efficiency of your code in mind.\n* Do not mutate the Input.\n\n```\n```if:bf\n* Input will be a string \n* 1<=Input string length<100\n* The Input will consist of alphabets (Upper and lowercase), Numbers and special characters.\n* The input will be terminated with a null character for EOF.\n```",
