  "description": "For this challenge you need to create a SELECT statement that will contain data about departments that had a sale with a price over 98.00 dollars. This SELECT statement will have to use an EXISTS to achieve the task.\n\n### departments table schema\n- id\n- name\n\n### sales table schema\n- id\n- department_id (department foreign key)\n- name\n- price\n- card_name\n- card_number\n- transaction_date\n\n### resultant table schema\n- id\n- name\n\n> NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.\n> Do not: alias tables as this can cause a failure.",
