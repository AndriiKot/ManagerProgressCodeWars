  "description": "You are going to be given a word. Your job will be to make sure that each character in that word has the exact same number of occurrences. You will return `true` if it is valid, or `false` if it is not.\n\nFor this kata, capitals are considered the same as lowercase letters. Therefore: `\"A\" == \"a\"` \n\nThe input is a string (with no spaces) containing `[a-z],[A-Z],[0-9]` and common symbols. The length will be `0 < length < 100`.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n* `\"abcabc\"` is a valid word because `\"a\"` appears twice, `\"b\"` appears twice, and`\"c\"` appears twice.  \n* `\"abcabcd\"` is **NOT** a valid word because `\"a\"` appears twice, `\"b\"` appears twice, `\"c\"` appears twice, but `\"d\"` only appears once!  \n* `\"123abc!\"` is a valid word because all of the characters only appear once in the word.",
