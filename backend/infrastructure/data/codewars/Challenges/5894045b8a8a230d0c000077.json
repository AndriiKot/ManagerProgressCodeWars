  "description": "# Task\n You are given an array of integers `arr` that representing coordinates of obstacles situated on a straight line.\n\n Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate 0 to the right. You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by some integer.\n\n Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.\n\n# Example\n\n For `arr = [5, 3, 6, 7, 9]`, the output should be `4`.\n\n Check out the image below for better understanding:\n\n \n<img src = \"https://codefightsuserpics.s3.amazonaws.com/tasks/avoidObstacles/img/example.png?_tm=1476261772863\" />\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer array `arr`\n\n    Non-empty array of positive integers.\n\n    Constraints: `1 ≤ inputArray[i] ≤ 100.`\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\n    The desired length.",
