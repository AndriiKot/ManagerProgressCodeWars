  "description": "The citizens of Codeland read each word from right to left, meaning that lexicographical comparison works differently in their language. Namely, string ```a``` is <i>lexicographically smaller</i> than string ```b``` if either: ```a``` is a suffix of ```b``` (in common sense, i.e. ```b``` ends with a substring equal to ```a```); or their last ```k``` characters are the same but the ```(k + 1)th``` character from the right in string ```a``` is smaller than the same character in string ```b```.\n\nGiven an array of words in Codeland language, sort them lexicographically according to Codeland's unique rules.\n\nFor ```words = [\"nigeb\", \"ta\", \"eht\", \"gninnigeb\"]```, the output should be\n```unusualLexOrder(words) = [\"ta\", \"nigeb\", \"gninnigeb\", \"eht\"]```.\n\nIn particular, ```\"ta\" < \"nigeb\"``` because ```'a' < 'b'``` and ```\"nigeb\" < \"gninnigeb\"``` because the former word is a suffix of the latter.\n\nS: <i>codefights.com</i>",
