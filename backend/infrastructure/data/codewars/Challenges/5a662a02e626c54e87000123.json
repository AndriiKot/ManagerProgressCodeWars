  "description": "### Definition\n\nAn **extra perfect number** is a positive integer whose **first and last bits** in binary representation are **set** (i.e., both are `1`).\n\n### Task\n\nGiven a positive integer `N`, return all the extra perfect numbers in the range from `1` to `N`, inclusive.\n\n### Warm-up (Recommended)\n\nPart of the [Playing With Numbers Series](https://www.codewars.com/collections/playing-with-numbers)\n\n### Notes\n\n- The input is always a **positive integer**.\n- The returned list/array should contain the extra perfect numbers in **ascending order**, from **lowest to highest**.\n- Extra perfect numbers correspond to binary representations that start and end with `1`.\n\n---\n\n### Input >> Output Examples\n\n~~~python\nextraPerfect(3)  ==>  return {1, 3}\n~~~\n\n#### Explanation:\n\n- `1` in binary is `1` → first and last bits are set.\n- `3` in binary is `11` → first and last bits are set.\n\n---\n\n~~~python\nextraPerfect(7)  ==>  return {1, 3, 5, 7}\n~~~\n\n#### Explanation:\n\n- `5` in binary is `101` → first and last bits are set.\n- `7` in binary is `111` → first and last bits are set.\n\n---\n\n### Related Collections\n\n- [Playing with Numbers Series](https://www.codewars.com/collections/playing-with-numbers)  \n- [Playing With Lists/Arrays Series](https://www.codewars.com/collections/playing-with-lists-slash-arrays)  \n- [More Katas by MrZizoScream](http://www.codewars.com/users/MrZizoScream/authored)\n\n",
