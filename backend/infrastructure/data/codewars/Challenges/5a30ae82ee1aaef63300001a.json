  "description": "In Spanish, sentences not only end with exclamation and question marks, but also begin with them (actually flipped over version).\n\nIt looks like:\n\n```\n¿Cómo estás?      -> How are you?\n¡Es maravilloso!  -> It is wonderful!\n```\n\nKeeping in mind only the above-mentioned fact, your task is to find out how many sentences in unput ```array``` are \"spanish\" and return '¡n spanish sentence(s) here and hasta la vista, baby!'\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nspanishSent(['How are you?', '¿How are you?',  'It is you', '¡It is you', '¡You are hot!'])  -> '¡2 spanish sentences here and hasta la vista, baby!'\n\nspanishSent(['¿How are you', '¿How are you?', '!It is me', 'You are.'])  -> '¡1 spanish sentence here and hasta la vista, baby!'\n\n```\nP.S. Array's length > 0.",
