  "description": "The factorial function is defined as follows:\n```\n0! = 1\nn! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * n-2 * n-1 * n\n```\n\nUsually, the factorials of large numbers will have trailing zeroes. Your task is to create a function which returns the number of trailing zeroes of `num!` in a given `base`.\n\nHere's two examples to get you started:\n```python\n(num = 15, base = 10) => 3\n# 15! = 1307674368000, which has 3 trailing 0's\n\n(num = 7, base = 2) => 4\n# 7! = 5040 = 0b1001110110000, which has 4 trailing 0's\n```\n\nYour code should be able to handle some very large numbers.\n\nNote: \n - `num` >= 0\n - `base` >= 2\n\nHINT: Should you not make any headway after trying a long time, you should try [this kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/number-of-trailing-zeros-of-n) first.\n",
