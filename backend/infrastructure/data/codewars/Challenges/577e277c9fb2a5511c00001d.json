  "description": "You get a `text` and have to shift the vowels by `n` positions to the right. (Negative value for n should shift to the left.)\n\n`Position` means the vowel's position if taken as one item in a list of all vowels within the string.\n\nA shift by 1 would mean, that every vowel shifts to the place of the next vowel.\n\nShifting over the edges of the text should continue at the other edge.\n\nVowels are \"aeiou\" / \"AEIOU\".\n\nIf text is null or empty, then simply return back the original text.\n\n### Example:\n\n```python\ntext = \"This is a test!\"\nn = 1\noutput = \"Thes is i tast!\"\n\ntext = \"This is a test!\"\nn = 3\noutput = \"This as e tist!\"\n```\n\n---\n\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)\n\nI have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.",
