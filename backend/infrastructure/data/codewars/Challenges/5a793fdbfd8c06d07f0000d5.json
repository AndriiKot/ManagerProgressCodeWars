  "description": "Consider the following expansion:\n\n```\n\"3(ab)\"     expands to \"ababab\"    -- because \"ab\" repeats 3 times\n\"2(a3(b))\"  expands to \"abbbabbb\"  -- \"a3(b)\" expands to \"abbb\" and that repeats twice\n```\n\nGiven a string, return the expansion of that string.\n\nRules:\n\n- The input is guaranteed to be well-formed and balanced.\n- Multipliers are single digits in the range 1–9, and are optional.\n- Every multiplier is immediately followed by a parenthesised group.\n- After a group is fully expanded, nothing appears beyond the final closing parenthesis.\n\nLowercase letters and digits are the only characters that appear.\n",
