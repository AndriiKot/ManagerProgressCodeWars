  "description": "We are diligently pursuing our elusive operative, **Matthew Knight**, who also goes by the alias **Roy Miller**. He employs a nomadic lifestyle to evade detection, constantly moving from one location to another, with each of his journeys following a perplexing and non-standard sequence of **itineraries**. Our mission is to *decipher the routes* he will undertake during each of his voyages.\n\n## Task \n\nYou've been provided with an array of itinerary `routes`, decipher the **precise destinations** he will visit in the correct sequence according to his meticulously planned itineraries.\n\n## Example\n\nBased on the provided routes:\n\n```\n[ [USA, BRA], [JPN, PHL], [BRA, UAE], [UAE, JPN] ]\n```\n\nThe correct sequence of destinations is:\n\n```\n\"USA, BRA, UAE, JPN, PHL\"\n```\n\n**Note:** \n\n* You can safely assume that there will be *no duplicate locations* with distinct `routes`.\n* All `routes` provided will have *non-empty itineraries*.\n* There will always be *at least one (1)* route connecting one waypoint to another.\n",
