  "description": "We need a function that receives an array or list of integers (positive and negative) and may give us the following information in the order and  structure presented below:\n\n`[(1), (2), (3), [[(4)], 5]]`\n\n(1) - Total amount of received integers.\n\n(2) - Total amount of different values the array has.\n\n(3) - Total amount of values that occur only once.\n\n(4) and (5) both in a list\n\n(4) - It is (or they are) the element(s) that has (or have) the maximum occurrence. If there are more than one, the elements should be sorted (by their value obviously)\n\n(5) - Maximum occurrence of the integer(s)\n\n_____\nLet's see some cases:\n\n```\nfor list [-3, -2, -1, 3, 4, -5, -5, 5, -1, -5] ----> [10, 7, 5, [[-5], 3]]\n\n(1) - The list has ten elements (10 numbers)\n\n(2) - We have seven different values: -5, -3, -2, -1, 3, 4, 5 (7 values)\n\n(3) - The numbers that occur only once: -3, -2, 3, 4, 5 (5 values)\n\n(4) and (5) - The number -5 occurs three times (3 occurrences)\n\n\n\nfor list [4, 4, 2, -3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 0, -5, 2, -2, -2, -5] ----> [14, 8, 4, [[2, 4], 3]]\n```\n\nEnjoy it and happy coding!!",
