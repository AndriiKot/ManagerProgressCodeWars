  "description": "In this kata we have to create a function that will give us some specific information of a data base. We have a sequence of postive integers that is registered by OEIS with the code [001055](https://oeis.org/A001055). This sequence give us the amount of ways that a number may be expressed as a product of its factors (including the number itself multiplied by one.)\n\nThe first terms of this sequence are shown below:\n\n```python\nn-th term    a(n)\n1             1\n2             1\n3             1\n4             2\n5             1\n6             2\n7             1\n8             3\n9             2\n10            2\n11            1\n12            4\n13            1\n14            2\n15            2\n16            5\n```\n\nIn the preloaded section you are given a hash table named `A001055` (Python and JavaScript) or `$a001055` (Ruby), where keys are the numbers from `1` to `1006`, and the values are the respective terms of the aforementioned sequence.\n\nYou have to create the function that receives three arguments:\n\n1. An array with 2 elements that represent the numbers in range `[a, b]` to be considered.\n2. A string with five possible valid values: `\"equals to\"`, `\"higher than\"`, `\"lower than\"`, `\"higher and equals to\"`, and `\"lower and equals to\"` (any other value is considered invalid).\n3. The element of the `A001055` sequence.\n\nThe function should return the amount of numbers that fulfill our conditions and a sorted list of these numbers.\n\n## Examples\n\n1) We want to know about the numbers between `10` and `21` (included) that have more than `1` multiplicative partition:\n\n```\nrange = [10, 21]\nstr = \"higher than\"\nval = 1\n\nresult = (8, [10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21])\n```\n\n2) We want to know the numbers between `25` and `75` that have more than or equals to `5` multiplicative partitions:\n\n```\nrange = [25, 75]\nstr = \"higher and equals to\"\nval = 5\n\nresult = (13, [30, 32, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 64, 66, 70, 72])\n```\n\n3) If the string command is wrong, the function will return `\"wrong constraint\"`:\n\n```\nrange = [25, 75]\nstr = \"qwerty\"\nval = 5\n\nresult = \"wrong constraint\"\n```\n\nEnjoy it!!",
