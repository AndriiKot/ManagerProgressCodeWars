This challenge will help you practice these skills by creating a function that wraps text in various programming comment styles.\n\nBeing able to wrap text in comments is a valuable skill in programming. Comments are crucial for documenting code, explaining complex logic, and providing context for future developers (or yourself) who may work on the code later. They help improve code readability and maintainability, making it easier to understand the purpose and functionality of different sections of code. Furthermore, different programming languages have their own conventions for comments, so knowing how to format them correctly is an important aspect of writing clean and professional code.\n\nThis challenge teaches the basics of comment formatting across various languages. However, for a full understanding of each language's commenting conventions and capabilities, it is essential to consult the official documentation of that language.\n\n---\n\n### Specification\n- For **Bash** style comments, use `#` at the beginning of each line.\n- For **Bash Multiline** style comments, use `: \"` at the beginning and `\"` at the end, each on their own line.\n- For **JavaDoc** style comments, use `/**` at the beginning and `*/` at the end, each on their own line, with each line of the original text prefixed by `*`.\n- For **Python** style comments, use `#` at the beginning of each line.\n- For **Python Multiline** style comments, use `\"\"\"` at the beginning and end of the text, each on their own line.\n- For **JavaScript** style comments, use `//` at the beginning of each line.\n- For **JavaScript Multiline** style comments, use `/*` at the beginning and `*/` at the end, each on their own line.\n- For **SGML** (HTML) style comments, use `<!--` at the beginning and `-->` at the end, with each line wrapped individually.\n- For **SQL** style comments, use `--` at the beginning of each line.\n\n### Focus points\n- Make sure to add a space between the comment symbols and the text where applicable.\n- Use `'\\n'` as line separator when wrapping text.\n- The text to wrap will never contain special characters that need to be escaped.\n- The text to wrap can consist of one or multiple lines, using `'\\n'` as line separator.\n\n### Task Description\nYour task is to create a function that takes two parameters:\n1. `text`: A string containing the text to be wrapped in comments.\n2. `style`: A string indicating the style of comments to use. It can be one of the following:\n   - \"Bash\"\n   - \"Bash Multiline\"\n   - \"JavaDoc\"\n   - \"Python\"\n   - \"Python Multiline\"\n   - \"Javascript\"\n   - \"Javascript Multiline\"\n   - \"SGML\"\n   - \"SQL\"\n\nThe function should wrap the given text in the appropriate comment style and return the result.\n\n### Examples\n\n1. Input:\n   ```javascript\n   text = \"Hello World!\"\n   style = \"Bash\"\n   ```\n   Output:\n   ```plaintext\n   # Hello World!\n   ```\n\n2. Input:\n   ```javascript\n   text = \"Hello World!\"\n   style = \"JavaDoc\"\n   ```\n   Output:\n   ```plaintext\n   /**\n    * Hello World!\n    */\n   ```\n\n3. Input:\n   ```javascript\n   text = \"Hello\\nWorld!\"\n   style = \"SGML\"\n   ```\n   Output:\n   ```plaintext\n   <!-- Hello -->\n   <!-- World! -->\n   ```\n\n### Testing\nYou can test your function using a set of predefined test cases that cover both single-line and multi-line inputs for each comment style.\n\n---\n\n> For those seeking a greater challenge, consider testing your skills in string interpolation.\n\nGood luck, and happy commenting!\n",
