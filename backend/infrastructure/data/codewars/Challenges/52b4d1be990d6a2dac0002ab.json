  "description": "Write a method that takes an array of signed integers, and returns the longest contiguous subsequence of this array that has a total sum of elements of exactly `0`.\n\nIf more than one equally long subsequences have a zero sum, return the one starting at the highest index.\n\nFor example:  \n`maxZeroSequenceLength([25, -35, 12, 6, 92, -115, 17, 2, 2, 2, -7, 2, -9, 16, 2, -11])` should return  \n`[92, -115, 17, 2, 2, 2]`, because this is the longest zero-sum sequence in the array.",
