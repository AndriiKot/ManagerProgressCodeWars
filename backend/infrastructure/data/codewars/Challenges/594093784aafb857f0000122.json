  "description": "Find the difference between two collections. The difference means that either the element is present in one collection or it is present in other, but not in both. Return a sorted list with the difference.\n\nThe collections can contain duplicates; the difference should not contain duplicates.\n\n## Example\n\n```\nA = [a, a, t, e, f, i, j]\n\nB = [t, g, g, i, k, f]\n\ndifference = [a, e, g, j, k]\n```",
