  "description": "The distance formula can be used to find the distance between two points. What if we were trying to walk from point **A** to point **B**, but there were buildings in the way? We would need some other formula..but which?\n\n\n### Manhattan Distance\n\n[Manhattan distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance) is the distance between two points in a grid (like the grid-like street geography of the New York borough of Manhattan) calculated by only taking a vertical and/or horizontal path.\n\nComplete the function that accepts two points and returns the Manhattan Distance between the two points.\n\nThe points are arrays or tuples containing the `x` and `y` coordinate in the grid. You can think of `x` as the row in the grid, and `y` as the column.\n\n\n### Examples\n```\n* Input [1, 1], [1, 1] => Output 0\n* Input [5, 4], [3, 2] => Output 4\n* Input [1, 1], [0, 3] => Output 3\n```\n",
