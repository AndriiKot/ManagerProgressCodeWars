  "description": "For this challenge you need to create a SELECT statement, this SELECT statement will use an IN to check whether a department has had a sale with a price over 90.00 dollars BUT the sql MUST use the WITH statement which will be used to select all columns from `sales` where the price is greater than 90.00, you must call this sub-query `special_sales`.\n\n### departments table schema\n- id\n- name\n\n### sales table schema\n- id\n- department_id (department foreign key)\n- name\n- price\n- card_name\n- card_number\n- transaction_date\n\n### resultant table schema\n- id\n- name\n\n> NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.",
