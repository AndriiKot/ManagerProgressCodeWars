  "description": "Here is a new kata that Codewars asked me to do related to interviewing and working in a production setting.\n\nYou might be familar with and have used Angular.js. Among other things, it lets you create your own filters that work as functions. You can then put these in a page to perform specific data changes, such as shortening a number to display a more concise notation.\n\nIn this kata, we will create a function which returns another function (or process, in Ruby) that shortens very long numbers. Given an initial array of values replace the Xth power of a given base. If the input of the returned function is not a numerical string, it should return the input itself as a string.\n\nHere's an example, which is worth a thousand words:\n```javascript\nfilter1 = shortenNumber(['','k','m'],1000);\nfilter1('234324') == '234k';\nfilter1('98234324') == '98m';\nfilter1([1,2,3]) == '1,2,3';\nfilter2 = shortenNumber(['B','KB','MB','GB'],1024);\nfilter2('32') == '32B';\nfilter2('2100') == '2KB';\nfilter2('pippi') == 'pippi';\n```\n```python\nfilter1 = shorten_number(['','k','m'],1000)\nfilter1('234324') == '234k'\nfilter1('98234324') == '98m'\nfilter1([1,2,3]) == '[1,2,3]'\nfilter2 = shorten_number(['B','KB','MB','GB'],1024)\nfilter2('32') == '32B'\nfilter2('2100') == '2KB';\nfilter2('pippi') == 'pippi'\n```\n```csharp\nvar filter1 = shortenMethods.ShortenNumberCreator(new string[] { \"\", \"k\", \"m\" }, 1000);\nfilter1(\"234324\") == \"234k\";\nfilter1(\"98234324\") == \"98m\";\nfilter1(new int[] { 1,2,3 }) == \"1,2,3\";\nvar filter2 = shortenMethods.ShortenNumberCreator(new string[] { \"B\", \"KB\", \"MB\", \"GB\" }, 1024);\nfilter2(\"32\") == \"32B\";\nfilter2(\"2100\") == \"2KB\";\nfilter2(\"pippi\") == \"pippi\";\n```\n```ruby\nfilter1 = shorten_number(['','k','m'],1000)\nfilter1.call('234324') == '234k'\nfilter1.call('98234324') == '98m'\nfilter1({}) == '{}'\nfilter2 = shortenNumber(['B','KB','MB','GB'],1024)\nfilter2.call('32') == '32B';\nfilter2.call('2100') == '2KB';\nfilter2.call('pippi') == 'pippi'\n```\n\nIf you like to test yourself on kata related to actual work and interviews, consider trying this kata where you will build [a breadcrumb generator](http://www.codewars.com/kata/563fbac924106b8bf7000046)",
