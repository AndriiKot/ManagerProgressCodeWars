  "description": "The aim of the kata is to decompose `n!` (factorial n) into its prime factors.\n\nExamples:\n```\nn = 12; decomp(12) -> \"2^10 * 3^5 * 5^2 * 7 * 11\"\nsince 12! is divisible by 2 ten times, by 3 five times, by 5 two times and by 7 and 11 only once.\n\nn = 22; decomp(22) -> \"2^19 * 3^9 * 5^4 * 7^3 * 11^2 * 13 * 17 * 19\"\n\nn = 25; decomp(25) -> 2^22 * 3^10 * 5^6 * 7^3 * 11^2 * 13 * 17 * 19 * 23\n```\n\nPrime numbers should be in increasing order. When the exponent of a prime is 1 don't put the exponent.\n\nNotes\n\n- the function is `decomp(n)` and should return the decomposition of `n!` into its prime factors in increasing order of the primes, as a string.\n- factorial can be a very big number (`4000! has 12674 digits`, n can go from 300 to 4000).\n- In Fortran - as in any other language - the returned string is not permitted to contain any redundant trailing whitespace: you can use `dynamically allocated character strings`.\n\n",
